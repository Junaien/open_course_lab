1
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,421
This is lecture twelve.

2
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:13,920
OK.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,650
We've reached twelve lectures.

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,590
And this one is more than
the others about applications

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,890
of linear algebra.

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,630
And I'll confess.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,010
When I'm giving you examples
of the null space and the row

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,470
space, I create a little matrix.

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,970
You probably see that I
just invent that matrix

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,540
as I'm going.

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,240
And I feel a little
guilty about it,

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:49,090
because the truth is that real
linear algebra uses matrices

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,570
that come from somewhere.

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,470
They're not just, like, randomly
invented by the instructor.

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,740
They come from applications.

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,560
They have a definite structure.

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:07,330
And anybody who works with
them gets, uses that structure.

18
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,330
I'll just report,
like, this weekend

19
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,560
I was at an event with
chemistry professors.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,180
OK, those guys are row
reducing matrices, and what

21
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,250
matrices are they working with?

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,350
Well, their little matrices tell
them how much of each element

23
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,400
goes into the --

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,920
or each molecule, how
many molecules of each

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,170
go into a reaction
and what comes out.

26
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,460
And by row reduction they
get a clearer picture

27
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,030
of a complicated reaction.

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,650
And this weekend I'm going to --

29
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,720
to a sort of birthday
party at Mathworks.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,060
So Mathworks is out
Route 9 in Natick.

31
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,640
That's where Matlab is created.

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,840
It's a very, very
successful, software,

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,750
tremendously successful.

34
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,650
And the conference will be about
how linear algebra is used.

35
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,500
And so I feel
better today to talk

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,990
about what I think is
the most important model

37
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,040
in applied math.

38
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,130
And the discrete
version is a graph.

39
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,710
So can I draw a graph?

40
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,590
Write down the matrix
that's associated with it,

41
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,670
and that's a great
source of matrices.

42
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,500
You'll see.

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,260
So a graph is
just, so a graph --

44
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,500
to repeat -- has
nodes and edges.

45
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,720
OK.

46
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,100
And I'm going to write down
the graph, a graph, so I'm just

47
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,730
creating a small graph here.

48
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,140
As I mentioned last time,
we would be very interested

49
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,600
in the graph of all, websites.

50
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,970
Or the graph of all telephones.

51
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,980
I mean -- or the graph of
all people in the world.

52
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:18,550
Here let me take just,
maybe nodes one two three --

53
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,910
well, I better put in an --

54
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:25,350
I'll put in that edge and maybe
an edge to, to a node four,

55
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,810
and another edge to node four.

56
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,340
How's that?

57
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,480
So there's a graph
with four nodes.

58
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,790
So n will be four in my --

59
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,945
n equal four nodes.

60
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,330
And the matrix will have
m equal the number --

61
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,170
there'll be a row
for every edge,

62
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,080
so I've got one two
three four five edges.

63
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,310
So that will be
the number of rows.

64
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,290
And I have to to write down
the matrix that I want to,

65
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,170
I want to study, I need to
give a direction to every edge,

66
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,710
so I know a plus and
a minus direction.

67
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,240
So I'll just do
that with an arrow.

68
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,580
Say from one to two, one
to three, two to three,

69
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,940
one to four, three to four.

70
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:24,690
That just tells me, if I have
current flowing on these edges

71
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,260
then I know whether it's
-- to count it as positive

72
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,880
or negative according as whether
it's with the arrow or against

73
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,110
the arrow.

74
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,880
But I just drew those
arrows arbitrarily.

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,460
OK.

76
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,960
Because I -- my example is going
to come -- the example I'll --

77
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,750
the words that I will use
will be words like potential,

78
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,570
potential difference, currents.

79
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,690
In other words, I'm
thinking of an electrical

80
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,690
network.

81
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,470
But that's just one possibility.

82
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,890
My applied math class
builds on this example.

83
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,770
It could be a hydraulic
network, so we could be doing,

84
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,940
flow of water, flow of oil.

85
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:18,080
Other examples, this
could be a structure.

86
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,120
Like the -- a design
for a bridge or a design

87
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,030
for a Buckminster Fuller dome.

88
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,240
Or many other
possibilities, so many.

89
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,340
So l- but let's take
potentials and currents

90
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,170
as, as a basic
example, and let me

91
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,020
create the matrix that tells
you exactly what the graph tells

92
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,520
you.

93
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,394
That's --, that's it.

94
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:49,876
So now I'll call it the
incidence matrix, incidence

95
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:50,375
matrix.

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,760
So let me write it
down, and you'll see,

97
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,950
OK.

98
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,140
what its properties are.

99
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,900
So every row
corresponds to an edge.

100
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,210
I have five rows
from five edges,

101
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:12,260
and let me write down again
what this graph looks like.

102
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:19,720
OK, the first edge, edge one,
goes from node one to two.

103
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,140
So I'm going to put in a minus
one and a plus one in th- this

104
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,970
corresponds to node
one two three and four,

105
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,390
That's a basis for the null
space. the four columns.

106
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,000
The five rows correspond -- the
first row corresponds to edge

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,760
one.

108
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,410
Edge one leaves node one and
goes into node two, and that --

109
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,750
and it doesn't touch
three and four.

110
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:50,050
Edge two, edge two goes -- oh,
I haven't numbered these edges.

111
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,160
I just figured that was probably
edge one, but I didn't say so.

112
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,740
Let me take that to be edge one.

113
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,700
Let me take this to be edge two.

114
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,660
Let me take this
to be edge three.

115
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,990
This is edge four.

116
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,870
Ho, I'm discovering
-- no, wait a minute.

117
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,970
Did I number that twice?

118
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,750
Here's edge four.

119
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,980
And here's edge five.

120
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,480
All right.

121
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,980
OK?

122
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,780
So, so edge one, as I said,
goes from node one to two.

123
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,810
Edge two goes from two to
three, node two to three, so

124
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:30,420
minus one and one in the
second and third columns.

125
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,210
Edge three goes
from one to three.

126
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:39,220
I'm, I'm tempted to stop for a
moment with those three edges.

127
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,330
The null space is actually one
dimensional, and it's the line

128
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,400
Edges one two three,
those form what would we,

129
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,130
A basis for the
null space will be

130
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,250
just that.1 what do you call
the, the little, the little,

131
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,750
the subgraph formed by
edges one, two, and three?

132
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,680
That's a loop.

133
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,780
And the number of loops and
the position of the loops

134
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,230
will be crucial.

135
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:01,940
OK.

136
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,410
Actually, here's a
interesting point about loops.

137
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,480
If I look at those
rows, corresponding

138
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,150
to edges one two three,
and these guys made a loop.

139
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,640
You want to tell me --

140
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,900
if I just looked at
that much of the matrix

141
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,790
it would be natural
for me to ask,

142
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,320
are those rows independent?

143
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,270
Are the rows independent?

144
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,370
And can you tell from looking
at that if they are or are not

145
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,179
independent?

146
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:41,140
Do you see a, a relation
between those three rows?

147
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,030
Yes.

148
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:47,760
If I add that row to
that row, I get this row.

149
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,020
So, so that's like a hint
here that loops correspond

150
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,850
to dependent, linearly
dependent column --

151
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,540
linearly dependent give me
a basis for the null space.

152
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,040
rows.

153
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,290
OK, let me complete
the incidence matrix.

154
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:09,410
Number four, edge four is going
from node one to node four.

155
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,960
And the fifth edge is going
from node three to node four.

156
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,880
OK.

157
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
There's my matrix.

158
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,700
It came from the five
edges and the four nodes.

159
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:31,390
And if I had a big graph,
I'd have a big matrix.

160
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:37,800
And what questions do
I ask about matrices?

161
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,150
Can I ask --

162
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,484
here's the review now.

163
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:44,900
There's a matrix that comes
from somewhere. of all vectors

164
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,608
through that one.

165
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:48,500
If, if it was a big graph,
it would be a large matrix,

166
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,490
but a lot of zeros, right?

167
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,840
Because every row only
has two non-zeros.

168
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,680
So the number of -- it's
a very sparse matrix.

169
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,020
The number of non-zeros
is exactly two times

170
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,960
five, it's two m.

171
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,090
Every row only
has two non-zeros.

172
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,170
And that's with a
lot of structure.

173
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,350
And -- that was the point
I wanted to begin with,

174
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,570
that graphs, that real
graphs from real --

175
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,990
real matrices from genuine
problems have structure.

176
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,490
OK.

177
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,823
We can ask, and because of
the structure, we can answer,

178
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:31,410
If it -- yeah, let me
ask you just always,

179
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,570
the, the main questions
about matrices.

180
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,990
So first question, what
about the null space?

181
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,940
So what I asking if I ask you
for the null space of that

182
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,150
matrix?

183
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:47,590
I'm asking you if I'm looking
at the columns of the matrix,

184
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,710
four columns, and I'm asking
you, So there's a basis for it,

185
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,085
and here is the whole null
are those columns independent?

186
00:10:50,085 --> 00:11:02,470
If the columns are independent,
then what's in the null space?

187
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,650
Only the zero vector, right?

188
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:10,460
The null space contains --
tells us what combinations

189
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,040
of the columns -- it tells us
how to combine columns to get

190
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,540
zero.

191
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,400
Can -- and is there anything in
the null space of this matrix

192
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,320
other than just the zero vector?

193
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,679
In other words, are
those four columns

194
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,720
independent or dependent?

195
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,260
What else is in the null space?

196
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,020
OK.

197
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,390
That's our question.

198
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:40,070
Let me, I don't know
if you see the answer.

199
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,850
Whether there's -- so let's see.

200
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,780
I guess we could do it properly.

201
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,280
space.

202
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,890
We could solve Ax=0.

203
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:54,180
So let me solve Ax=0
to find the null space.

204
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,680
OK.

205
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,355
What's Ax?

206
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,200
Can I put x in here
in, in little letters?

207
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,960
x1, x2, x3, x4, that's
-- it's got four columns.

208
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,320
Ax now is that matrix times x.

209
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,530
And what do I get for Ax?

210
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,680
If the camera can keep that
matrix multiplication there,

211
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,040
I'll put the answer here.

212
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,350
Ax equal -- what's the
first component of Ax?

213
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,730
Can you take that first row,
minus one one zero zero,

214
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,180
and multiply by the x, and
of course you get x2-x1.

215
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,230
space.

216
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:41,370
The second row, I get x3-x2.

217
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:41,530
From the third row, I get x3-x1.

218
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,030
Any multiple of one one one
one, it's the whole line in four

219
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:56,990
From the fourth
row, I get x4-x1.

220
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,440
And from the fifth
row, I get x4-x3.

221
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,700
And I want to know
when is the thing zero.

222
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,170
This is my equation, Ax=0.

223
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,400
Notice what that
matrix A is doing,

224
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,350
what we've created a
matrix that computes

225
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,200
the differences across
every edge, the differences

226
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,090
in potential. differences are
zero, and that x is in the null

227
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,750
Let me even begin to
give this interpretation.

228
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:38,930
I'm going to think of this
vector x, which is x1 x2 x3 x4,

229
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,840
as the potentials at the nodes.

230
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,760
So I'm introducing a word,
potentials at the nodes.

231
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:57,600
And now if I multiply
by A, I get these --

232
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,635
I get these five components,
x2-x1, et cetera.

233
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,210
And what are they?

234
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,130
They're potential differences.

235
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,350
That's what A computes.

236
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,530
If I have potentials at the
nodes and I multiply by A,

237
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,520
it gives me the potential
differences, the differences

238
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,735
in potential, across the edges.

239
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,810
OK.

240
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,830
When are those
differences all zero?

241
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,310
So I'm looking for
the null space.

242
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,810
Of course, if all the (x)s
are zero then I get zero.

243
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,900
That, that just tells me,
of course, the zero vector

244
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,240
is in the null space.

245
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,870
But w- there's more
in the null space.

246
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,040
Those columns are -- of
A are dependent, right --

247
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,790
because I can find
solutions to that equation.

248
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,172
dimensional space.

249
00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:57,255
Tell me -- the null space.

250
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,010
Tell me one vector in the
null space, so tell me an x,

251
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:10,490
it's got four components,
and it makes that thing zero.

252
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,890
So what's a good x to do that?

253
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:22,000
One one one one,
constant potential.

254
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:52,130
If the potentials are constant,
then all the potential

255
00:15:52,130 --> 00:16:03,430
Do you see that
that's the null space?

256
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:12,260
So the, so the dimension of
the null space of A is one.

257
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,690
And there's a basis
for it, and there's

258
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,190
everything that's in it.

259
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,000
Good.

260
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,250
And what does that
mean physically?

261
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,240
I mean, what does that
mean in the application?

262
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,850
That guy in the null space.

263
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:33,170
It means that the
potentials can only

264
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,560
be determined up to a constant.

265
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Potential differences are
what make current flow.

266
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,970
That's what makes things happen.

267
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,140
It's these potential
differences that

268
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,320
will make something move
in the, in our network,

269
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,950
between x2- between
node two and node one.

270
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,650
Nothing will move if all
potentials are the same.

271
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,710
If all potentials are c, c, c,
and c, then nothing will move.

272
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:06,190
So we're, we have
this one parameter,

273
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:10,060
this arbitrary constant
that raises or drops

274
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,359
all the potentials.

275
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,339
It's like ranking
football teams, whatever.

276
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,510
We have a, there's a,
there's a constant --

277
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,540
or looking at
temperatures, you know,

278
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,770
there's a flow of heat from
higher temperature to lower

279
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,349
temperature.

280
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,840
If temperatures are
equal there's no flow,

281
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,700
and therefore we can measure --

282
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:36,950
we can measure temperatures
by, Celsius or we

283
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,050
can start at absolute zero.

284
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,000
And that arbitrary -- it's the
same arbitrary constant that,

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,660
that was there in calculus.

286
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,030
In calculus, right,
when you took

287
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,050
the integral, the indefinite
integral, there was a plus c,

288
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:58,030
and you had to set a starting
point to know what that c was.

289
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:02,370
So here what often happens is
we fix one of the potentials,

290
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,370
like the last one.

291
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:12,050
So a typical thing would
be to ground that node.

292
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:16,040
To set its potential at zero.

293
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,070
And if we do that, if
we fix that potential

294
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:25,570
so it's not unknown anymore,
then that column disappears

295
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,440
and we have three columns,
and those three columns

296
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,420
are independent.

297
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,630
So I'll leave the
column in there,

298
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,950
but we'll remember
that grounding a node

299
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,520
is the way to get it out.

300
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,680
And grounding a node is the
way to -- setting a node --

301
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,890
setting a potential to zero
tells us the, the base for all

302
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,510
potentials.

303
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,370
Then we can compute the others.

304
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,070
But what's the -- now
I've talked enough to ask

305
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,420
OK. what the rank
of the matrix is?

306
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,240
What's the rank then?

307
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,000
The rank of the matrix.

308
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,030
So we have a five
by four matrix.

309
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:11,680
We've located its null
space, one dimensional.

310
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,870
How many independent
columns do we have?

311
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,050
What's the rank?

312
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,880
It's three.

313
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,180
And the first three columns,
or actually any three columns,

314
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,920
will be independent.

315
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:28,800
Any three potentials are
independent, good variables.

316
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,490
The fourth potential
is not, we need to set,

317
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,160
and typically we
ground that node.

318
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,660
OK.

319
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,270
Rank is three.

320
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,820
Rank equals three.

321
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,200
OK.

322
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,420
Let's see, do I want to ask
you about the column space?

323
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,360
The column space is all
combinations of those columns.

324
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,560
I could say more
about it and I will.

325
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:01,870
Let me go to the null
space of A transpose,

326
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:07,680
because the equation A
transpose y equals zero

327
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,090
is probably the most
fundamental equation

328
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,410
of applied mathematics.

329
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,860
All right, let's
talk about that.

330
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,230
That deserves our attention.

331
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,590
A transpose y equals zero.

332
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:29,510
Let's -- let me put it on here.

333
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,991
So A transpose y equals zero.

334
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:33,490
OK.

335
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,360
So now I'm finding the
null space of A transpose.

336
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,200
Oh, and if I ask
you its dimension,

337
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,760
you could tell me what it is.

338
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,140
What's the dimension of the
null space of A transpose?

339
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,640
We now know enough to
answer that question.

340
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,030
What's the general formula for
the dimension of the null space

341
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,770
of A transpose?

342
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,560
A transpose, let me even
write out A transpose.

343
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:10,070
This A transpose will
be n by m, right?

344
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,770
In this case, it'll
be four by five.

345
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,960
n by m.

346
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,320
Those columns will become rows.

347
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:25,480
Minus one zero minus one minus
one zero is now the first row.

348
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,710
The second row of the matrix,
one minus one and three zeros.

349
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:36,210
The third column now becomes
the third row, zero one one

350
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,480
zero minus one.

351
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,905
And the fourth column
becomes the fourth row.

352
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,560
OK, good.

353
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,400
There's A transpose.

354
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:55,965
That multiplies y,
y1 y2 y3 y4 and y5.

355
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,410
OK.

356
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,830
Now you've had time to
think about this question.

357
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:09,370
What's the dimension of the
null space, if I set all those

358
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,705
-- wow.

359
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,960
Usually -- sometime
during this semester,

360
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,570
I'll drop one of these
erasers behind there.

361
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,880
That's a great moment.

362
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,570
There's no recovery.

363
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:29,390
There's -- centuries of
erasers are back there.

364
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:29,890
OK.

365
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,020
OK, what's the dimension
of the null space?

366
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,510
Give me the general
formula first

367
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:46,050
in terms of r and m and n.

368
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,580
This is like crucial, you --

369
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:54,200
we struggled to, to decide
what dimension meant,

370
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,980
and then we figured out
what it equaled for an m

371
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,850
by n matrix of rank r, and
the answer was m-r, right?

372
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:14,200
There are m=5 components,
m=5 columns of A transpose.

373
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,400
And r of those columns
are pivot columns,

374
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,960
because it'll have r pivots.

375
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,410
It has rank r.

376
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:28,090
And m-r are the free
ones now for A transpose,

377
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,060
so that's five minus
three, so that's two.

378
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,400
And I would like to
find this null space.

379
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,800
I know its dimension.

380
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,440
Now I want to find
out a basis for it.

381
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,780
And I want to understand
what this equation is.

382
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:53,500
So let me say what A transpose
y actually represents, why I'm

383
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,120
interested in that equation.

384
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:04,090
I'll put it down with those
old erasers and continue this.

385
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,430
Here's the great picture
of applied mathematics.

386
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,560
So let me complete that.

387
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,040
There's a matrix
that I'll call C

388
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,830
that connects potential
differences to currents.

389
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:21,840
So I'll call these -- these
are currents on the edges,

390
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,990
y1 y2 y3 y4 and y5.

391
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,340
Those are currents on the edges.

392
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,090
And this relation between
current and potential

393
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,820
difference is Ohm's Law.

394
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,340
This here is Ohm's Law.

395
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,300
Ohm's Law says that
the current on an edge

396
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:56,080
is some number times
the potential drop.

397
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,820
That's -- and that number is
the conductance of the edge,

398
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,290
one over the resistance.

399
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:08,850
This is the old current
is, is, the relation

400
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,960
of current, resistance,
and change in potential.

401
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,760
So it's a change in potential
that makes some current happen,

402
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,170
and it's Ohm's Law that says
how much current happens.

403
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:22,820
OK.

404
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,940
And then the final
step of this framework

405
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:31,070
is the equation A
transpose y equals zero.

406
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,990
And that's -- what
is that saying?

407
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,470
It has a famous name.

408
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:50,590
It's Kirchoff's Current Law,
KCL, Kirchoff's Current Law,

409
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,030
A transpose y equals zero.

410
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,950
So that when I'm solving, and
when I go back up with this

411
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:03,770
blackboard and solve A
transpose y equals zero,

412
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,950
it's this pattern of --

413
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,110
that I want you to see.

414
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,360
That we had rectangular
matrices, but --

415
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,070
and real applications, but in
those real applications comes A

416
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,500
and A transpose.

417
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,030
So our four subspaces are
exactly the right things

418
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,461
to know about.

419
00:26:23,461 --> 00:26:23,960
All right.

420
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,030
Let's know about that
null space of A transpose.

421
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,990
Wait a minute, where'd it go?

422
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,190
There it is.

423
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,680
OK.

424
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,720
OK.

425
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,210
Null space of A transpose.

426
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,070
We know what its
dimension should be.

427
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,670
Let's find out -- tell
me a vector in it.

428
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,150
Tell me -- now, so
what I asking you?

429
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,850
I'm asking you for
five currents that

430
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,320
satisfy Kirchoff's Current Law.

431
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,650
So we better understand
what that law says.

432
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,780
That, that law, A
transpose y equals

433
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:09,430
zero, what does that say, say
in the first row of A transpose?

434
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,100
That says -- the so the first
row of A transpose says minus

435
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:19,280
y1 minus y3 minus y4 is zero.

436
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,020
Where did that
equation come from?

437
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,470
Let me -- I'll redraw the graph.

438
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:31,600
Can I redraw the graph here,
so that we -- maybe here,

439
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,900
so that we see again --

440
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:39,470
there was node one,
node two, node three,

441
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,750
node four was off here.

442
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,310
That was, that was our graph.

443
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,220
We had currents on those.

444
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,650
We had a current y1 going there.

445
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,120
We had a current y --
what were the other,

446
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,900
what are those edge numbers?
y4 here and y3 here.

447
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,990
And then a y2 and a y5.

448
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,860
I'm, I'm just copying what
was on the other board

449
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,470
so it's ea-
convenient to see it.

450
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:15,260
What is this equation telling
me, this first equation

451
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,230
of Kirchoff's Current Law?

452
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,900
What does that mean
for that graph?

453
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:29,320
Well, I see y1, y3, and y4 as
the currents leaving node one.

454
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,930
So sure enough, the first
equation refers to node one,

455
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,720
and what does it say?

456
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,430
It says that the
net flow is zero.

457
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:43,230
That, that equation A transpose
y, Kirchoff's Current Law,

458
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,860
is a balance equation,
a conservation law.

459
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,770
Physicists, be overjoyed,
right, by this stuff.

460
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:56,520
It, it says that in equals out.

461
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,770
And in this case, the three
arrows are all going out,

462
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,070
so it says y1, y3,
and y4 add to zero.

463
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,280
Let's take the next one.

464
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:16,150
The second row is y1-y2, and
that's all that's in that row.

465
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,790
And that must have something
to do with node two.

466
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:25,780
And sure enough, it says y1=y2,
current in equals current out.

467
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:33,300
The third one, y2 plus
y3 minus y5 equals

468
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,200
zero.

469
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,340
That certainly will be
what's up at the third node.

470
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:43,350
y2 coming in, y3 coming in,
y5 going out has to balance.

471
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:48,770
And finally, y4
plus y5 equals zero

472
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:57,760
says that at this node, y4
plus y5, the total flow,

473
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,530
We don't -- you know, charge
doesn't accumulate at is zero.

474
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,000
the nodes.

475
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,180
It travels around.

476
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,030
OK.

477
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,940
Now give me --

478
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,580
I come back now to the
linear algebra question.

479
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:17,310
What's a vector y that
solves these equations?

480
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,860
Can I figure out
what the null space

481
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:28,470
is for this matrix, A transpose,
by looking at the graph?

482
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:33,070
I'm happy if I don't
have to do elimination.

483
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,780
I can do elimination,
we know how to do,

484
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,110
we know how to find
the null space basis.

485
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,580
We can do elimination
on this matrix,

486
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:48,150
and we'll get it into a good
reduced row echelon form,

487
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:51,330
and the special solutions
will pop right out.

488
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:56,040
But I would like to --
even to do it without that.

489
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,820
Let me just ask you first,
if I did elimination

490
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:06,780
on that, on that, matrix, what
would the last row become?

491
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,220
What would the last row -- if I
do elimination on that matrix,

492
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:16,380
the last row of R will
be all zeros, right?

493
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,190
Why?

494
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,770
Because the rank is three.

495
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,720
We only going to
have three pivots.

496
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,540
And the fourth row will be
all zeros when we eliminate.

497
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:32,020
So elimination will tell us
what, what we spotted earlier,

498
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:36,160
what's the null space -- all
the, all the information,

499
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,450
what are the dependencies.

500
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:42,790
We'll find those by elimination,
but here in a real example,

501
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,830
we can find them by thinking.

502
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,030
OK.

503
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:52,320
Again, my question is,
what is a solution y?

504
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,940
How could current travel
around this network

505
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:02,440
without collecting any
charge at the nodes?

506
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,650
Tell me a y.

507
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,540
OK.

508
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:12,650
So a basis for the null
space of A transpose.

509
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,980
How many vectors I looking for?

510
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,220
Two.

511
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,750
It's a two dimensional space.

512
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,350
My basis should have
two vectors in it.

513
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,570
Give me one.

514
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,750
One set of currents.

515
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,470
Suppose, let me start it.

516
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:31,801
Let me start with y1 as one.

517
00:32:31,801 --> 00:32:32,300
OK.

518
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:38,860
So one unit of -- one amp
travels on edge one with

519
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,120
the arrow.

520
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,480
OK, then what?

521
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,275
What is y2?

522
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,000
It's one also, right?

523
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,230
And of course what you did was
solve Kirchoff's Current Law

524
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,770
quickly in the second equation.

525
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,600
OK.

526
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,400
Now we've got one amp leaving
node one, coming around to node

527
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,900
three.

528
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,990
What shall we do now?

529
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,350
Well, what shall I take
for y3 in other words?

530
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,870
Oh, I've got a choice, but
why not make it what you said,

531
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,530
negative one.

532
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:16,150
So I have just sent current,
one amp, around that loop.

533
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,000
What shall y4 and
y5 be in this case?

534
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,050
We could take them to be zero.

535
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:31,410
This satisfies
Kirchoff's Current Law.

536
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:36,190
We could check it patiently,
that minus y1 minus y3

537
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,050
gives zero.

538
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,920
We know y1 is y2.

539
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,710
The others, y4 plus
y5 is certainly zero.

540
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,880
Any current around
a loop satisfies --

541
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,090
satisfies the Current Law.

542
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:52,140
Now you know how
to get another one.

543
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,150
OK.

544
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,890
Take current around this loop.

545
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:04,650
So now let y3 be one, y5 be
one, and y4 be minus one.

546
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:10,400
And so, so we have the first
basis vector sent current

547
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,260
around that loop, the
second basis vector

548
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,500
sends current around that

549
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,590
loop.

550
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,219
And I've -- and those
are independent,

551
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:23,980
and I've got two solutions --
two vectors in the null space

552
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,650
of A transpose, two solutions
to Kirchoff's Current Law.

553
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,590
Of course you would
say what about sending

554
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:34,830
current around the big loop.

555
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,889
What about that vector?

556
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:44,560
One for y1, one for y2,
nothing f- on y3, one for y5,

557
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,889
and minus one for y4.

558
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,690
What about that?

559
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,630
Is that, is that in the
null space of A transpose?

560
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,860
Sure.

561
00:34:53,860 --> 00:35:01,790
So why don't we now have a
third vector in the basis?

562
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,890
Because it's not
independent, right?

563
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,430
It's not independent.

564
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,910
This vector is the
sum of those two.

565
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:14,200
If I send current around
that and around that --

566
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,940
then on this edge y3 it's going
to cancel out and I'll have

567
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,080
altogether current around
the whole, the outside loop.

568
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,700
That's what this
one is, but it's

569
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,240
a combination of those two.

570
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,300
Do you see that I've now, I've
identified the null space of A

571
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,260
transpose --

572
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,640
but more than that, we've
solved Kirchoff's Current Law.

573
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:48,590
And understood it in
terms of the network.

574
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,180
OK.

575
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,010
So that's the null
space of A transpose.

576
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:58,030
I guess I -- there's always one
more space to ask you about.

577
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:04,370
Let's see, I guess I need the
row space of A, the column

578
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,440
space of A transpose.

579
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:14,240
So what's N, what's
its dimension?

580
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,800
Yup?

581
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,450
What's the dimension
of the row space of A?

582
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,672
If I look at the original
A, it had five rows.

583
00:36:21,672 --> 00:36:22,755
How many were independent?

584
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,620
Oh, I guess I'm asking
you the rank again, right?

585
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,490
And the answer is three, right?

586
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,610
Three independent rows.

587
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,760
When I transpose it, there's
three independent columns.

588
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,650
Are those columns
independent, those three?

589
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,620
The first three columns,
are they the pivot columns

590
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,720
of the matrix?

591
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,180
No.

592
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,450
Those three columns
are not independent.

593
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:56,000
There's a in fact, this tells
me a relation between them.

594
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,940
There's a vector in
the null space that

595
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,530
says the first column
plus the second column

596
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,400
equals the third column.

597
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,490
They're not independent
because they come from a loop.

598
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:11,570
So the pivot columns, the
pivot columns of this matrix

599
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:18,630
will be the first, the second,
not the third, but the fourth.

600
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:24,360
One, columns one,
two, and four are OK.

601
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,170
Where are they -- those are
the columns of A transpose,

602
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,350
those correspond to edges.

603
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:35,340
So there's edge one,
there's edge two,

604
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,600
and there's edge four.

605
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:46,930
So there's a -- that's like --

606
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,040
is a, smaller graph.

607
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,860
If I just look at the part
of the graph that I've, that

608
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,610
I've, thick -- used
with thick edges,

609
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,240
it has the same four nodes.

610
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,400
It only has three edges.

611
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,520
And the, those edges correspond
to the independent guys.

612
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,970
And in the graph there --
those three edges have no loop,

613
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,900
right?

614
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,550
The independent ones are the
ones that don't have a loop.

615
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,820
All the -- dependencies
came from loops.

616
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,800
They were the things in the
null space of A transpose.

617
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,140
If I take three
pivot columns, there

618
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,620
are no dependencies among
them, and they form a graph

619
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,630
without a loop, and I
just want to ask you

620
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,640
what's the name for a
graph without a loop?

621
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:43,590
So a graph without a loop is
-- has got not very many edges,

622
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,520
right?

623
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,180
I've got four nodes and
it only has three edges,

624
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,360
and if I put another edge
in, I would have a loop.

625
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,390
So it's this graph
with no loops,

626
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:01,670
and it's the one where the
rows of A are independent.

627
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,400
And what's a graph
called that has no loops?

628
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,810
It's called a tree.

629
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:11,980
So a tree is the name for
a graph with no loops.

630
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:24,400
And just to take
one last step here.

631
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,170
Using our formula for dimension.

632
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:33,710
Using our formula for
dimension, let's look --

633
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:41,370
once at this formula.

634
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:49,560
The dimension of the null
space of A transpose is m-r.

635
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,230
OK.

636
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:58,720
This is the number of loops,
number of independent loops.

637
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,300
m is the number of edges.

638
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,210
And what is r?

639
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,460
What is r for our -- we'll
have to remember way back.

640
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,970
The rank came -- from looking
at the columns of our matrix.

641
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,950
So what's the rank?

642
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,130
Let's just remember.

643
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:26,710
Rank was -- you remember
there was one --

644
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,750
we had a one dimensional
-- rank was n minus one,

645
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,690
that's what I'm
struggling to say.

646
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,810
Because there were n columns
coming from the n nodes,

647
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:45,030
so it's minus, the number
of nodes minus one,

648
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:50,070
because of that C, that
one one one one vector

649
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,920
in the null space.

650
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,210
The columns were
not independent.

651
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:58,190
There was one dependency,
so we needed n minus one.

652
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,610
This is a great formula.

653
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:06,230
This is like the
first shall I, --

654
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,410
write it slightly differently?

655
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:14,890
The number of edges --
let me put things --

656
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,940
have I got it right?

657
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,630
Number of edges is m, the
number -- r- is m-r, OK.

658
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,500
So, so I'm getting --

659
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,070
let me put the number of
nodes on the other side.

660
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,130
So I -- the number of nodes --

661
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,890
I'll move that to
the other side --

662
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:46,320
minus the number of edges
plus the number of loops is --

663
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,060
I have minus, minus one is one.

664
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,190
The number of nodes
minus the number

665
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:56,030
of edges plus the
number of loops is one.

666
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,460
These are like zero
dimensional guys.

667
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,230
They're the points on the graph.

668
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,570
The edges are like one
dimensional things,

669
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:06,480
they're, they connect nodes.

670
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,420
The loops are like two
dimensional things.

671
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,240
They have, like, an area.

672
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,030
And this count works
for every graph.

673
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:22,950
And it's known as
Euler's Formula.

674
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,770
We see Euler again,
that guy never stopped.

675
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,940
OK.

676
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:33,400
And can we just check
-- so what I saying?

677
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,340
I'm saying that linear algebra
proves Euler's Formula.

678
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:43,650
Euler's Formula is this great
topology fact about any graph.

679
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,660
I'll draw, let me
draw another graph,

680
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:51,980
let me draw a graph with
more edges and loops.

681
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,610
Let me put in lots of --

682
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,530
OK.

683
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,500
I just drew a graph there.

684
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,990
So what are the, what are the
quantities in that formula?

685
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,870
How many nodes have I got?

686
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,630
Looks like five.

687
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,730
How many edges have I got?

688
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:10,700
One two three four
five six seven.

689
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,150
How many loops have I got?

690
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,010
One two three.

691
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:19,810
And Euler's right,
I always get one.

692
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:27,700
That, this formula, is extremely
useful in understanding

693
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,560
the relation of these quantities
-- the number of nodes,

694
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,780
the number of edges,
and the number of loops.

695
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,970
OK.

696
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,890
Just complete this
lecture by completing

697
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,310
this picture, this cycle.

698
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:45,320
So let me come to the --

699
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:57,200
so this expresses the
equations of applied math.

700
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,800
This, let me call these
potential differences,

701
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,100
say, E. So E is A x.

702
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,010
That's the equation
for this step.

703
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,890
The currents come from
the potential differences.

704
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,020
y is C E.

705
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:20,230
The potential -- the currents
satisfy Kirchoff's Current Law.

706
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:23,230
Those are the equations of --

707
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,290
with no source terms.

708
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:32,590
Those are the equations of
electrical circuits of many --

709
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:37,940
those are like the, the
most basic three equations.

710
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,110
Applied math comes
in this structure.

711
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:43,690
The only thing I haven't
got yet in the picture

712
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:49,260
is an outside source to
make something happen.

713
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,650
I could add a
current source here,

714
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,610
I could, I could add
external currents

715
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,370
going in and out of nodes.

716
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,790
I could add batteries
in the edges.

717
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,530
Those are two ways.

718
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,860
If I add batteries in the edges,
they, they come into here.

719
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,650
Let me add current sources.

720
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:13,160
If I add current sources,
those come in here.

721
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,030
So there's a, there's
where current sources go,

722
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:22,160
because the F is a like a
current coming from outside.

723
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,080
So we have our edges,
we have our graph,

724
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:33,370
and then I send one amp into
this node and out of this node

725
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:36,970
-- and that gives
me, a right-hand side

726
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,840
in Kirchoff's Current Law.

727
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,290
And can I -- to
complete the lecture,

728
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:45,420
I'm just going to put these
three equations together.

729
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,240
So I start with x, my unknown.

730
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,350
I multiply by A.

731
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,520
That gives me the
potential differences.

732
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,100
That was our matrix A that
the whole thing started with.

733
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,720
I multiply by C.

734
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,280
Those are the physical
constants in Ohm's Law.

735
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,500
Now I have y.

736
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:12,270
I multiply y by A
transpose, and now I have F.

737
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,660
So there is the whole thing.

738
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:22,870
There's the basic
equation of applied math.

739
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:28,700
Coming from these three steps,
in which the last step is

740
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,140
this balance equation.

741
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,560
There's always a balance
equation to look for.

742
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,880
These are the --

743
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,350
when I say the most basic
equations of applied

744
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:37,980
mathematics --

745
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:41,500
I should say, in equilibrium.

746
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,820
Time isn't in this problem.

747
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:47,800
I'm not -- and Newton's
Law isn't acting here.

748
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,230
I'm, I'm looking at the --
equations when everything has

749
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,110
settled down, how do
the currents distribute

750
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,780
in the network.

751
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:00,480
And of course there are
big codes to solve the --

752
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,860
this is the basic problem
of numerical linear algebra

753
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,190
for systems of equations,
because that's how they come.

754
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:13,320
And my final question.

755
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,940
What can you tell me about
this matrix A transpose C A?

756
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,400
Or even A transpose A?

757
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,310
I'll just close
with that question.

758
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:28,280
What do you know about
the matrix A transpose A?

759
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,400
It is always symmetric, right.

760
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,350
OK, thank.

761
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:38,590
So I'll see you Wednesday for a
full review of these chapters,

762
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,230
and Friday you get to tell me.

763
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,780
Thanks.
