1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,730
I've been multiplying
matrices already,

2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,640
but certainly time for
me to discuss the rules

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,390
for matrix multiplication.

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,980
And the interesting part is
the many ways you can do it,

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,970
and they all give
the same answer.

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,780
And they're all important.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,840
So matrix multiplication,
and then, come inverses.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,520
So we mentioned the
inverse of a matrix.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,660
That's a big deal.

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,400
Lots to do about inverses
and how to find them.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,420
Okay, so I'll begin with how
to multiply two matrices.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:57,330
First way, okay, so suppose
I have a matrix A multiplying

13
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,500
a matrix B and --
giving me a result --

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,990
well, I could call it C.

15
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,870
A times B.

16
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,340
Okay.

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:18,360
So, let me just review
the rule for this entry.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,000
That's the entry in
row i and column j.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,340
So that's the i j entry.

20
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,350
Right there is C i j.

21
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,900
We always write the row number
and then the column number.

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,670
So I might --

23
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,370
I might -- maybe I take it C
3 4, just to make it specific.

24
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,700
So instead of i j,
let me use numbers.

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,290
C 3 4.

26
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,210
So where does that come
from, the three four entry?

27
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:53,750
It comes from row three, here,
row three and column four,

28
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,620
as you know.

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,710
Column four.

30
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,750
And can I just write
down, or can we

31
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:05,430
write down the formula for it?

32
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,539
If we look at the whole
row and the whole column,

33
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:15,240
the quick way for me to
say it is row three of A --

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,470
I could use a dot
for dot product.

35
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,740
I won't often use
that, actually.

36
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,790
Dot column four of B.

37
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,370
But this gives us a
chance to just, like,

38
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,460
use a little matrix notation.

39
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,500
What are the entries?

40
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,440
What's this first
entry in row three?

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,160
That number that's
sitting right there is...

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,690
A, so it's got two
indices and what are they?

43
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,550
3 1.

44
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,540
So there's an a 3 1 there.

45
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,120
Now what's the first guy
at the top of column four?

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,430
So what's sitting up there?

47
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,970
B 1 4, right.

48
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:09,670
So that this dot product
starts with A 3 1 times B 1 4.

49
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,870
And then what's the next -- so
this is like I'm accumulating

50
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:20,710
this sum, then comes the next
guy, A 3 2, second column,

51
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,270
times B 2 4, second row.

52
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:31,120
So it's b A 3 2,
B 2 4 and so on.

53
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,060
Just practice with indices.

54
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,100
Oh, let me even practice
with a summation formula.

55
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,890
So this is --

56
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,910
most of the course,
I use whole vectors.

57
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,680
I very seldom, get
down to the details

58
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,070
of these particular entries,
but here we'd better do it.

59
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,710
So it's some kind
of a sum, right?

60
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:03,930
Of things in row three,
column K shall I say?

61
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,670
Times things in
row K, column four.

62
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,680
Do you see that that's
what we're seeing here?

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,470
This is K is one, here
K is two, on along --

64
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,070
so the sum goes all the
way along the row and down

65
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,640
the column, say, one to N.

66
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,990
So that's what the C three
four entry looks like.

67
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,280
A sum of a three K b K four.

68
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,500
Just takes a little
practice to do that.

69
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,220
Okay.

70
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,540
And -- well, maybe
I should say --

71
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,480
when are we allowed to
multiply these matrices?

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,160
What are the shapes
of these things?

73
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,100
The shapes are --

74
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,895
if we allow them to be not
necessarily square matrices.

75
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,770
If they're square,
they've got to be the same

76
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,850
size.

77
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,580
If they're rectangular,
they're not the same size.

78
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,560
If they're rectangular,
this might be -- well,

79
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,490
I always think of A as m by n.

80
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,460
m rows, n columns.

81
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,500
So that sum goes to n.

82
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,220
Now what's the point -- how
many rows does B have to have?

83
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,780
n.

84
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,930
The number of rows in
B, the number of guys

85
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,710
that we meet coming down has
to match the number of ones

86
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,610
across.

87
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,750
So B will have to
be n by something.

88
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,360
Whatever.

89
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:39,760
P. So the number of columns here
has to match the number of rows

90
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,610
there, and then
what's the result?

91
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,580
What's the shape of the result?

92
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,770
What's the shape
of C, the output?

93
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,410
Well, it's got these same
m rows -- it's got m rows.

94
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,000
And how many columns?

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,560
P. m by P. Okay.

96
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,610
So there are m times P little
numbers in there, entries,

97
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,750
and each one, looks like that.

98
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,850
Okay.

99
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,990
So that's the standard rule.

100
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,765
That's the way people think
of multiplying matrices.

101
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,810
I do it too.

102
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,990
But I want to talk
about other ways

103
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,540
to look at that
same calculation,

104
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:30,170
looking at whole
columns and whole rows.

105
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,890
Okay.

106
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,030
So can I do A B C again?

107
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,670
A B equaling C again?

108
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,490
But now, tell me about...

109
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,040
I'll put it up here.

110
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:58,560
So here goes A, again,
times B producing C.

111
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,560
And again, this is m by n.

112
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,520
This is n by P and
this is m by P. Okay.

113
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,290
Now I want to look
at whole columns.

114
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,590
I want to look at
the columns of --

115
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,480
here's the second way
to multiply matrices.

116
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,450
Because I'm going to build
on what I know already.

117
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,150
How do I multiply a
matrix by a column?

118
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,500
I know how to multiply
this matrix by that column.

119
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,250
Shall I call that column one?

120
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,430
That tells me column
one of the answer.

121
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,890
The matrix times the first
column is that first column.

122
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,140
Because none of
this stuff entered

123
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,910
that part of the answer.

124
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,550
The matrix times
the second column

125
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,770
is the second column
of the answer.

126
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,780
Do you see what I'm saying?

127
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,270
That I could think of
multiplying a matrix

128
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,470
by a vector, which I
already knew how to do,

129
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:08,860
and I can think of just P
columns sitting side by side,

130
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,000
just like resting
next to each other.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,800
And I multiply A times
each one of those.

132
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,650
And I get the P
columns of the answer.

133
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,970
Do you see this as --
this is quite nice,

134
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:27,980
to be able to think, okay,
matrix multiplication works

135
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,710
so that I can just think
of having several columns,

136
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,090
multiplying by A and getting
the columns of the answer.

137
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:43,169
So, like, here's column one
shall I call that column one?

138
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,540
And what's going in there
is A times column one.

139
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,680
Okay.

140
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,220
So that's the picture
a column at a time.

141
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,700
So what does that tell me?

142
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,400
What does that tell me
about these columns?

143
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:09,580
These columns of C
are combinations,

144
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:23,410
because we've seen that
before, of columns of A.

145
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,890
Every one of these
comes from A times this,

146
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,720
and A times a vector
is a combination

147
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,390
of the columns of A.

148
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:40,640
And it makes sense, because
the columns of A have length m

149
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,380
and the columns of
C have length m.

150
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,260
And every column of
C is some combination

151
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,440
of the columns of A.

152
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,410
And it's these
numbers in here that

153
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,670
tell me what combination it is.

154
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,760
Do you see that?

155
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,970
That in that answer, C,
I'm seeing stuff that's

156
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,740
combinations of these columns.

157
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,390
Now, suppose I look at it
-- that's two ways now.

158
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,950
The third way is
look at it by rows.

159
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,420
So now let me change to rows.

160
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,590
Okay.

161
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:23,320
So now I can think
of a row of A --

162
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,210
a row of A multiplying all these
rows here and producing a row

163
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,210
of the product.

164
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,160
So this row takes a
combination of these rows

165
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,840
and that's the answer.

166
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:50,680
So these rows of C are
combinations of what?

167
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,870
Tell me how to finish that.

168
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:01,000
The rows of C, when I have a
matrix B, it's got its rows

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,840
and I multiply by A,
and what does that do?

170
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,750
It mixes the rows up.

171
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:13,660
It creates combinations
of the rows of B, thanks.

172
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,730
Rows of B.

173
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:24,990
That's what I wanted to
see, that this answer --

174
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,820
I can see where the
pieces are coming from.

175
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,330
The rows in the answer are
coming as combinations of these

176
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,090
rows.

177
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:37,020
The columns in the answer are
coming as combinations of those

178
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,750
columns.

179
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,920
And so that's three ways.

180
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,620
Now you can say, okay,
what's the fourth way?

181
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,450
The fourth way --

182
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,440
so that's -- now we've
got, like, the regular way,

183
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,360
the column way,
the row way and --

184
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,680
what's left?

185
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,450
The one that I can --

186
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:12,110
well, one way is
columns times rows.

187
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,940
What happens if I multiply --

188
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,480
So this was row times
column, it gave a number.

189
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:21,980
Okay.

190
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,670
Now I want to ask you
about column times row.

191
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:37,610
If I multiply a column
of A times a row of B,

192
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,460
what shape I ending up with?

193
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,380
So if I take a
column times a row,

194
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,710
that's definitely different from
taking a row times a column.

195
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,730
So a column of A was -- what's
the shape of a column of A?

196
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,640
m by one.

197
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,430
A column of A is a column.

198
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:03,190
It's got m entries
and one column.

199
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,780
And what's a row of B?

200
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:10,000
It's got one row and P columns.

201
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,870
So what's the shape -- what do
I get if I multiply a column

202
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,590
by a row?

203
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,170
I get a big matrix.

204
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,540
I get a full-sized matrix.

205
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,790
If I multiply a
column by a row --

206
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,090
should we just do one?

207
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:34,470
Let me take the column two three
four times the row one six.

208
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,825
That product there --

209
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:42,950
I mean, when I'm just
following the rules of matrix

210
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,490
multiplication, those rules
are just looking like --

211
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,570
kind of petite, kind of
small, because the rows here

212
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,830
are so short and the
columns there are so short,

213
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,610
but they're the same
length, one entry.

214
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,530
So what's the answer?

215
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,770
What's the answer if I do two
three four times one six, just

216
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,320
for practice?

217
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,180
Well, what's the first
row of the answer?

218
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,030
Two twelve.

219
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:16,420
And the second row of the
answer is three eighteen.

220
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:24,220
And the third row of the
answer is four twenty four.

221
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,400
That's a very special
matrix, there.

222
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,840
Very special matrix.

223
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,830
What can you tell me
about its columns,

224
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,220
the columns of that matrix?

225
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,410
They're multiples
of this guy, right?

226
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,690
They're multiples of that one.

227
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,340
Which follows our rule.

228
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,540
We said that the columns of
the answer were combinations,

229
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,300
but there's only -- to take
a combination of one guy,

230
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
it's just a multiple.

231
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,000
The rows of the
answer, what can you

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,530
tell me about those three rows?

233
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,480
They're all multiples
of this row.

234
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,660
They're all multiples of
one six, as we expected.

235
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,970
But I'm getting a
full-sized matrix.

236
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:15,800
And now, just to complete
this thought, if I have --

237
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,280
let me write down
the fourth way.

238
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:35,630
A B is a sum of columns
of A times rows of B.

239
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,680
So that, for example, if my
matrix was two three four

240
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,450
and then had another column,
say, seven eight nine,

241
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:53,010
and my matrix here has -- say,
started with one six and then

242
00:15:53,010 --> 00:16:00,890
had another column
like zero zero, then --

243
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,630
here's the fourth way, okay?

244
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,690
I've got two columns there,
I've got two rows there.

245
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,920
So the beautiful rule is --

246
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,080
see, the whole thing
by columns and rows

247
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:19,730
is that I can take the first
column times the first row

248
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,100
and add the second column
times the second row.

249
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,790
So that's the fourth way --

250
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,760
that I can take
columns times rows,

251
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,800
first column times first row,
second column times second

252
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,960
row and add.

253
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,110
Actually, what will I get?

254
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,765
What will the answer be for
that matrix multiplication?

255
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,130
Well, this one it's just
going to give us zero,

256
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:56,070
so in fact I'm back to
this -- that's the answer,

257
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,310
for that matrix multiplication.

258
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:05,569
I'm happy to put up here
these facts about matrix

259
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:10,040
multiplication, because it
gives me a chance to write down

260
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,099
special matrices like this.

261
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,050
This is a special matrix.

262
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,569
All those rows lie
on the same line.

263
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,900
All those rows lie on
the line through one six.

264
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,240
If I draw a picture of
all these row vectors,

265
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,119
they're all the same direction.

266
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,730
If I draw a picture of
these two column vectors,

267
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,900
they're in the same direction.

268
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,430
Later, I would
use this language.

269
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,310
Not too much later, either.

270
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,400
I would say the
row space, which is

271
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,380
like all the
combinations of the rows,

272
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,060
is just a line for this matrix.

273
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,240
The row space is the line
through the vector one six.

274
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,390
All the rows lie on that line.

275
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,710
And the column space
is also a line.

276
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,510
All the columns lie on the
line through the vector two

277
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,950
three four.

278
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,340
So this is like a
really minimal matrix.

279
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,940
And it's because of these ones.

280
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,440
Okay.

281
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:18,580
So that's a third way.

282
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,160
Now I want to say one more thing
about matrix multiplication

283
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,100
while we're on the subject.

284
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,060
And it's this.

285
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,740
You could also multiply --

286
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,390
You could also cut
the matrix into blocks

287
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,160
and do the
multiplication by blocks.

288
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:46,690
Yet that's actually so, useful
that I want to mention it.

289
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,745
Block multiplication.

290
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,500
So I could take my matrix A
and I could chop it up, like,

291
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,460
maybe just for simplicity,
let me chop it into two --

292
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,770
into four square blocks.

293
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,980
Suppose it's square.

294
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,990
Let's just take a nice case.

295
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,800
And B, suppose it's
square also, same size.

296
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,460
So these sizes don't
have to be the same.

297
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,540
What they have to do
is match properly.

298
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,590
Here they certainly will match.

299
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,340
So here's the rule for
block multiplication,

300
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:28,880
that if this has
blocks like, A --

301
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,220
so maybe A1, A2, A3,
A4 are the blocks here,

302
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,210
and these blocks
are B1, B2,3 and B4?

303
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:44,770
Then the answer
I can find block.

304
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,500
And if you tell me
what's in that block,

305
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,560
then I'm going to be quiet
about matrix multiplication

306
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,870
for the rest of the day.

307
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,920
What goes into that block?

308
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,870
You see, these might be
-- this matrix might be --

309
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,400
these matrices might be, like,
twenty by twenty with blocks

310
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,030
that are ten by ten, to take the
easy case where all the blocks

311
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,940
are the same shape.

312
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,110
And the point is that I could
multiply those by blocks.

313
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,940
And what goes in here?

314
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,920
What's that block in the answer?

315
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,710
A1 B1, that's a
matrix times a matrix,

316
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,270
it's the right size, ten by ten.

317
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,610
Any more?

318
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:36,760
Plus, what else goes in there?

319
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,160
A2 B3, right?

320
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,490
It's just like block
rows times block columns.

321
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,070
Nobody, I think, not even
Gauss could see instantly

322
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,040
that it works.

323
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,130
But somehow, if we check
it through, all five ways

324
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,020
we're doing the same
multiplications.

325
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,430
So this familiar
multiplication is

326
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,270
what we're really
doing when we do it

327
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:10,240
by columns, by rows by columns
times rows and by blocks.

328
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,740
Okay.

329
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,680
I just have to, like,
get the rules straight

330
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,991
for matrix multiplication.

331
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:17,490
Okay.

332
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,490
All right, I'm ready
for the second topic,

333
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,590
which is inverses.

334
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,479
Okay.

335
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:29,270
Ready for inverses.

336
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,040
And let me do it for
square matrices first.

337
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:44,770
Okay.

338
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:52,270
So I've got a square matrix A.

339
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,370
And it may or may not
have an inverse, right?

340
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,260
Not all matrices have inverses.

341
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,770
In fact, that's the most
important question you can ask

342
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:06,260
about the matrix, is if it's
-- if you know it's square,

343
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,540
is it invertible or not?

344
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,500
If it is invertible, then
there is some other matrix,

345
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,680
shall I call it A inverse?

346
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,600
And what's the -- if
A inverse exists --

347
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,270
there's a big "if" here.

348
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:34,120
If this matrix exists, and it'll
be really central to figure out

349
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,940
when does it exist?

350
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,350
And then if it does exist,
how would you find it?

351
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,710
But what's the equation
here that I haven't --

352
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,900
that I have to finish now?

353
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:53,280
This matrix, if it exists
multiplies A and produces,

354
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,755
I think, the identity.

355
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,680
But a real --

356
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,600
an inverse for a square matrix
could be on the right as well

357
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,240
--

358
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:25,760
this is true, too, that it's --

359
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,280
if I have a -- yeah in
fact, this is not --

360
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,570
this is probably the --

361
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:38,400
this is something that's not
easy to prove, but it works.

362
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,240
That a left --

363
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,670
square matrices, a left
inverse is also a right

364
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,570
inverse.

365
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,090
If I can find a matrix on the
left that gets the identity,

366
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,990
then also that
matrix on the right

367
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,630
will produce that identity.

368
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,310
For rectangular matrices,
we'll see a left inverse

369
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,950
that isn't a right inverse.

370
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,660
In fact, the shapes
wouldn't allow it.

371
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,700
But for square
matrices, the shapes

372
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:09,820
allow it and it happens,
if A has an inverse.

373
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,011
Okay, so give me some cases --

374
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:14,510
let's see.

375
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,090
I hate to be negative
here, but let's talk

376
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,070
about the case with no inverse.

377
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:31,210
So -- these matrices are called
invertible or non-singular --

378
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,960
those are the good ones.

379
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,510
And we want to be able
to identify how --

380
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,180
if we're given a matrix,
has it got an inverse?

381
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,950
Can I talk about
the singular case?

382
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:52,940
No inverse.

383
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,950
All right.

384
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,720
Best to start with an example.

385
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,880
Tell me an example -- let's
get an example up here.

386
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,030
Let's make it two by two --

387
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:13,540
of a matrix that has
not got an inverse.

388
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,160
And let's see why.

389
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,230
Let me write one up.

390
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,950
No inverse.

391
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,620
Let's see why.

392
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:30,780
Let me write up --
one three two six.

393
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,820
Why does that matrix
have no inverse?

394
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,245
You could answer
that various ways.

395
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,390
Give me one reason.

396
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:51,620
Well, you could -- if you
know about determinants,

397
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:57,060
which you're not supposed to,
you could take its determinant

398
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,740
and you would get --

399
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,330
Zero.

400
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,090
Okay.

401
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,120
Now -- all right.

402
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,330
Let me ask you other reasons.

403
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,120
I mean, as for other
reasons that that matrix

404
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,810
isn't invertible.

405
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,765
Here, I could use
what I'm saying here.

406
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,800
Suppose A times other
matrix gave the identity.

407
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,750
Why is that not possible?

408
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,010
Because -- oh, yeah --

409
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,220
I'm thinking about columns here.

410
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,200
If I multiply this matrix A by
some other matrix, then the --

411
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,240
the result -- what can you
tell me about the columns?

412
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,730
They're all multiples
of those columns, right?

413
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,340
If I multiply A by
another matrix that --

414
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:04,130
the product has columns that
come from those columns.

415
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,480
So can I get the
identity matrix?

416
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,120
No way.

417
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,670
The columns of the identity
matrix, like one zero --

418
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,740
it's not a combination
of those columns,

419
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,520
because those two
columns lie on the --

420
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,140
both lie on the same line.

421
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,140
Every combination is just
going to be on that line

422
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,480
and I can't get one zero.

423
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:33,530
So, do you see that sort of
column picture of the matrix

424
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,750
not being invertible.

425
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,580
In fact, here's another reason.

426
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,720
This is even a more
important reason.

427
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,260
Well, how can I
say more important?

428
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,810
All those are important.

429
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,910
This is another way to see it.

430
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,410
A matrix has no inverse --

431
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,710
yeah -- here -- now
this is important.

432
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,180
A matrix has no -- a square
matrix won't have an inverse

433
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:07,980
if there's no inverse
because I can solve --

434
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:20,810
I can find an X of -- a
vector X with A times --

435
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:23,140
this A times X giving zero.

436
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:31,310
This is the reason I like best.

437
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,170
That matrix won't
have an inverse.

438
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:40,490
Can you -- well, let
me change I to U.

439
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:46,780
So tell me a vector X that,
solves A X equals zero.

440
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,610
I mean, this is, like,
the key equation.

441
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,310
In mathematics, all
the key equations

442
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,490
have zero on the
right-hand side.

443
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,490
So what's the X?

444
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:58,290
Tell me an X here --

445
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,360
so now I'm going to put --
slip in the X that you tell me

446
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,500
and I'm going to get zero.

447
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,000
What X would do that job?

448
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,370
Three and negative one?

449
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,610
Is that the one you
picked, or -- yeah.

450
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,720
Or another -- well, if
you picked zero with zero,

451
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,060
I'm not so excited, right?

452
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,490
Because that would always work.

453
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,550
So it's really the
fact that this vector

454
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,840
isn't zero that's important.

455
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,750
It's a non-zero vector and
three negative one would do it.

456
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,130
That just says three of this
column minus one of that column

457
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,861
is the zero column.

458
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:39,360
Okay.

459
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,860
So now I know that A
couldn't be invertible.

460
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,890
But what's the reasoning?

461
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,720
If A X is zero, suppose I
multiplied by A inverse.

462
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,660
Yeah, well here's the reason.

463
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:02,180
Here -- this is why this
spells disaster for an inverse.

464
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,580
The matrix can't have an
inverse if some combination

465
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,140
of the columns gives
z- it gives nothing.

466
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,630
Because, I could
take A X equals zero,

467
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:21,200
I could multiply by A inverse
and what would I discover?

468
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,840
Suppose I take that equation
and I multiply by --

469
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,860
if A inverse existed, which
of course I'm going to come

470
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,560
to the conclusion it can't
because if it existed,

471
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,570
if there was an A inverse
to this dopey matrix,

472
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,990
I would multiply that equation
by that inverse and I would

473
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:42,270
discover X is zero.

474
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:45,320
If I multiply A by A inverse
on the left, I get X.

475
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,830
If I multiply by A inverse
on the right, I get zero.

476
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,790
So I would discover X was zero.

477
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,050
But it -- X is not zero.

478
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,800
X -- this guy wasn't zero.

479
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,460
There it is.

480
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,170
It's three minus one.

481
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:06,250
So, conclusion -- only, it takes
us some time to really work

482
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,040
with that conclusion --

483
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:14,300
our conclusion will be that
non-invertible matrices,

484
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:19,490
singular matrices, some
combinations of their columns

485
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,290
gives the zero column.

486
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:26,090
They they take some
vector X into zero.

487
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:30,650
And there's no way A
inverse can recover, right?

488
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,520
That's what this equation says.

489
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,980
This equation says I take
this vector X and multiplying

490
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,470
by A gives zero.

491
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,220
But then when I
multiply by A inverse,

492
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,690
I can never escape from zero.

493
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,980
So there couldn't
be an A inverse.

494
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,701
Where here -- okay, now fix --

495
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,200
all right.

496
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Now let me take -- all right,
back to the positive side.

497
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,530
Let's take a matrix that
does have an inverse.

498
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,840
And why not invert it?

499
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,500
Okay.

500
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,782
Can I -- so let me take on
this third board a matrix --

501
00:32:08,782 --> 00:32:09,990
shall I fix that up a little?

502
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:15,660
Tell me a matrix that
has got an inverse.

503
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,930
Well, let me say one three
two -- what shall I put there?

504
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,665
Well, don't put six,
I guess is -- right?

505
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,000
Do I any favorites here?

506
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,910
One?

507
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,280
Or eight?

508
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,140
I don't care.

509
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,450
What, seven?

510
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:43,950
Seven.

511
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,540
Okay.

512
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,060
Seven is a lucky number.

513
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,750
All right, seven, okay.

514
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,380
Okay.

515
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,080
So -- now what's our idea?

516
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,740
We believe that this
matrix is invertible.

517
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,060
Those who like determinants have
quickly taken its determinant

518
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,320
and found it wasn't zero.

519
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,610
Those who like columns,
and probably that --

520
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:08,450
that department is not
totally popular yet --

521
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,080
but those who like columns
will look at those two columns

522
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,090
and say, hey, they point
in different directions.

523
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,080
So I can get anything.

524
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,860
Now, let me see, what do I mean?

525
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,880
How I going to
computer A inverse?

526
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,060
So A inverse --

527
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,360
here's A inverse, now,
and I have to find it.

528
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,219
And what do I get when I
do this multiplication?

529
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:33,760
The identity.

530
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,940
You know, forgive me for
taking two by two-s, but --

531
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:49,240
lt's good to keep the
computations manageable and let

532
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,090
the ideas come out.

533
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:55,230
Okay, now what's
the idea I want?

534
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,520
I'm looking for this
matrix A inverse, how

535
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,750
I going to find it?

536
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:04,235
Right now, I've got
four numbers to find.

537
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,159
I'm going to look
at the first column.

538
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,860
Let me take this
first column, A B.

539
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,699
What's up there?

540
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,670
What -- tell me this.

541
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:25,260
What equation does the
first column satisfy?

542
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,489
The first column satisfies A
times that column is one zero.

543
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:34,179
The first column of the answer.

544
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:38,820
And the second column,
C D, satisfies A times

545
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,139
that second column is zero one.

546
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:48,909
You see that finding the inverse
is like solving two systems.

547
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:52,210
One system, when the
right-hand side is one zero --

548
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,139
I'm just going to split
it into two pieces.

549
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:58,760
I don't even need to rewrite it.

550
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:04,480
I can take A times --
so let me put it here.

551
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:18,100
A times column j of A inverse
is column j of the identity.

552
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,010
I've got n equations.

553
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,500
I've got, well,
two in this case.

554
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,100
And they have the
same matrix, A,

555
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,860
but they have different
right-hand sides.

556
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,840
The right-hand sides
are just the columns

557
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,800
of the identity, this
guy and this guy.

558
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,450
And these are the two solutions.

559
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,610
Do you see what I'm going --

560
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:45,120
I'm looking at that
equation by columns.

561
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,050
I'm looking at A
times this column,

562
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,910
giving that guy, and A times
that column giving that guy.

563
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:55,500
So -- Essentially -- so
this is like the Gauss --

564
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,410
we're back to Gauss.

565
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,820
We're back to solving systems of
equations, but we're solving --

566
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,160
we've got two right-hand
sides instead of one.

567
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,010
That's where Jordan comes in.

568
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,980
So at the very beginning
of the lecture,

569
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,230
I mentioned Gauss-Jordan,
let me write it up again.

570
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:13,730
Okay.

571
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,630
Here's the Gauss-Jordan idea.

572
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:35,000
Gauss-Jordan solve
two equations at once.

573
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:39,960
Okay.

574
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,630
Let me show you how
the mechanics go.

575
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:48,970
How do I solve a
single equation?

576
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:55,760
So the two equations
are one three two seven,

577
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,630
multiplying A B gives one zero.

578
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,560
And the other
equation is the same

579
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:12,130
one three two seven
multiplying C D gives zero one.

580
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,010
Okay.

581
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,410
That'll tell me the two
columns of the inverse.

582
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,080
I'll have inverse.

583
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,940
In other words, if I can
solve with this matrix A,

584
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,850
if I can solve with
that right-hand side

585
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:28,340
and that right-hand
side, I'm invertible.

586
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,460
I've got it.

587
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,690
Okay.

588
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:36,410
And Jordan sort of said to
Gauss, solve them together,

589
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,650
look at the matrix -- if
we just solve this one,

590
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:43,140
I would look at one
three two seven,

591
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,030
and how do I deal with
the right-hand side?

592
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,960
I stick it on as an
extra column, right?

593
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,460
That's this augmented matrix.

594
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,750
That's the matrix when I'm
watching the right-hand side

595
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,470
at the same time, doing the
same thing to the right side

596
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,520
that I do to the left?

597
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,610
So I just carry it along
as an extra column.

598
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,100
Now I'm going to carry
along two extra columns.

599
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,920
And I'm going to do
whatever Gauss wants, right?

600
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,150
I'm going to do elimination.

601
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,010
I'm going to get
this to be simple

602
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,070
and this thing will
turn into the inverse.

603
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,460
This is what's coming.

604
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,800
I'm going to do elimination
steps to make this

605
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,240
into the identity,
and lo and behold,

606
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,550
the inverse will show up here.

607
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,330
K--- let's do it.

608
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:43,830
Okay.

609
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,880
So what are the
elimination steps?

610
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,680
So you see -- here's my matrix
A and here's the identity, like,

611
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,795
stuck on, augmented on.

612
00:38:52,795 --> 00:38:53,670
STUDENT: I'm sorry...

613
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,211
STRANG: Yeah?

614
00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:58,800
STUDENT: -- is the two and the
three supposed to be switched?

615
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,070
STRANG: Did I -- oh, no,
they weren't supposed to be

616
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,570
switched.

617
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,070
Sorry.

618
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,680
Thanks.

619
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,930
Okay.

620
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,425
Thank you very much.

621
00:39:08,425 --> 00:39:09,800
And there -- I've
got them right.

622
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,215
Okay, thanks.

623
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,510
Okay.

624
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,780
So let's do elimination.

625
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,890
All right, it's going
to be simple, right?

626
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,690
So I take two of this
row away from this row.

627
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,180
So this row stays
the same and two

628
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,680
of those come away from this.

629
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,560
That leaves me with a zero and
a one and two of these away from

630
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,970
this is that what
you're getting --

631
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,930
after one elimination step --

632
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,790
Let me sort of separate the --

633
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,040
the left half from
the right half.

634
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,690
So two of that first row got
subtracted from the second row.

635
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:53,240
Now this is an upper
triangular form.

636
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,120
Gauss would quit, but
Jordan says keeps going.

637
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,250
Use elimination upwards.

638
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:03,710
Subtract a multiple of
equation two from equation one

639
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,970
to get rid of the three.

640
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,970
So let's go the whole way.

641
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:14,420
So now I'm going to -- this guy
is fine, but I'm going to --

642
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,770
what do I do now?

643
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,850
What's my final step that
produces the inverse?

644
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,200
I multiply this by
the right number

645
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,060
to get up to ther to
remove that three.

646
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,350
So I guess, I --
since this is a one,

647
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,830
there's the pivot sitting there.

648
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,750
I multiply it by three
and subtract from that,

649
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,080
so what do I get?

650
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,460
I'll have one zero -- oh,
yeah that was my whole point.

651
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,640
I'll multiply this by three
and subtract from that,

652
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,450
which will give me seven.

653
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:49,340
And I multiply this by three
and subtract from that,

654
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,920
which gives me a minus three.

655
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:06,500
And what's my hope, belief?

656
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,780
Here I started with
A and the identity,

657
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:16,410
and I ended up with
the identity and who?

658
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,640
That better be A inverse.

659
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,980
That's the Gauss Jordan idea.

660
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:33,690
Start with this long matrix,
double-length A I, eliminate,

661
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,450
eliminate until this
part is down to I,

662
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:40,530
then this one will --
must be for some reason,

663
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:45,230
and we've got to find the
reason -- must be A inverse.

664
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,690
Shall I just check
that it works?

665
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,080
Let me just check that -- can I
multiply this matrix this part

666
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:00,300
times A, I'll carry A
over here and just do that

667
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,190
multiplication.

668
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,310
You'll see I'll do it
the old fashioned way.

669
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:06,000
Seven minus six is a one.

670
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,670
Twenty one minus
twenty one is a zero,

671
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:13,280
minus two plus two is a zero,
minus six plus seven is a one.

672
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,780
Check.

673
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,290
So that is the inverse.

674
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,950
That's the Gauss-Jordan idea.

675
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:24,190
So, you'll -- one of the
homework problems or more than

676
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:30,710
one for Wednesday will ask
you to go through those steps.

677
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,560
I think you just got to go
through Gauss-Jordan a couple

678
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,600
of times, but I --

679
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:43,690
yeah -- just to
see the mechanics.

680
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:48,000
But the, important
thing is, why --

681
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,190
is, like, what happened?

682
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,570
Why did we -- why did
we get A inverse there?

683
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,690
Let me ask you that.

684
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:03,190
We got -- so we take --

685
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:08,020
We do row reduction, we do
elimination on this long matrix

686
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:12,840
A I until the first half

687
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,990
Then a second half
is A inverse. is up.

688
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:20,050
Well, how do I see that?

689
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,310
Let me put up here
how I see that.

690
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:30,100
So here's my Gauss-Jordan thing,
and I'm doing stuff to it.

691
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,320
So I'm -- well,
whole lot of E's.

692
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,150
Remember those are those
elimination matrices.

693
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,861
Those are the -- those are the
things that we figured out last

694
00:43:42,861 --> 00:43:43,360
time.

695
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:49,370
Yes, that's what an elimination
step is it's in matrix form,

696
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,430
I'm multiplying by some Es.

697
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:55,120
And the result -- well, so I'm
multiplying by a whole bunch

698
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,650
of Es.

699
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,530
So, I get a --

700
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:02,070
can I call the overall matrix E?

701
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:06,420
That's the elimination matrix,
the product of all those little

702
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:06,920
pieces.

703
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,050
What do I mean by little pieces?

704
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,160
Well, there was an
elimination matrix

705
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,400
that subtracted two of
that away from that.

706
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,180
Then there was an
elimination matrix

707
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,160
that subtracted three
of that away from that.

708
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,370
I guess in this
case, that was all.

709
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:24,280
So there were just two
Es in this case, one

710
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,630
that did this step and
one that did this step

711
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:31,690
and together they gave me
an E that does both steps.

712
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:38,560
And the net result
was to get an I here.

713
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:45,490
And you can tell me
what that has to be.

714
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:50,240
This is, like, the
picture of what happened.

715
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,350
If E multiplied A,
whatever that E is --

716
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:59,780
we never figured
it out in this way.

717
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:06,692
But whatever that E times
that E is, E times A is --

718
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:12,120
What's E times A?

719
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,480
It's I.

720
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:20,510
That E, whatever the heck it
was, multiplied A and produced

721
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,710
So E must be --

722
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:30,640
E A equaling I tells us what
E is, I. namely it is --

723
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,110
STUDENT: It's the inverse of A.

724
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,720
STRANG: It's the inverse of A.

725
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,660
Great.

726
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:39,780
And therefore, when the second
half, when E multiplies I,

727
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,470
it's E --

728
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:44,760
Put this A inverse.

729
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,450
You see the picture
looking that way?

730
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,910
E times A is the identity.

731
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:53,480
It tells us what E has to be.

732
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,600
It has to be the
inverse, and therefore,

733
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,870
on the right-hand
side, where E --

734
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,580
where we just smartly
tucked on the identity,

735
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:03,060
it's turning in, step by step --

736
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,870
It's turning into A inverse.

737
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:12,410
There is the statement of
Gauss-Jordan elimination.

738
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:14,590
That's how you find the inverse.

739
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:19,210
Where we can look at
it as elimination,

740
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:24,260
as solving n equations
at the same time -- --

741
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,170
and tacking on n columns,
solving those equations and up

742
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:32,740
goes the n columns of
A inverse Okay, thanks.

743
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,640
See you on Wednesday.
