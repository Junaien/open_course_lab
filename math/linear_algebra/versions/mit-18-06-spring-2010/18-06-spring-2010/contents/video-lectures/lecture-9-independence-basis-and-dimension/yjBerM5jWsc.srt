1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,610
OK, this is linear
algebra lecture nine.

2
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:21,130
And this is a key lecture, this
is where we get these ideas

3
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:27,480
of linear independence,
when a bunch of vectors are

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,600
independent --

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,890
or dependent,
that's the opposite.

6
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,680
The space they span.

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,550
A basis for a subspace
or a basis for a vector

8
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,730
space, that's a central idea.

9
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,060
And then the dimension
of that subspace.

10
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,240
So this is the day
that those words

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,960
get assigned clear meanings.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,380
And emphasize that we talk
about a bunch of vectors

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,550
being independent.

14
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,780
Wouldn't talk about a
matrix being independent.

15
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,150
A bunch of vectors
being independent.

16
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,840
A bunch of vectors
spanning a space.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,480
A bunch of vectors
being a basis.

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,070
And the dimension
is some number.

19
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,480
OK, so what are the definitions?

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,840
Can I begin with a fact,
a highly important fact,

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,240
that, I didn't call directly
attention to earlier.

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,900
Suppose I have a matrix and
I look at Ax equals zero.

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,530
Suppose the matrix
has a lot of columns,

24
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,340
so that n is bigger than m.

25
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,320
So I'm looking at n equations --

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,920
I mean, sorry, m
equations, a small number

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,650
of equations m,
and more unknowns.

28
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,960
I have more unknowns
than equations.

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,040
Let me write that down.

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,850
More unknowns than equations.

31
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,170
More unknown x-s than equations.

32
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:15,440
Then the conclusion
is that there's

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,330
something in the null
space of A, other

34
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,350
than just the zero vector.

35
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,320
The conclusion is there
are some non-zero x-s

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,220
such that Ax is zero.

37
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,030
There are some
special solutions.

38
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,060
And why?

39
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,590
We know why.

40
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,120
I mean, it sort of like seems
like a reasonable thing, more

41
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,150
unknowns than equations,
then it seems reasonable

42
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,540
that we can solve them.

43
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:49,210
But we have a, a clear algorithm
which starts with a system

44
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:55,440
and does elimination, gets
the thing into an echelon

45
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,630
form with some pivots
and pivot columns,

46
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,050
and possibly some free columns
that don't have pivots.

47
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,290
And the point is here there
will be some free columns.

48
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,940
The reason, so the
reason is there must --

49
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,080
there will be free
variables, at least one.

50
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,580
That's the reason.

51
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,130
That we now have this --

52
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:36,200
a complete, algorithm, a
complete systematic way to say,

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,860
OK, we take the
system Ax equals zero,

54
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,370
we row reduce, we identify
the free variables,

55
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:48,690
and, since there are n
variables and at most m pivots,

56
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,840
there will be some free
variables, at least one,

57
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,090
at least n-m in fact, left over.

58
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,480
And those variables I can
assign non-zero values to.

59
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,110
I don't have to
set those to zero.

60
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,580
I can take them to be
one or whatever I like,

61
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,970
and then I can solve
for the pivot variables.

62
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,870
So then it gives me a
solution to Ax equals zero.

63
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,820
And it's a solution
that isn't all zeros.

64
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,769
So, that's an important
point that we'll

65
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,350
use now in this lecture.

66
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,110
So now I want to say what does
it mean for a bunch of vectors

67
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,470
to be independent.

68
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,370
OK.

69
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,276
So this is like the
background that we know.

70
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,900
Now I want to speak
about independence.

71
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,000
OK.

72
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,740
Let's see.

73
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:55,430
I can give you the abstract
definition, and I will,

74
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,325
but I would also like to
give you the direct meaning.

75
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:12,700
So the question is, when
vectors x1, x2 up to --

76
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:19,860
Suppose I have n vectors
are independent if.

77
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,350
Now I have to give you --

78
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,560
or linearly independent --

79
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,470
I'll often just say and
write independent for short.

80
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,300
OK.

81
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,580
I'll give you the
full definition.

82
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,920
These are just vectors
in some vector space.

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,360
I can take combinations of them.

84
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,070
The question is, do any
combinations give zero?

85
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,210
If some combination
of those vectors

86
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,030
gives the zero vector,
other than the combination

87
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,520
of all zeros, then
they're dependent.

88
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:06,100
They're independent if no
combination gives the zero

89
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,550
vector --

90
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:17,070
and then I have, I'll have
to put in an except the zero

91
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,840
combination.

92
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,160
So what do I mean by that?

93
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,720
No combination gives
the zero vector.

94
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,950
Any combination
c1 x1+c2 x2 plus,

95
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:39,260
plus cn xn is not zero except
for the zero combination.

96
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:45,610
This is when all the c-s,
all the c-s are zero.

97
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,315
Then of course.

98
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,100
That combination --
I know I'll get zero.

99
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,950
But the question is, does any
other combination give zero?

100
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,970
If not, then the
vectors are independent.

101
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,630
If some other combination
does give zero,

102
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,880
the vectors are dependent.

103
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,510
OK.

104
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,420
Let's just take examples.

105
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:14,510
Suppose I'm in, say, in
two dimensional space.

106
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,590
OK.

107
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,940
I give you --

108
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,900
I'd like to first
take an example --

109
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,480
let me take an example where
I have a vector and twice that

110
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,290
vector.

111
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,720
So that's two vectors, V and 2V.

112
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,830
Are those dependent
or independent?

113
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,820
Those are dependent
for sure, right,

114
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,380
because there's one
vector is twice the other.

115
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,250
One vector is twice
as long as the other,

116
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,780
so if the word dependent
means anything,

117
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,670
these should be dependent.

118
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,910
And they are.

119
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,860
And in fact, I would
take two of the first --

120
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,750
so here's, here is a vector V
and the other guy is a vector

121
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,350
2V, that's my --

122
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:04,730
so there's a vector V1 and
my next vector V2 is 2V1.

123
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,630
Of course those are
dependent, because two

124
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:14,120
of these first vectors minus
the second vector is zero.

125
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,620
That's a combination of these
two vectors that gives the zero

126
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,120
vector.

127
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,060
OK, that was clear.

128
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,430
Suppose, suppose
I have a vector --

129
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,060
here's another

130
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,800
example.

131
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,950
It's easy example.

132
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:31,010
Suppose I have a vector and the
other guy is the zero vector.

133
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:36,820
Suppose I have a vector V1
and V2 is the zero vector.

134
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:43,309
Then are those vectors
dependent or independent?

135
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:46,230
They're dependent again.

136
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,480
You could say, well, this
guy is zero times that one.

137
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,970
This one is some
combination of those.

138
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,900
But let me write
it the other way.

139
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:01,110
Let me say -- what combination,
how many V1s and how many V2s

140
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,671
shall I take to get the zero

141
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:03,170
vector?

142
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,490
If, if V1 is like the vector two
one and V2 is the zero vector,

143
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,740
zero zero, then I
would like to show

144
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,640
that some combination of
those gives the zero vector.

145
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,820
What shall I take?

146
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,660
How many V1s shall I take?

147
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,540
Zero of them.

148
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,310
Yeah, no, take no V1s.

149
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,290
But how many V2s?

150
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:28,970
Six.

151
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,700
OK.

152
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,790
Or five.

153
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,590
Then -- in other words,
the point is if the zero

154
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,340
vector's in there,
if the zero --

155
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,760
if one of these vectors
is the zero vector,

156
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,490
independence is dead, right?

157
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,440
If one of those vectors is the
zero vector then I could always

158
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,970
take --

159
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,120
include that one and
none of the others,

160
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,370
and I would get the zero answer,
and I would show dependence.

161
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,230
OK.

162
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,890
Now, let me, let me
finally draw an example

163
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,860
where they will be independent.

164
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,900
Suppose that's V1 and that's V2.

165
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,820
Those are surely
independent, right?

166
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,400
Any combination of
V1 and V2, will not

167
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,780
be zero except, the
zero combination.

168
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,390
So those would be independent.

169
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,040
But now let me, let me
stick in a third vector, V3.

170
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,200
Independent or dependent
now, those three vectors?

171
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,390
So now n is three here.

172
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:42,150
I'm in two dimensional space,
whatever, I'm in the plane.

173
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:47,390
I have three vectors that
I didn't draw so carefully.

174
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,520
I didn't even tell you
what exactly they were.

175
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,820
But what's this answer on
dependent or independent?

176
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,200
Dependent.

177
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,570
How do I know those
are dependent?

178
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,570
How do I know that some
combination of V1, V2, and V3

179
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,010
gives me the zero vector?

180
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,130
I know because of that.

181
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:20,160
That's the key
fact that tells me

182
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,990
that three vectors in the
plane have to be dependent.

183
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,120
Why's that?

184
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,650
What's the connection between
the dependence of these three

185
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,620
vectors and that fact?

186
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,140
OK.

187
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,350
So here's the connection.

188
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:42,260
I take the matrix A that has
V1 in its first column, V2

189
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,560
in its second column,
V3 in its third column.

190
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
So it's got three columns.

191
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,600
And V1 --

192
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,950
I don't know, that
looks like about two one

193
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:52,880
to me.

194
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,430
V2 looks like it
might be one two.

195
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:01,990
V3 looks like it might be maybe
two, maybe two and a half,

196
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,570
minus one.

197
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,230
OK.

198
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,900
Those are my three vectors, and
I put them in the columns of A.

199
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,530
Now that matrix A
is two by three.

200
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,960
It fits this pattern, that
where we know we've got extra

201
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,900
variables, we know we
have some free variables,

202
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,640
we know that there's
some combination --

203
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,650
and let me instead of x-s, let
me call them c1, c2, and c3 --

204
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,380
that gives the zero vector.

205
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,830
Sorry that my little bit
of art got in the way.

206
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,470
Do you see the point?

207
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,600
When I have a matrix,
I'm interested

208
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,710
in whether its columns are
dependent or independent.

209
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,470
The columns are
dependent if there

210
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,480
is something in the null space.

211
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,860
The columns are
dependent because this,

212
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,090
this thing in the
null space says

213
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:09,190
that c1 of that plus c2 of
that plus c3 of this is zero.

214
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,670
So in other words, I can go
out some V1, out some more V2,

215
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,260
back on V3, and end up zero.

216
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,850
OK.

217
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,290
So let -- here I've give the
general, abstract definition,

218
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,360
but let me repeat
that definition --

219
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,840
this is like repeat --

220
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:39,270
let me call them Vs now.

221
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:47,450
V1 up to Vn are the
columns of a matrix A.

222
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,120
In other words,
this is telling me

223
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:57,510
that if I'm in m
dimensional space,

224
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,630
like two dimensional
space in the example,

225
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,940
I can answer the
dependence-independence

226
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:10,180
question directly by
putting those vectors

227
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,580
in the columns of a matrix.

228
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:30,380
They are independent if the
null space of A, of A, is what?

229
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,370
If I have a bunch of
columns in a matrix,

230
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,870
I'm looking at
their combinations,

231
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:44,850
but that's just A times
the vector of c-s.

232
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,020
And these columns
will be independent

233
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:56,390
if the null space of
A is the zero vector.

234
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:11,960
They are dependent if there's
something else in there.

235
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,380
If there's something else in
the null space, if A times c

236
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:25,240
gives the zero vector
for some non-zero vector

237
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,575
c in the null space.

238
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,770
Then they're dependent,
because that's

239
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,380
telling me a combination of the
columns gives the zero column.

240
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,040
I think you're with
be, because we've seen,

241
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,340
like, lecture after
lecture, we're

242
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,500
looking at the combinations
of the columns and asking,

243
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,550
do we get zero or don't we?

244
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,030
And now we're giving
the official name,

245
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:54,010
dependent if we do,
independent if we don't.

246
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,890
So I could express this
in other words now.

247
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,420
I could say the rank -- what's
the rank in this independent

248
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,450
case?

249
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,020
The rank r of the,
of the matrix,

250
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,235
in the case of
independent columns, is?

251
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,740
So the columns are independent.

252
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,560
So how many pivot
columns have I got.

253
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,850
All n.

254
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,310
All the columns would
be pivot columns,

255
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,980
because free columns
are telling me

256
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,820
that they're a combination
of earlier columns.

257
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,080
So this would be the
case where the rank is n.

258
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,910
This would be the case where
the rank is smaller than n.

259
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:44,770
So in this case the rank is
n and the null space of A

260
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,750
is only the zero vector.

261
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,800
And no free variables.

262
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,400
No free variables.

263
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,975
And this is the case
yes free variables.

264
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,589
If you'll allow me to stretch
the English language that far.

265
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:16,290
That's the case where
we have, a combination

266
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,040
that gives the zero column.

267
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,089
I'm often interested in the
case when my vectors are

268
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,560
popped into a matrix.

269
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,349
So the, the definition
over there of independence

270
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,270
didn't talk about any matrix.

271
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:36,130
The vectors didn't have to be
vectors in N dimensional space.

272
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,530
And I want to give
you some examples

273
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,710
of vectors that
aren't what you think

274
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,970
of immediately as vectors.

275
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:49,420
But most of the time, this is
-- the vectors we think of are

276
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,200
columns.

277
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,570
And we can put them in a matrix.

278
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,330
And then independence
or dependence

279
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,650
comes back to the null space.

280
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,162
OK.

281
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:03,620
So that's the idea
of independence.

282
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:13,770
Can I just, yeah, let
me go on to spanning a

283
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:19,480
What does it mean for a bunch
of vectors to span a space?

284
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,580
space.

285
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,800
Well, actually, we've
seen it already.

286
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,040
You remember, if we had
a columns in a matrix,

287
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:33,130
we took all their
combinations and that gave us

288
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,640
the column space.

289
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,250
Those vectors that we started
with span that column space.

290
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,490
So spanning a space means --

291
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,440
so let me move that
important stuff right up.

292
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,050
OK.

293
00:18:54,050 --> 00:19:02,400
So vectors -- let me call
them, say, V1 up to --

294
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,360
call you some different
letter, say Vl --

295
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:15,680
span a space, a subspace,
or just a vector space

296
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:24,790
I could say, span a
space means, means

297
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:40,270
the space consists of all
combinations of those vectors.

298
00:19:46,464 --> 00:19:48,505
That's exactly what we
did with the column space.

299
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,740
So now I could say in shorthand
the columns of a matrix

300
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,090
span the column space.

301
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,750
So you remember it's a bunch of
vectors that have this property

302
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,450
that they span a space, and
actually if I give you a bunch

303
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,480
of vectors and say --

304
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,720
OK, let S be the
space that they span,

305
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,870
in other words let S contain
all their combinations,

306
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,750
that space S will
be the smallest

307
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,830
space with those
vectors in it, right?

308
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,300
Because any space with
those vectors in it

309
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,730
must have all the combinations
of those vectors in it.

310
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:34,540
And if I stop there, then
I've got the smallest space,

311
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,300
and that's the space
that they span.

312
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,800
OK.

313
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,150
So I'm just --

314
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:44,150
rather than, needing to say,
take all linear combinations

315
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:48,950
and put them in a space,
I'm compressing that

316
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,740
into the word span.

317
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:53,835
Straightforward.

318
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,015
So if I think of a, of
the column space of a

319
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:00,515
OK. matrix.

320
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,380
I've got their -- so I
start with the columns.

321
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,930
I take all their combinations.

322
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,760
That gives me the columns space.

323
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,440
They span the column space.

324
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,230
Now are they independent?

325
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,620
Maybe yes, maybe no.

326
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,060
It depends on the particular
columns that went into that

327
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,470
matrix.

328
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:29,700
But obviously I'm highly
interested in a set

329
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:36,870
of vectors that spans a
space and is independent.

330
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:41,630
That's, that means like I've
got the right number of vectors.

331
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:47,580
If I didn't have all of them,
I wouldn't have my whole space.

332
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,290
If I had more than that,
they probably wouldn't --

333
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,450
they wouldn't be independent.

334
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,860
So, like, basis -- and that's
the word that's coming --

335
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,600
is just right.

336
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,310
So here let me put
what that word means.

337
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:14,270
A basis for a vector space is,
is a, is a sequence of vectors

338
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:14,770
--

339
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:27,040
shall I call them V1, V2,
up to let me say Vd now,

340
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:33,600
I'll stop with that letters
-- that has two properties.

341
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,230
I've got enough vectors
and not too many.

342
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,340
It's a natural idea of a basis.

343
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,570
So a basis is a bunch
of vectors in the space

344
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,200
and it's a so it's a sequence
of vectors with two properties,

345
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,050
with two properties.

346
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,675
One, they are independent.

347
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,990
And two -- you
know what's coming?

348
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,040
-- they span the space.

349
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,880
OK.

350
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,050
Let me take --

351
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,510
so time for examples, of course.

352
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,320
So I'm asking you now
to put definition one,

353
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,030
the definition of independence,
together with definition two,

354
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,800
and let's look at examples,
because this is --

355
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,840
this combination
means the set I've --

356
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,690
of vectors I have is
just right, and the --

357
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,210
so that this idea of a
basis will be central.

358
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,480
I'll always be asking
you now for a basis.

359
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,760
Whenever I look at a
subspace, if I ask you for --

360
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
if you give me a basis
for that subspace,

361
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,920
you've told me what it is.

362
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:07,430
You've told me everything I need
to know about that subspace.

363
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,520
Those -- I take their
combinations and I know that I

364
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,460
need all the combinations.

365
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,210
OK.

366
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:13,790
Examples.

367
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,640
OK, so examples of a basis.

368
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,060
Let me start with two
dimensional space.

369
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,350
Suppose the space
-- say example.

370
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,150
The space is, oh,
let's make it R^3.

371
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:35,980
Real three dimensional space.

372
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,330
Give me one basis.

373
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,705
One basis is?

374
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:49,010
So I want some vectors, because
if I ask you for a basis,

375
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,390
I'm asking you for vectors,
a little list of vectors.

376
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,610
And it should be just right.

377
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:02,880
So what would be a basis
for three dimensional space?

378
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,540
Well, the first basis that
comes to mind, why don't we

379
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,240
write that down.

380
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,220
The first basis
that comes to mind

381
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:18,850
is this vector, this
vector, and this vector.

382
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,790
OK.

383
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,540
That's one basis.

384
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,190
Not the only basis, that's
going to be my point.

385
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,930
But let's just see --
yes, that's a basis.

386
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,500
Are, are those
vectors independent?

387
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,120
So that's the like the x, y,
z axes, so if those are not

388
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,780
independent, we're in trouble.

389
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,580
Certainly, they are.

390
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:48,630
Take a combination c1 of this
vector plus c2 of this vector

391
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,340
plus c3 of that
vector and try to make

392
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,290
it give the zero vector.

393
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,110
What are the c-s?

394
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:03,080
If c1 of that plus c2 of that
plus c3 of that gives me 0 0 0,

395
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,600
then the c-s are all --

396
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,920
0, right.

397
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,980
So that's the test
for independence.

398
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:16,210
In the language of matrices,
which was under that board,

399
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,700
I could make those the
columns of a matrix.

400
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,880
Well, it would be
the identity matrix.

401
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,590
Then I would ask, what's the
null space of the identity

402
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,760
matrix?

403
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,560
And you would say it's
only the zero vector.

404
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,740
And I would say, fine, then
the columns are independent.

405
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,370
The only thing -- the identity
times a vector giving zero,

406
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,810
the only vector that
does that is zero.

407
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:41,980
OK.

408
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,710
Now that's not the only basis.

409
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,660
Far from it.

410
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,680
Tell me another basis, a
second basis, another basis.

411
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:03,030
So, give me -- well,
I'll just start it out.

412
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,090
One one two.

413
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,780
Two two five.

414
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,420
Suppose I stopped there.

415
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:20,980
Has that little bunch of
vectors got the properties that

416
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,350
I'm asking for in
a basis for R^3?

417
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,880
We're looking for
a basis for R^3.

418
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,430
Are they independent,
those two column vectors?

419
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,330
Yes.

420
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,610
Do they span R^3?

421
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,340
No.

422
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,440
Our feeling is no.

423
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,550
Our feeling is no.

424
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:41,640
Our feeling is that there're
some vectors in R3 that

425
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,120
are not combinations of those.

426
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,930
OK.

427
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,830
So suppose I add in --

428
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,390
I need another vector
then, because these two

429
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,021
don't span the space.

430
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:52,520
OK.

431
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,360
Now it would be foolish for me
to put in three three seven,

432
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,810
right, as the third vector.

433
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,950
That would be a goof.

434
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,380
Because that, if I put
in three three seven,

435
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,680
those vectors would
be dependent, right?

436
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,440
If I put in three
three seven, it

437
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,170
would be the sum
of those two, it

438
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,020
would lie in the
same plane as those.

439
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,590
It wouldn't be independent.

440
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,930
My attempt to create
a basis would be dead.

441
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,420
But if I take -- so
what vector can I take?

442
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,340
I can take any vector
that's not in that plane.

443
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,430
Let me try --

444
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,590
I hope that 3 3 8 would do it.

445
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,470
At least it's not the
sum of those two vectors.

446
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,160
But I believe that's a basis.

447
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,310
And what's the test then,
for that to be a basis?

448
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,160
Because I just picked those
numbers, and if I had picked,

449
00:28:53,160 --> 00:29:02,300
5 7 -14 how would we know do
we have a basis or don't we?

450
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,430
You would put them in
the columns of a matrix,

451
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:09,280
and you would do
elimination, row reduction --

452
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:15,340
and you would see do you
get any free variables

453
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,500
or are all the
columns pivot columns.

454
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,590
Well now actually
we have a square --

455
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,760
the matrix would
be three by three.

456
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,260
So, what's the test
on the matrix then?

457
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,790
The matrix -- so in this case,
when my space is R^3 and I have

458
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:44,740
three vectors, my matrix is
square and what I asking about

459
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,780
that matrix in order for
those columns to be a basis?

460
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,190
So in this --

461
00:29:51,190 --> 00:30:06,380
for R^n, if I have -- n vectors
give a basis if the n by n

462
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:19,850
matrix with those columns,
with those columns, is what?

463
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:24,070
What's the requirement
on that matrix?

464
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,010
Invertible, right, right.

465
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,590
The matrix should be invertible.

466
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:33,187
For a square matrix, that's
the, that's the perfect answer.

467
00:30:33,187 --> 00:30:33,770
Is invertible.

468
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,380
So that's when, that's when the
space is the whole space R^n.

469
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,360
Let me, let me be sure
you're with me here.

470
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,540
Let me remove that.

471
00:30:53,540 --> 00:31:01,580
Are those two vectors a
basis for any space at all?

472
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,020
Is there a vector
space that those really

473
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,540
are a basis for, those, that
pair of vectors, this guy

474
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,580
and this 1, 1 1 2 and 2 2 5?

475
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,360
Is there a space for
which that's a basis?

476
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,220
Sure.

477
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:21,970
They're independent, so they
satisfy the first requirement,

478
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,740
so what space shall I take
for them to be a basis

479
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,240
of?

480
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,080
What spaces will
they be a basis for?

481
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,180
The one they span.

482
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,350
Their combinations.

483
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,920
It's a plane, right?

484
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,340
It'll be a plane inside R^3.

485
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,930
So if I take this vector
1 1 2, say it goes there,

486
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:44,240
and this vector 2 2
5, say it goes there,

487
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,797
those are a basis for --
because they span a plane.

488
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:52,880
And they're a basis for
the plane, because they're

489
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,550
independent.

490
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,800
If I stick in some
third guy, like 3 3 7,

491
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,050
which is in the plane -- suppose
I put in, try to put in 3 3 7,

492
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:05,740
then the three vectors
would still span the plane,

493
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,180
but they wouldn't be a basis
anymore because they're not

494
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,260
independent anymore.

495
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:19,420
So, we're looking at
the question of --

496
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,360
again,

497
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,390
OK. the case with
independent columns

498
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:32,090
is the case where the column
vectors span the column space.

499
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:35,830
They're independent, so they're
a basis for the column space.

500
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,520
OK.

501
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:42,490
So now there's one
bit of intuition.

502
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:46,420
Let me go back to all of R^n.

503
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,150
So I -- where I put 3 3 8.

504
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,740
OK.

505
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:56,510
The first message is that the
basis is not unique, right.

506
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,090
There's zillions of bases.

507
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:02,790
I take any invertible
three by three matrix,

508
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:07,800
its columns are a basis for R^3.

509
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,200
The column space is
R^3, and if those,

510
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,180
if that matrix is invertible,
those columns are independent,

511
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,100
I've got a basis for R^3.

512
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,860
So there're many, many bases.

513
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:27,730
But there is something in
common for all those bases.

514
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,810
There's something that this
basis shares with that basis

515
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,880
and every other basis for R^3.

516
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,515
And what's that?

517
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:47,410
Well, you saw it coming, because
when I stopped here and asked

518
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:51,180
if that was a basis
for R^3, you said no.

519
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,730
And I know that you said
no because you knew there

520
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,410
weren't enough vectors there.

521
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:03,670
And the great fact is that
there're many, many bases,

522
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:12,139
but -- let me put in somebody
else, just for variety.

523
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,850
There are many, many
bases, but they all

524
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:18,639
have the same number of vectors.

525
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,350
If we're talking
about the space R^3,

526
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,040
then that number of
vectors is three.

527
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,650
If we're talking
about the space R^n,

528
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,320
then that number
of vectors is n.

529
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,389
If we're talking about
some other space,

530
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:41,570
the column space of some matrix,
or the null space of some

531
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:45,420
matrix, or some other space
that we haven't even thought

532
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:52,820
of, then that still is
true that every basis --

533
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,270
that there're lots of bases but
every basis has the same number

534
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,950
of vectors.

535
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:02,000
Let me write that
great fact down.

536
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,940
Every basis --
we're given a space.

537
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,680
Given a space.

538
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:18,840
R^3 or R^n or some other column
space of a matrix or the null

539
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,790
space of a matrix or
some other vector space.

540
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,200
Then the great fact
is that every basis

541
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:40,365
for this, for the space has
the same number of vectors.

542
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,770
If one basis has six vectors,
then every other basis

543
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,770
has six vectors.

544
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,050
So that number six
is telling me like

545
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,250
it's telling me how
big is the space.

546
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,640
It's telling me
how many vectors do

547
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,650
I have to have to have a basis.

548
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,440
And of course we're
seeing it this way.

549
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,900
That number six, if
we had seven vectors,

550
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,150
then we've got too many.

551
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:17,070
If we have five vectors
we haven't got enough.

552
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:21,860
Sixes are like just right
for whatever space that is.

553
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,600
And what do we call that number?

554
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,550
That number is -- now I'm ready
for the last definition today.

555
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,650
It's the dimension
of that space.

556
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,410
So every basis for a space has
the same number of vectors in

557
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:37,910
it.

558
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:41,860
Not the same vectors,
all sorts of bases --

559
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,850
but the same number of
vectors is always the same,

560
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,010
and that number
is the dimension.

561
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,900
This is definitional.

562
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:58,245
This number is the
dimension of the space.

563
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:03,890
OK.

564
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,417
OK.

565
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:09,375
Let's do some examples.

566
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,410
Because now we've
got definitions.

567
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,550
Let me repeat the four
things, the four words that

568
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,270
have now got defined.

569
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:23,320
Independence, that looks
at combinations not

570
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,560
being zero.

571
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,700
Spanning, that looks at
all the combinations.

572
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,580
Basis, that's the
one that combines

573
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,360
independence and spanning.

574
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,460
And now we've got the idea
of the dimension of a space.

575
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,470
It's the number of
vectors in any basis,

576
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,160
because all bases
have the same number.

577
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,580
OK.

578
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,750
Let's take examples.

579
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:53,790
Suppose I take, my space
is -- examples now --

580
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,170
space is the, say, the
column space of this matrix.

581
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,240
Let me write down a matrix.

582
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,370
1 1 1, 2 1 2, and I'll
-- just to make it clear,

583
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:12,430
I'll take the sum there, 3 2 3,
and let me take the sum of all

584
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,050
-- oh, let me put
in one -- yeah,

585
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:18,530
I'll put in one one one again.

586
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,300
OK.

587
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,260
So that's four vectors.

588
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:29,310
OK, do they span the column
space of that matrix?

589
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:35,290
Let me repeat, do they span the
column space of that matrix?

590
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,700
By definition, that's
what the column space --

591
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,280
Yes. where it comes from.

592
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,470
Are they a basis for
the column space?

593
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,920
Are they independent?

594
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,860
No, they're not independent.

595
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,460
There's something
in that null space.

596
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:55,140
Maybe we can -- so let's look
at the null space of the matrix.

597
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,490
Tell me a vector that's in
the null space of that matrix.

598
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:05,320
So I'm looking for some vector
that combines those columns

599
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,350
and produces the zero column.

600
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,680
Or in other words, I'm
looking for solutions

601
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,280
to A X equals zero.

602
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,930
So tell me a vector
in the null space.

603
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:21,070
Maybe -- well, this was, this
column was that one plus that

604
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:25,030
one, so maybe if I have one of
those and minus one of those

605
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,560
that would be a
vector in the null

606
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,060
space.

607
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:33,440
So, you've already told me now,
are those vectors independent,

608
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,140
the answer is -- those column
vectors, the answer is --

609
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:38,670
no.

610
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,170
Right?

611
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,770
They're not independent.

612
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:44,060
Because -- you knew they
weren't independent.

613
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,060
Anyway, minus one
of this minus one

614
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,530
of this plus one of this zero
of that is the zero vector.

615
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,660
OK, so they're not independent.

616
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:55,720
OK.

617
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,500
They span, but they're
not independent.

618
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:04,560
Tell me a basis for
that column space.

619
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,300
What's a basis for
the column space?

620
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,220
These are all the questions that
the homework asks, the quizzes

621
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,800
ask, the final exam will ask.

622
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,710
Find a basis for the column
space of this matrix.

623
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,280
OK.

624
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,500
Now there's many
answers, but give me

625
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,590
the most natural answer.

626
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,670
Columns one and two.

627
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,170
Columns one and two.

628
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,410
That's the natural answer.

629
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,320
Those are the pivot
columns, because, I mean,

630
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,140
we s- we begin systematically.

631
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,300
We look at the first
column, it's OK.

632
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,330
We can put that in the basis.

633
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,550
We look at the second
column, it's OK.

634
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,300
We can put that in the basis.

635
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,960
The third column we
can't put in the basis.

636
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,070
The fourth column
we can't, again.

637
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,570
So the rank of the matrix is --

638
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,850
what's the rank of our matrix?

639
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,210
Two.

640
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,000
Two.

641
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,610
And, and now that rank is also
-- we also have another word.

642
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,710
We, we have a
great theorem here.

643
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:23,060
The rank of A, that rank r,
is the number of pivot columns

644
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,340
and it's also --

645
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,890
well, so now please
use my new word.

646
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,700
This, it's the number
two, of course,

647
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:41,790
two is the rank
of my matrix, it's

648
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,440
the number of pivot columns,
those pivot columns form

649
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,104
a basis, of course,
so what's two?

650
00:41:49,104 --> 00:41:49,895
It's the dimension.

651
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,580
The rank of A, the
number of pivot columns,

652
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:02,555
is the dimension of
the column space.

653
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,840
Of course, you say.

654
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,670
It had to be.

655
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,000
Right.

656
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,440
But just watch, look
for one moment at the,

657
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,240
the language, the
way the English words

658
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,810
get involved here.

659
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:28,610
I take the rank of a matrix,
the rank of a matrix.

660
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:34,580
It's a number of columns
and it's the dimension of --

661
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,810
not the dimension of the matrix,
that's what I want to say.

662
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:43,890
It's the dimension of a space,
a subspace, the column space.

663
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,800
Do you see, I don't
take the dimension of A.

664
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,600
That's not what I want.

665
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,190
I'm looking for the dimension
of the column space of A.

666
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:56,050
If you use those words right,
it shows you've got the idea

667
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,400
right.

668
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,170
Similarly here.

669
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:03,430
I don't talk about the
rank of a subspace.

670
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:05,440
It's a matrix that has a rank.

671
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,040
I talk about the
rank of a matrix.

672
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,750
And the beauty is that
these definitions just

673
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,160
merge so that the
rank of a matrix

674
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,170
is the dimension of
its column space.

675
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,840
And in this example it's two.

676
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,570
And then the further
question is, what's a basis?

677
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:25,450
And the first two
columns are a basis.

678
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:27,500
Tell me another basis.

679
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,710
Another basis for
the columns space.

680
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,390
You see I just keep
hammering away.

681
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:35,140
I apologize, but it's,
I have to be sure you

682
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,660
have the idea of basis.

683
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,940
Tell me another basis
for the column space.

684
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:47,410
Well, you could take
columns one and three.

685
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,930
That would be a basis
for the column space.

686
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:53,220
Or columns two and
three would be a basis.

687
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,660
Or columns two and four.

688
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,871
Or tell me another basis that's
not made out of those columns

689
00:43:58,871 --> 00:43:59,370
at all?

690
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:07,180
So -- I guess I'm giving you
infinitely many possibilities,

691
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:11,150
so I can't expect a
unanimous answer here.

692
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,770
I'll tell you -- but let's
look at another basis, though.

693
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:17,836
I'll just -- because it's
only one out of zillions,

694
00:44:17,836 --> 00:44:19,960
I'm going to put it down
and I'm going to erase it.

695
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:26,680
Another basis for the
column space would be --

696
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,879
let's see.

697
00:44:27,879 --> 00:44:29,670
I'll put in some things
that are not there.

698
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:33,830
Say, oh well, just to make
it -- my life easy, 2 2 2.

699
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:37,040
That's in the column space.

700
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,380
And, that was sort of obvious.

701
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,458
Let me take the sum
of those, say 6 4 6.

702
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:52,040
Or the sum of all of the
columns, 7 5 7, why not.

703
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,910
That's in the column space.

704
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:59,540
Those are independent and
I've got the number right,

705
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,290
I've got two.

706
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:02,940
Actually, this is a key point.

707
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:09,170
If you know the dimension of
the space you're working with,

708
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:14,480
and we know that this column
-- we know that the dimension,

709
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,430
DIM, the dimension of
the column space is two.

710
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:30,120
If you know the
dimension, then --

711
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,670
and we have a couple of
vectors that are independent,

712
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,710
they'll automatically be a

713
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,550
basis.

714
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:38,890
If we've got the number
of vectors right,

715
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:43,760
two vectors in this case,
then if they're independent,

716
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,037
they can't help
but span the space.

717
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:48,620
Because if they
didn't span the space,

718
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,130
there'd be a third guy
to help span the space,

719
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:54,160
but it couldn't be independent.

720
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,190
So, it just has
to be independent

721
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:01,640
if we've got the numbers right.

722
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,590
And they span.

723
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:03,280
OK.

724
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,100
Very good.

725
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,060
So you got the
dimension of a space.

726
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,870
So this was another basis
that I just invented.

727
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:09,470
OK.

728
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:16,270
Now, now I get to ask
about the null space.

729
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:18,320
What's the dimension
of the null space?

730
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,700
So we, we got a
great fact there,

731
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:28,560
the dimension of the
column space is the rank.

732
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,760
Now I want to ask you
about the null space.

733
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,190
That's the other
part of the lecture,

734
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:38,320
and it'll go on to
the next lecture.

735
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,320
OK.

736
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,230
So we know the dimension of the
column space is two, the rank.

737
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,280
What about the null space?

738
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,870
This is a vector
in the null space.

739
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,770
Are there other vectors
in the null space?

740
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,530
Yes or no?

741
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:54,870
Yes.

742
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:58,820
So this isn't a basis because
it's doesn't span, right?

743
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,970
There's more in the null
space than we've got so far.

744
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:04,570
I need another vector at least.

745
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:08,790
So tell me another
vector in the null space.

746
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:12,290
Well, the natural choice, the
choice you naturally think of

747
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:16,140
is I'm going on to
the fourth column,

748
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,210
I'm letting that free
variable be a one,

749
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:23,750
and that free variable
be a zero, and I'm asking

750
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,130
is that fourth
column a combination

751
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,410
of my pivot columns?

752
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:28,670
Yes, it is.

753
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,650
And it's -- that will do.

754
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,820
So what I've written
there are actually the two

755
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,860
special solutions, right?

756
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:44,520
I took the two free
variables, free and free.

757
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:50,410
I gave them the values 1 0
or 0 I figured out the rest.

758
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,640
So do you see, let me
just say it in words.

759
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,000
This vector, these vectors in
the null space are telling me,

760
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,190
they're telling me
the combinations

761
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:02,610
of the columns that give zero.

762
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:08,770
They're telling me in what way
the, the columns are dependent.

763
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,770
That's what the
null space is doing.

764
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:13,890
Have I got enough now?

765
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,780
And what's the null space now?

766
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,540
We have to think
about the null space.

767
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,740
These are two vectors
in the null space.

768
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,790
They're independent.

769
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:24,620
Are they a basis
for the null space?

770
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,650
What's the dimension
of the null space?

771
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:30,100
You see that those questions
just keep coming up all the

772
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,120
time.

773
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,500
Are they a basis
for the null space?

774
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,940
You can tell me the answer
even though we haven't

775
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,460
written out a proof of that.

776
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,190
Can you?

777
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,050
Yes or no?

778
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,510
Do these two special
solutions form

779
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,400
a basis for the null space?

780
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,790
In other words,
does the null space

781
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:52,390
consist of all combinations
of those two guys?

782
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:54,110
Yes or no?

783
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,180
Yes.

784
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,880
Yes.

785
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,970
The null space is
two dimensional.

786
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,500
The null space, the
dimension of the null space,

787
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,530
is the number of free variables.

788
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:09,330
So the dimension
of the null space

789
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:12,065
is the number of free variables.

790
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:21,420
And at the last second,
give me the formula.

791
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,490
This is then the key
formula that we know.

792
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:29,740
How many free variables are
there in terms of R, the rank,

793
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:35,020
m -- the number of rows,
n, the number of columns?

794
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,740
What do we get?

795
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:42,360
We have n columns, r of
them are pivot columns,

796
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:48,200
so n-r is the number of free
columns, free variables.

797
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,950
And now it's the dimension
of the null space.

798
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,000
OK.

799
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,950
That's great.

800
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:57,280
That's the key spaces, their
bases, and their dimensions.

801
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,830
Thanks.
