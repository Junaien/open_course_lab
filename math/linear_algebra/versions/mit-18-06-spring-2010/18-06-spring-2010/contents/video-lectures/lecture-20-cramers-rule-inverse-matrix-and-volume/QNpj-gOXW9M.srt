1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,250
OK, this is lecture twenty.

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:15,680
And this is the final
lecture on determinants.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,390
And it's about the applications.

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,730
So we worked hard in
the last two lectures

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,900
to get a formula
for the determinant

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,980
and the properties
of the determinant.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:35,250
Now to use the determinant and,
and always this determinant

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,710
packs all this information
into a single number.

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,800
And that number can
give us formulas

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,510
for all sorts of, things that
we've been calculating already

11
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,550
without formulas.

12
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,110
Now what was A inverse?

13
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,690
So, so I'm beginning with
the formula for A inverse.

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,450
Two, two by two formula we know,

15
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,070
right?

16
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:09,700
The two by two formula for A
inverse, the inverse of a b c d

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:22,160
inverse is one over the
determinant times d a -b -c.

18
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:31,140
Somehow I want to see what's
going on for three by three

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,140
and n by n.

20
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,200
And actually maybe you can see
what's going on from this two

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,870
by two case.

22
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,060
So there's a formula
for the inverse,

23
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,390
and what did I divide by?

24
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,880
The determinant.

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,220
So what I'm looking
for is a formula

26
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,590
where it has one
over the determinant

27
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,690
and, and you remember why
that makes good sense,

28
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:02,150
because then that's perfect as
long as the determinant isn't

29
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,330
zero, and that's exactly
when there is an inverse.

30
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,640
But now I have to ask can we
recognize any of this stuff?

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,410
Do you recognize what that
number d is from the past?

32
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,730
From last, from
the last lecture?

33
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,200
My hint is think cofactors.

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,480
Because my formula is going to
be, my formula for the inverse

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,760
is going to be one
over the determinant

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,660
times a matrix of cofactors.

37
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,290
So you remember that D?

38
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,700
What's that the cofactor of?

39
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,230
Remember cofactors?

40
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,530
If -- that's the
one one cofactor,

41
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,570
because if I strike out row and
column one, I'm left with d.

42
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,080
And what's minus b?

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,930
OK.

44
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,780
Which cofactor is that one?

45
00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:00,900
Oh, minus b is the
cofactor of c, right?

46
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,670
If I strike out the c,
I'm left with a b there.

47
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,400
And why the minus sign?

48
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,310
Because this c was in a two one
position, and two plus one is

49
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:12,910
odd.

50
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,000
So there was a minus went into
the cofactor, and that's it.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,780
OK.

52
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,710
I'll write down next
what my formula is.

53
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:26,900
Here's the big formula for
the A -- for A inverse.

54
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:35,800
It's one over the determinant
of A and then some matrix.

55
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,280
And that matrix is the
matrix of cofactors,

56
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,370
c.

57
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,330
Only one thing, it
turns -- you'll see,

58
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,920
I have to, I transpose.

59
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,760
So this is the matrix
of cofactors, the --

60
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,090
what I'll just --

61
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,710
but why don't we just call
it the cofactor matrix.

62
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:02,400
So the one one entry of, of
c is the cof- is the one one

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,840
cofactor, the thing that we get
by throwing away row and column

64
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,340
one.

65
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,770
It's the d.

66
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:15,420
And, because of the
transpose, what I see up here

67
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,140
is the cofactor of this
guy down here, right?

68
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,450
That's where the
transpose came in.

69
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,420
What I see here, this is the
cofactor not of this one,

70
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,690
because I've transposed.

71
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,920
This is the cofactor of the b.

72
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,350
When I throw away the b,
the b row and the b column,

73
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,240
I'm left with c, and then
I have that minus sign

74
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,940
again.

75
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,580
And of course the two
two entry is the cofactor

76
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,660
of d, and that's this a.

77
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,930
So there's the formula.

78
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,790
OK.

79
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,080
But we got to think why.

80
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,680
I mean, it worked in
this two by two case,

81
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,590
but a lot of other formulas
would have worked just as well.

82
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,200
We, we have to see
why that's true.

83
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,790
In other words, why is it --

84
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,530
so this is what I aim to find.

85
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,570
And, and let's just sort of
look to see what is that telling

86
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,210
us.

87
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,400
That tells us that the -- the
expression for A inverse --

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,670
let's look at a three by three.

89
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:27,240
Can I just write down
a a b c d e f g h i?

90
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,780
And I'm looking for its inverse.

91
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,340
And what kind of a
formula -- do I see there?

92
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,720
I mean, what --

93
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,630
the determinant is a bunch
of products of three factors,

94
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,370
right?

95
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,190
The determinant of this
matrix'll involve a e i,

96
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:49,160
and b f times g, and c
times d times h, and minus c

97
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,900
e g, and so on.

98
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,810
So things with three
factors go in here.

99
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:03,140
Things with how many factors do
things in the cofactor matrix

100
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,640
have?

101
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,030
What's a typical cofactor?

102
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,000
What's the cofactor of a?

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,800
The cofactor of a, the one one
entry up here in the inverse

104
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,700
is?

105
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,690
I throw away the row
and column containing a

106
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,740
and I take the determinant
of what's left,

107
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,230
that's the cofactor.

108
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,390
And that's e i minus f h.

109
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,890
Products of two things.

110
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,560
Now, I'm just making
the observation

111
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:36,900
that the determinant of A
involves products of n entries.

112
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:51,310
And the cofactor matrix involves
products of n minus 1 entries.

113
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,620
And, like, we never
noticed any of this stuff

114
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,780
when we were
computing the inverse

115
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,090
by the Gauss-Jordan
method or whatever.

116
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,380
You remember how we did it?

117
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,620
We took the matrix A, we
tucked the identity next to it,

118
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,740
we did elimination till
A became the identity.

119
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,980
And then that, the identity
suddenly was A inverse.

120
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,870
Well, that was
great numerically.

121
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,300
But we never knew what
was going on, basically.

122
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,000
And now we see
what the formula is

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,830
in terms of letters,
what's the algebra instead

124
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,530
of the algorithm.

125
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,140
OK.

126
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,780
But I have to say why
this is right, right?

127
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,940
I still -- that's a
pretty magic formula.

128
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,150
Where does it come from?

129
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,320
Well, I'll just check it.

130
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,200
Having, having got it
up there, let me --

131
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,510
I'll say, how can we check --

132
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,510
what do I want to check?

133
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,150
I want to check that A times
its inverse gives the identity.

134
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,130
So I want, I want to check
that A times this thing,

135
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,000
A times this -- now I'm going
to write in the inverse --

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,220
gives the identity.

137
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,830
So I check that A
times C transpose --

138
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,340
let me bring the
determinant up here.

139
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,490
Determinant of A
times the identity.

140
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,900
That's my job.

141
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:24,340
That's it, that if this is
true, and it is, then, then I've

142
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,760
correctly identified A
inverse as C transpose divided

143
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,810
by the determinant.

144
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,310
OK.

145
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,260
But why is this true?

146
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,220
Why is that true?

147
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,059
Let me, let me put down
what I'm doing here.

148
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,220
I have A --

149
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,630
here, here's A, here's a11 --

150
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,150
I'm doing this multiplication
-- along to a1n.

151
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:53,210
And then down in this last row
will be an an1 along to ann.

152
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:59,660
And I'm multiplying by the
cofactor matrix transposed.

153
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:07,820
So when I transpose, it'll
be c11 c12 down to c1n.

154
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,340
Notice usually that
one coming first

155
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,000
would mean I'm in row
one, but I've transposed,

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,200
so that's, those
are the cofactors.

157
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,700
This first column are the
cofactors from row one.

158
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:28,670
And then the last column would
be the cofactors from row n.

159
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,960
And why should that come
out to be anything good?

160
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,790
In fact, why should it come
out to be as good as this?

161
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:43,701
Well, you can tell me what the
one one entry in the product

162
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:44,200
is.

163
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,630
This is like you're seeing
the main point if you just

164
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,750
tell me one entry.

165
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,470
What do I get up there
in the one one entry

166
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,600
when I do this row of
this row from A times

167
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,100
this column of cofactors?

168
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,150
What, what will I get there?

169
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,460
Because we have seen this.

170
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,590
I mean, we're, right,
building exactly

171
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,290
on what the last
lecture reached.

172
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:21,130
So this is a11 times c11,
a12 times c12, a1n times c1n.

173
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,700
What does that what
does that sum up to?

174
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:32,900
That's the cofactor formula
for the determinant.

175
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,240
That's the, this
cofactor formula,

176
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,110
which I wrote, which
we got last time.

177
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,700
The determinant of A is,
if I use row one, let,

178
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,450
let I equal one,
then I have a11 times

179
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,600
its cofactor, a12 times
its cofactor, and so on.

180
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,650
And that gives me
the determinant.

181
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,470
And it worked in
this, in this case.

182
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:06,020
This row times this thing
is, sure enough, ad minus bc.

183
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,800
But this formula
says it always works.

184
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,830
So up here in this,
in this position,

185
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,470
I'm getting determinant of A.

186
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,130
What about in the
two two position?

187
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:23,460
Row two times column two
there, what, what is that?

188
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,640
That's just the cofactors,
that's just row two

189
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,960
times its cofactors.

190
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,980
So of course I get
the determinant again.

191
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,310
And in the last here,
this is the last row

192
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,780
times its cofactors.

193
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,540
It's exactly -- you see, we're
realizing that the cofactor

194
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,780
formula is just this
sum of products,

195
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,160
so of course we think,
hey, we've got a matrix

196
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,510
multiplication there.

197
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:57,870
And we get determinant of A.

198
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,920
But there's one more
idea here, right?

199
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,990
Great.

200
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,410
What else, what have I not --
so I haven't got that formula

201
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,520
completely proved yet, because
I've still got to do all

202
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,130
the off-diagonal stuff,
which I want to be zero,

203
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,120
right?

204
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,560
I just want this
to be determinant

205
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,850
of A times the identity, and
then I'm, I'm a happy person.

206
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,860
So why should that be?

207
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:30,660
Why should it be that one
row times the cofactors

208
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,920
from a different row, which
become a column because I

209
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,360
transpose, give zero?

210
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,210
In other words, the cofactor
formula gives the determinant

211
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,440
if the row and the, and
the cofactors -- you know,

212
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,050
if the entries of A and the
cofactors are for the same row.

213
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,470
But for some reason, if I
take the cofactors from the --

214
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,920
entries from the first row and
the cofactors from the second

215
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,290
row, for some reason
I automatically

216
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,270
get zero.

217
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,140
And it's sort of
like interesting

218
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,540
to say, why does that happen?

219
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,620
And can I just check that --
of course, we know it happens,

220
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,410
in this case.

221
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,060
Here are the
numbers from row one

222
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,600
and here are the cofactors
from row two, right?

223
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,820
Those are the
numbers in row one.

224
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,510
And th- these are the
cofactors from row two,

225
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,110
because the cofactor
of c is minus b

226
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,530
and the cofactor of d is

227
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,030
a.

228
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:40,380
And sure enough, that row
times this column gives --

229
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,840
please say it.

230
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,370
Zero, right.

231
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:43,870
OK.

232
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,330
So now how come?

233
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,250
How come?

234
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,190
Can we even see it in
this two by two case?

235
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,460
Why did -- well, I mean,
I guess we, you know,

236
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,352
in one way we certainly do see
it, because it's right here.

237
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:59,310
I mean, do we just do
it, and then we get zero.

238
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,870
But we want to
think of some reason

239
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:07,280
why the answer's zero, some
reason that we can use in the n

240
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,820
by n case.

241
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,590
So let -- here,
here is my thinking.

242
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,310
We must be, if we're
getting the answer's zero,

243
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,330
we suspect that what
we're doing somehow,

244
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,020
we're taking the determinant
of some matrix that

245
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,660
has two equal rows.

246
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,040
So I believe that if we multiply
these by the cofactors from

247
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,770
some other row, we're taking
the determinant -- ye,

248
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,660
what matrix are we taking
the determinant of?

249
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,380
Here it's, this is it.

250
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,900
We're, when we do that times
this, we're really taking --

251
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,510
can I put this in little
letters down here?

252
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:57,220
I'm taking -- let me look
at the matrix a b a b.

253
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:03,610
Let me call that matrix
AS, A screwed up.

254
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,290
OK.

255
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,240
All right.

256
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,260
So now that matrix is
certainly singular.

257
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,380
So if we find its determinant,
we're going to get zero.

258
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,810
But I claim that if we find
its determinant by the cofactor

259
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,960
rule, go along the
first row, we would

260
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,810
take a times the cofactor of a.

261
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,180
And what is the --

262
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,440
see, how -- oh no -- let
me go along the second row.

263
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,810
OK.

264
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,320
So let's see, which --

265
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,190
if I take --

266
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,510
I know I've got a
singular matrix here.

267
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:46,310
And I believe that when I
do this multiplication, what

268
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,110
I'm doing is using the cofactor
formula for the determinant.

269
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,700
And I know I'm
going to get zero.

270
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,530
Let me try this again.

271
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,920
So the cofactor formula
for the determinant

272
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:04,170
says I should take a times
its cofactor, which is this b,

273
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:09,260
plus b times its cofactor,
which is this minus a.

274
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,040
OK.

275
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,260
That's what we're doing,
apart from a sign here.

276
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,980
Oh yeah, so you know, there
might be a minus multiplying

277
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,950
everything.

278
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,280
So if I take this
determinant, it's A --

279
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,000
the determinant of this, the
determinant of A screwed up is

280
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,050
a times its
cofactor, which is b,

281
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,980
plus the second guy times its
cofactor, which is minus a.

282
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,790
And of course I get
the answer zero,

283
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,790
and this is exactly what's
happening in that, in that,

284
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,650
row times this wrong column.

285
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,150
OK.

286
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,460
That's the two by two picture,
and it's just the same here.

287
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:01,870
That the reason I get a zero
up in there is, the reason

288
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:09,319
I get a zero is that when I
multiply the first row of A

289
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,880
and the last row of
the cofactor matrix,

290
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,450
it's as if I'm taking the
determinant of this screwed up

291
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,420
matrix that has first
and last rows identical.

292
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,150
The book pins this
down more specific --

293
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,410
and more carefully than
I can do in the lecture.

294
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,200
I hope you're seeing the point.

295
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,130
That this is an identity.

296
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,310
That it's a beautiful
identity and it tells us what

297
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,690
the inverse of the matrix is.

298
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,820
So it gives us the inverse,
the formula for the inverse.

299
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,510
OK.

300
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,180
So that's the first goal of
my lecture, was to find this

301
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,960
formula.

302
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,490
It's done.

303
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,800
OK.

304
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,180
And of course I could
invert, now, I can,

305
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,900
I sort of like I can see what --

306
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,850
I can answer
questions like this.

307
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,510
Suppose I have a matrix,
and let me move the one one

308
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,740
entry.

309
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,600
What happens to the inverse?

310
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,780
Just, just think
about that question.

311
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,030
Suppose I have some
matrix, I just write down

312
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,300
some nice, non-singular
matrix that's got an inverse,

313
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,170
and then I move the one
one entry a little bit.

314
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,880
I add one to it, for example.

315
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,730
What happens to
the inverse matrix?

316
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,160
Well, this formula
should tell me.

317
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,110
I have to look to see what
happens to the determinant

318
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,400
and what happens to
all the cofactors.

319
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,300
And, the picture,
it's all there.

320
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,960
It's all there.

321
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,420
We can really understand
how the inverse changes

322
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,250
when the matrix changes.

323
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,330
OK.

324
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:58,910
Now my second application is to
-- let me put that over here --

325
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,630
is to Ax=b.

326
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:09,060
Well, the -- course, the
solution is A inverse b.

327
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,820
But now I have a
formula for A inverse.

328
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:17,170
A inverse is one
over the determinant

329
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:22,030
times this C transpose times B.

330
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,510
I now know what A inverse is.

331
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,270
So now I just have to
say, what have I got here?

332
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:33,600
Is there any way to, to make
this formula, this answer,

333
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,550
which is the one
and only answer --

334
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,980
it's the very same answer we got
on the first day of the class

335
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,620
by elimination.

336
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,290
Now I'm -- now I've got
a formula for the answer.

337
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,890
Can I play with it further
to see what's going on?

338
00:19:51,890 --> 00:20:01,640
And Cramer's, this Cramer's
Rule is exactly, that --

339
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,010
a way of looking
at this formula.

340
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,510
OK.

341
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,620
So this is a formula for x.

342
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,620
Here's my formula.

343
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,350
Well, of course.

344
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,050
The first thing I
see from the formula

345
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:21,100
is that the answer x always
has that in the determinant.

346
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,590
I'm not surprised.

347
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,240
There's a division
by the determinant.

348
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,190
But then I have to say a little
more carefully what's going on

349
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,610
And let me tell you what
Cramer's Rule is. up here.

350
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,610
Let, let me take x1,
the first component.

351
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,740
So this is the first
component of the answer.

352
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,870
Then there'll be a
second component and a,

353
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,900
all the other components.

354
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,310
Can I take just the first
component of this formula?

355
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:52,040
Well, I certainly have
determinant of A down under.

356
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,400
And what the heck
is the first --

357
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,300
so what do I get
in C transpose b?

358
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,440
What's the first entry
of C transpose b?

359
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,060
That's what I have
to answer myself.

360
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,420
Well, what's the first
entry of C transpose b?

361
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,670
This B is -- let me
tell you what it is.

362
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,170
OK.

363
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,290
Somehow I'm
multiplying cofactors

364
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,970
by the entries of B,
right, in this product.

365
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,430
Cofactors from the matrix
times entries of b.

366
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,650
So any time I'm multiplying
cofactors by numbers,

367
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,980
I think, I'm getting the
determinant of something.

368
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,990
And let me call
that something B1.

369
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:46,730
So this is a matrix, the matrix
whose determinant is coming out

370
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,230
of that.

371
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,530
And we'll, we'll see what it is.

372
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:54,550
x2 will be the determinant
of some other matrix B2, also

373
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,650
divided by determinant of A.

374
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,190
So now I just --

375
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,970
Cramer just had a good idea.

376
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:06,920
He realized what matrix it was,
what these B1 and B2 and B3

377
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,470
and so on matrices were.

378
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,520
Let me write them on
the board underneath.

379
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,260
OK.

380
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,470
So what is this B1?

381
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:24,430
This B1 is the matrix that
has b in its first column

382
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,900
and otherwise the
rest of it is A.

383
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:38,740
So it otherwise it has the
rest, the, the n-1 columns of A.

384
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,880
It's the matrix with --

385
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:51,410
it's just the matrix A
with column one replaced

386
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:58,520
by the right-hand side,
by the right-hand side b.

387
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,490
Because somehow when I take
the determinant of this guy,

388
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:09,140
it's giving me this
matrix multiplication.

389
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,570
Well, how could that be?

390
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,490
How could -- so what's,
what's the determinant formula

391
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,050
I'll use here?

392
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,910
I'll use cofactors, of course.

393
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,240
And I might as well use
cofactors down column one.

394
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,910
So when I use cofactors
down column one,

395
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:32,840
I'm taking the first
entry of b times what?

396
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,650
Times the cofactor c11.

397
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,410
Do you see that?

398
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,830
When I, when I use
cofactors here,

399
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,530
I take the first
entry here, B one

400
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,120
let's call it, times
the cofactor there.

401
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,390
But what's the cofactor in --
my little hand-waving is meant

402
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,650
to indicate that it's a
matrix of one size smaller,

403
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,030
the cofactor.

404
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,730
And it's exactly c11.

405
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,130
Well, that's just
what we wanted.

406
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:06,200
This first entry
is c11 times b1.

407
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:13,970
And then the next entry is
whatever, is c21 times b2,

408
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,860
and so on.

409
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,310
And sure enough, if
I look here, when

410
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,720
I'm, when I do the
cofactor expansion,

411
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,790
b2 is getting multiplied by
the right thing, and so on.

412
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,400
So there's Cramer's Rule.

413
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,560
And the book gives
another kind of cute proof

414
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,960
without, without building
so much on, on cofactors.

415
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,950
But here we've got
cofactors, so I thought

416
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,650
I'd just give you this proof.

417
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,700
So what is B --

418
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,430
in general, what is Bj?

419
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:58,970
This is the, this is A with
column j replaced by, by b.

420
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:08,870
So that's -- the determinant
of that matrix that you divide

421
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,700
by determinant of A to get xj.

422
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,980
So x -- let me change
this general formula.

423
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,190
xj, the j-th one,
is the determinant

424
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,510
of Bj divided by the
determinant of A.

425
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,360
And now we've said what Bj is.

426
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,720
Well, so Cramer found a rule.

427
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,320
And we could ask him, OK,
great, good work, Cramer.

428
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,180
But is your rule any
good in practice?

429
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:49,960
So he says, well, you couldn't
ask about a rule in mine,

430
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,220
right, because it's just --

431
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,850
all you have to do is find
the determinant of A and these

432
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,220
other determinants, so I guess
-- oh, he just says, well,

433
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,140
all you have to do is
find n+1 determinants,

434
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,170
the, the n Bs and the A.

435
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:17,530
And actually, I remember
reading -- there was a book,

436
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:22,530
popular book that, that kids
interested in math read when I

437
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,980
was a kid interested in
math called Mathematics

438
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,840
for the Million or something,
by a guy named Bell.

439
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,830
And it had a little page
about linear algebra.

440
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:39,000
And it said,-- so it
explained elimination

441
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,250
in a very complicated way.

442
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,200
I certainly didn't
understand it.

443
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,950
And, and it made it, you
know, it sort of said, well,

444
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,120
there is this formula
for elimination,

445
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,770
but look at this great
formula, Cramer's Rule.

446
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,410
So it certainly said Cramer's
Rule was the way to go.

447
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:05,180
But actually, Cramer's Rule
is a disastrous way to go,

448
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,920
because to compute
these determinants,

449
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,060
it takes, like,
approximately forever.

450
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:17,020
So actually I now think
of that book title

451
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,980
as being Mathematics
for the Millionaire,

452
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,160
because you'd have to
be able to pay for,

453
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,570
a hopelessly long calculation
where elimination, of course,

454
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,450
produced the x-s, in an instant.

455
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:36,060
But having a formula allows
you to, with, with letters, you

456
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,010
know, allows you to do algebra
instead of, algorithms.

457
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:44,220
So the, there's some value
in the Cramer's Rule formula

458
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:52,000
for x and in the explicit
formula for, for A inverse.

459
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,890
They're nice
formulas, but I just

460
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,710
don't want you to use them.

461
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,230
That'ss what it comes to.

462
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,960
If you had to -- and Matlab
would never, never do it.

463
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,480
I mean, it would
use elimination.

464
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,720
OK.

465
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,380
Now I'm ready for number
three in today's list

466
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:17,790
of amazing connections coming
through the determinant.

467
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,900
And that number three is the
fact that the determinant gives

468
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,950
a volume.

469
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,480
OK.

470
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,860
So now -- so that's
my final topic for --

471
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,070
among these -- this my
number three application,

472
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,700
that the determinant is actually
equals the volume of something.

473
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,720
Can I use this little space
to consider a special case,

474
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,050
and then I'll use the
far board to think

475
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,840
about the general rule.

476
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,400
So what I going to prove?

477
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,970
Or claim.

478
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,950
I claim that the
determinant of the matrix

479
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:02,800
is the volume of a box.

480
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,930
OK, and you say, which box?

481
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:06,970
Fair enough.

482
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,570
OK.

483
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:11,670
So let's see.

484
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:16,170
I'm in -- shall we say we're
in, say three by three?

485
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,780
Shall we suppose -- let's,
let's say three by three.

486
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,680
So, so we can really -- we're,
we're talking about boxes

487
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,400
in three dimensions, and
three by three matrices.

488
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,990
And so all I do -- you
could guess what the box is.

489
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,700
Here is, here is,
three dimensions.

490
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,450
OK.

491
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:41,880
Now I take the first row of
the matrix, a11, a22, A --

492
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,360
sorry. a11, a12, a13.

493
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,090
That row is a vector.

494
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,190
It goes to some point.

495
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,220
That point will be -- and
that edge going to it,

496
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,650
will be an edge of the box,
and that point will be a corner

497
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,740
of the box.

498
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,010
So here is zero zero
zero, of course.

499
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:09,500
And here's the first row of
the matrix: a11, a12, a13.

500
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,840
So that's one edge of the box.

501
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,700
Another edge of the box
is to the second row

502
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,820
of the matrix, row two.

503
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,510
Can I just call
it there row two?

504
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:28,760
And a third row of
the box will be to --

505
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,200
a third row -- a third edge of
the box will be given by row

506
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,300
three.

507
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,470
So, so there's row three.

508
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,780
That, the coordinates,
what are the coordinates

509
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,030
of that corner of the box?

510
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:47,650
a31, a32, a33.

511
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,220
So I've got that edge of the
box, that edge of the box,

512
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,830
that edge of the box,
and that's all I need.

513
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:59,820
Now I just finish
out the box, right?

514
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,650
I just -- the proper word,
of course, is parallelepiped.

515
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:08,920
But for obvious
reasons, I wrote box.

516
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,550
OK.

517
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,360
So, OK.

518
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,550
So there's the, there's
the bottom of the box.

519
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:19,660
There're the four
edge sides of the box.

520
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,570
There's the top of the box.

521
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,540
Cute, right?

522
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,470
It's the box that
has these three edges

523
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,080
and then it's completed to
a, to a, each, you know,

524
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,080
each side is a, is
a parallelogram.

525
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:43,050
And it's that box whose volume
is given by the determinant.

526
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:50,650
That's -- now it's -- possible
that the determinant is

527
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,920
negative.

528
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,110
So we have to just say
what's going on in that case.

529
00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:01,840
If the determinant is
negative, then the volume, we,

530
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,030
we should take the
absolute value really.

531
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,030
So the volume, if we, if we
think of volume as positive,

532
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:11,310
we should take the absolute
value of the determinant.

533
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,400
But the, the sign, what does
the sign of the determinant --

534
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,560
it always must
tell us something.

535
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,380
And somehow it, it will tell
us whether these three is a --

536
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,270
whether it's a right-handed
box or a left-handed box.

537
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:30,300
If we, if we reversed
two of the edges,

538
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,250
we would go between
a right-handed box

539
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,390
and a left-handed box.

540
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,440
We wouldn't change the
volume, but we would

541
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,500
change the, the cyclic, order.

542
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,900
So I won't worry about that.

543
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,020
And, so one special
case is what?

544
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,930
A equal identity matrix.

545
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,070
So let's take that special case.

546
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,520
A equal identity matrix.

547
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,550
Is the formula determinant
of identity matrix,

548
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,230
does that equal the
volume of the box?

549
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,460
Well, what is the box?

550
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,370
What's the box?

551
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,230
If A is the identity matrix,
then these three rows are

552
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:17,460
the three coordinate
vectors, and the box is --

553
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,920
it's a cube.

554
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,200
It's the unit cube.

555
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,970
So if, if A is the
identity matrix, of course

556
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,080
our formula is

557
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,850
Well, actually that
proves property one --

558
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,740
that the volume right.
has property one.

559
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,440
Actually, we could, we could,
we could get this thing if we --

560
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,210
if we can show that the box
volume has the same three

561
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,010
properties that define
the determinant,

562
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:44,060
then it must be the determinant.

563
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:51,080
So that's like the, the, the
elegant way to prove this.

564
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,860
To prove this amazing fact
that the determinant equals

565
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:58,540
the volume, first we'll check
it for the identity matrix.

566
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,470
That's fine.

567
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,190
The box is a cube
and its volume is one

568
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,180
and the determinant is one
and, and one agrees with one.

569
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,590
Now let me take one -- let me
go up one level to an orthogonal

570
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,889
matrix.

571
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,060
Because I'd like to take this
chance to bring in chapter --

572
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,750
the, the previous chapter.

573
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,100
Suppose I have an
orthogonal matrix.

574
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,110
What did that mean?

575
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,500
I always called those things Q.

576
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,909
What was the point
of -- suppose I have,

577
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:32,670
suppose instead of the identity
matrix I'm now going to take A

578
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:36,910
equal Q, an orthogonal matrix.

579
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,510
What was Q then?

580
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:52,179
That was a matrix whose columns
were orthonormal, right?

581
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,610
Those were its columns
were unit vectors,

582
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,059
perpendicular unit vectors.

583
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,090
So what kind of a
box have we got now?

584
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:06,520
What kind of a box comes
from the rows or the columns,

585
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,530
I don't mind, because
the determinant

586
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,420
is the determinant
of the transpose,

587
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,850
so I'm never worried about

588
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:12,730
that.

589
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,850
What kind of a box,
what shape box have we

590
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,380
got if the matrix is
an orthogonal matrix?

591
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,040
It's another cube.

592
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,710
It's a cube again.

593
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,900
How is it different
from the identity cube?

594
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,140
It's just rotated.

595
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,830
It's just the orthogonal
matrix Q doesn't

596
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,860
have to be the identity matrix.

597
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:43,240
It's just the unit cube
but turned in space.

598
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,490
So sure enough, it's the unit
cube, and its volume is one.

599
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:53,410
Now is the determinant one?

600
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,410
What's the determinant of Q?

601
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,980
We believe that the determinant
of Q better be one or minus

602
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,100
one, so that our formula
is -- checks out in that --

603
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,800
if we can't check it in these
easy cases where we got a cube,

604
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,020
we're not going to get
it in the general case.

605
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:18,290
So why is the determinant
of Q equal one or minus one?

606
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,810
What do we know about Q?

607
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:25,050
What's the one matrix statement
of the properties of Q?

608
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,020
A matrix with orthonormal
columns has --

609
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,860
satisfies a certain equation.

610
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,400
What, what is that?

611
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,930
It's if we have this orthogonal
matrix, then the fact --

612
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:45,550
the way to say what it, what
its properties are is this.

613
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:50,940
Q prime, u- u- Q
transpose Q equals I.

614
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,790
Right?

615
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:57,450
That's what -- those are the
matrices that get the name Q,

616
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:01,241
the matrices that
Q transpose Q is I.

617
00:37:01,241 --> 00:37:01,740
OK.

618
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:07,180
Now from that, tell me
why is the determinant one

619
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,500
or minus one.

620
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,930
How do I, out of this fact --

621
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,525
this may even be a
homework problem.

622
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,890
It's there in the, in the
list of exercises in the book,

623
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,100
and let's just do it.

624
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,340
How do I get, how do I discover
that the determinant of Q

625
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,530
is one or maybe minus one?

626
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,180
I take determinants of
both sides, everybody says,

627
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,870
so I won't --

628
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,610
I take determinants
of both sides.

629
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,250
On the right-hand side -- so
I, when I take determinants

630
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:46,240
of both sides,
let me just do it.

631
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,315
Take the determinant of
-- take determinants.

632
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,970
Determinant of the
identity is one.

633
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,840
What's the determinant
of that product?

634
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,400
Rule nine is paying off now.

635
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,920
The determinant of a product is
the determinant of this guy --

636
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,110
maybe I'll put it, I'll use
that symbol for determinant.

637
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:14,152
It's the determinant of that
guy times the determinant

638
00:38:14,152 --> 00:38:14,860
of the other guy.

639
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,400
And then what's the
determinant of Q transpose?

640
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,990
It's the same as the
determinant of Q.

641
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,810
Rule ten pays off.

642
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:28,330
So this is just
this thing squared.

643
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:33,740
So that determinant squared is
one and sure enough it's one

644
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,290
or minus one.

645
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:35,790
Great.

646
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:42,000
So in these special
cases of cubes,

647
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,650
we really do have
determinant equals volume.

648
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:54,530
Now can I just push
that to non-cubes.

649
00:38:54,530 --> 00:39:02,930
Let me push it first to
rectangles, rectangular boxes,

650
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:07,820
where I'm just multiplying
the e- the edges are --

651
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,440
let me keep all the
ninety degree angles,

652
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,510
because those are -- that,
that makes my life easy.

653
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,910
And just stretch the edges.

654
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:21,910
Suppose I stretch that first
edge, suppose this first edge

655
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,230
I double.

656
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:27,990
Suppose I double
that first edge,

657
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,060
keeping the other
edges the same.

658
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,650
What happens to the volume?

659
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,640
It doubles, right?

660
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,420
We know that the volume
of a cube doubles.

661
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,370
In fact, because we know that
the new cube would sit right

662
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,400
on top --

663
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,210
I mean, the new, the added
cube would sit right on --

664
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,620
would fit --

665
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,120
probably a geometer would
say congruent or something --

666
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,810
would go right in, in the other.

667
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:52,830
We'd have two.

668
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,540
We have two identical cubes.

669
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,421
Total volume is now two.

670
00:39:58,421 --> 00:39:58,920
OK.

671
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,392
So I want -- if I double an
edge, the volume doubles.

672
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:03,725
What happens to the determinant?

673
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:14,880
If I double, the first
row of a matrix, what ch-

674
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,010
ch- what's the effect
on the determinant?

675
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,320
It also doubles, right?

676
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,910
And that was rule number 3a.

677
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,500
Remember rule 3a was
that if I, I could,

678
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:36,780
if I had a factor in, in row
one, T, I could factor it out.

679
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,020
So if, if I have a factor
two in that row one,

680
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,340
I can factor it out
of the determinant.

681
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:48,860
It agrees with the -- the volume
of the box has that factor two.

682
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,140
So, so volume satisfies
this property 3a.

683
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:59,040
And now I really close, but I
-- but to get to the very end

684
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,980
of this proof, I have
to get away from right

685
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,650
angles.

686
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:10,330
I have to allow the
possibility of, other angles.

687
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,090
And -- or what's
saying the same thing,

688
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:18,600
I have to check that the
volume also satisfies 3b.

689
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,600
So can I --

690
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,740
This is end of proof
that the -- so I'm --

691
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:34,380
determinant of A equals volume
of box, and where I right now?

692
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:40,820
This volume has properties,
properties one, no problem.

693
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,030
If the box is the
cube, everything is --

694
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:49,000
if the box is the unit
cube, its volume is one.

695
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,680
Property two was if
I reverse two rows,

696
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,960
but that doesn't change the box.

697
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,520
And it doesn't change the
absolute value, so no problem

698
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,200
there.

699
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,890
Property 3a was if I mul-
you remember what 3a was?

700
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:10,390
So property one was about
the identity matrix.

701
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,900
Property two was about
a plus or minus sign

702
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,560
that I don't care about.

703
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,490
Property 3a was a
factor T in a row.

704
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:24,080
But now I've got property
three B to deal with.

705
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,520
What was property 3b?

706
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,270
This is a great way to
review these, properties.

707
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:34,860
So that 3b, the property
3b said -- let's do,

708
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,910
let's do two by two.

709
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:42,620
So said that if I
had a+a', b+b', c,

710
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:47,590
d that this equaled what?

711
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,120
So this is property 3b.

712
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,840
This is the linearity
in row one by itself.

713
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:59,060
So c d is staying the same,
and I can split this into a b

714
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,340
and a' b'.

715
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:12,890
That's property 3b, at least
in the two by two case.

716
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,340
And what I --

717
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:20,540
I wanted now to show
that the volume, which

718
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:25,040
two, two by two, that
means area, has this,

719
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:25,790
has this property.

720
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,540
Let me just emphasize that we
have got -- we're getting --

721
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:37,150
this is a formula, then, for
the area of a parallelogram.

722
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,310
The area of this parallelogram
-- can I just draw it?

723
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,160
OK, here's the, here's
the parallelogram.

724
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,370
I have the row a b.

725
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,000
That's the first row.

726
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,260
That's the point a b.

727
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,060
And I tack on c d.

728
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,690
c d, coming out of here.

729
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,065
And I complete
the parallelogram.

730
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,750
So this is --

731
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:08,140
well, I better
make it look right.

732
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,530
It's really this one that has
coordinates c d and this has

733
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:17,040
coordinates -- well,
whatever the sum is.

734
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,820
And of course
starting at zero zero.

735
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,026
So we all know,
this is a+c, b+d.

736
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,120
Rather than --

737
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,460
I'm pausing on that
proof for a minute

738
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,320
just to going back
to our formula.

739
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,650
Because I want you to see
that unlike Cramer's Rule,

740
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,060
that I wasn't that
impressed by, I'm

741
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,640
very impressed by this
formula for the area

742
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,540
of a parallelogram.

743
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,930
And what's our formula?

744
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:54,890
What, what's the area
of that parallelogram?

745
00:44:54,890 --> 00:45:00,250
If I had asked you
that last year,

746
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:03,950
you would have said OK,
the area of a parallelogram

747
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,060
is the base times the height,

748
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,190
right?

749
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:10,890
So you would have figured
out what this base, the --

750
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,850
how long that base was.

751
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:16,182
It's like the square root
of A squared plus b squared.

752
00:45:16,182 --> 00:45:17,640
And then you would
have figured out

753
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,360
how much is this
height, whatever it is.

754
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,920
It's horrible.

755
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,330
This, I mean, we got square
roots, and in that height

756
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,040
there would be other
revolting stuff.

757
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,800
But now what's the formula
that we now know for the area?

758
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:45,740
It's the determinant
of our little matrix.

759
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,050
It's just ad-bc.

760
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,110
No square roots.

761
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:03,000
Totally rememberable, because
it's exactly a formula

762
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,960
that we've been studying the
whole, for three lectures.

763
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,460
OK.

764
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,960
That's, you know, that's
the most important point

765
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,190
I'm making here.

766
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:20,990
Is that if you know the
coordinates of a box,

767
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:24,750
of the corners, then
you have a great formula

768
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:28,620
for the volume,
area or volume, that

769
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:33,550
doesn't involve any lengths
or any angles or any heights,

770
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:37,850
but just involves the
coordinates that you've got.

771
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:40,390
And similarly, what's the
area of this triangle?

772
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:43,530
Suppose I chop that off
and say what about --

773
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,810
because you might often be
interested in a triangle

774
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,330
instead of a parallelogram.

775
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,725
What's the area
of this triangle?

776
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,950
Now there again,
everybody would have

777
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:58,110
said the area of a triangle is
half the base times the height.

778
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,300
And in some cases, if you know
the base that a, that's --

779
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,300
and the height, that's fine.

780
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,280
But here, we, what we know is
the coordinates of the corners.

781
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,980
We know the vertices.

782
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,690
And so what's the
area of that triangle?

783
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:22,550
If I know these, if I know
a b, c d, and zero zero,

784
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:25,060
what's the area?

785
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,670
It's just half, so
it's just half of this.

786
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:33,040
So this is, this
is a- a b -- a d -

787
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:38,870
b c for the parallelogram
and one half of that,

788
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:43,585
one half of ad-bc
for the triangle.

789
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,900
So I mean, this is a totally
trivial remark, to say, well,

790
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,630
divide by two.

791
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:56,910
But it's just that you
more often see triangles,

792
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:01,530
and you feel you know
the formula for the area

793
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,950
but the good formula for
the area is this one.

794
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,760
And I'm just going to --

795
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,260
I'm just going to
say one more thing

796
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,750
about the area of a triangle.

797
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,220
It's just because
it's -- you know,

798
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,760
it's so great to have a
good formula for something.

799
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,990
What if our triangle did
not start at zero zero?

800
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:25,630
What if our triangle,
what if we had this --

801
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:28,390
what if we had -- so I'm
coming back to triangles again.

802
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:40,320
But let me, let me put this
triangle somewhere, it's --

803
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,800
I'm staying with triangles,
I'm just in two dimensions,

804
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:53,280
but I'm going to allow you
to give me any three corners.

805
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,430
And in -- those six numbers
must determine the area.

806
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,750
And what's the formula?

807
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,280
The area is going
to be, it's going

808
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,530
to be, there'll be that
half of a parallelogram.

809
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:13,580
I mean, basically this can't
be completely new, right?

810
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,230
We've got the area when -- we,
we know the area when this is

811
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:20,400
zero zero.

812
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,810
Now we just want to lift our
sight slightly and get the area

813
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:27,820
when all th- so let me
write down what it, what it

814
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,190
comes out to be.

815
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:37,390
It turns out that if you do
this, x1 y1 and a 1, x2 y2

816
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:44,150
and a 1, x3 y3 and a
1, that that works.

817
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:47,320
That the determinant
symbol, of course.

818
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,640
It's just -- if I gave you
that determinant to find,

819
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,890
you might subtract
this row from this.

820
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,780
It would kill that one.

821
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,170
Subtract this row from this,
it would kill that one.

822
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,470
Then you'd have a simple
determinant to do with

823
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:06,300
differences, and it would --

824
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,960
this little
subtraction, what I did

825
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,580
was equivalent to
moving the triangle

826
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,550
to start at the origin.

827
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,850
I did it fast,
because time is up.

828
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:24,530
And I didn't complete
that proof of 3b.

829
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:28,930
I'll leave -- the book has a
carefully drawn figure to show

830
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:30,870
why that works.

831
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:34,110
But I hope you saw
the main point is

832
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,760
that for area and
volume, determinant

833
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,540
gives a great formula.

834
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,100
OK.

835
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:44,410
And next lectures are
about eigenvalues,

836
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:47,780
so we're really
into the big stuff.

837
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,330
Thanks.
