1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,130
OK, this is quiz review day.

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:17,750
The quiz coming up on
Wednesday will before this

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,520
lecture the quiz will be this
hour one o'clock Wednesday

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,740
in Walker, top floor of Walker,
closed book, all normal.

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,760
I wrote down what we've
covered in this second part

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,830
of the course, and actually
I'm impressed as I write it.

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,250
so that's chapter
four on orthogonality

8
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,790
and you're remembering these --

9
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,530
what this is suggesting,
these are those columns are

10
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:56,810
orthonormal vectors, and then
we call that matrix Q and the --

11
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,270
what's the key -- how do we
state the fact that those v-

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,989
those columns are
orthonormal in terms of Q,

13
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:11,920
it means that Q transpose
Q is the identity.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,480
So that's the matrix
statement of the --

15
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,930
of the property that the
columns are orthonormal,

16
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,710
the dot products are
either one or zero,

17
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:30,160
and then we computed the
projections onto lines and onto

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,920
subspaces, and we used that
to solve problems Ax=b in --

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,800
in the least square sense,
when there was no solution,

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,640
we found the best solution.

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,530
And then finally this
Graham-Schmidt idea,

22
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:50,790
which takes independent vectors
and lines them up, takes --

23
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,000
subtracts off the
projections of the part

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,390
you've already done, so that
the new part is orthogonal

25
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,850
and so it takes a basis
to an orthonormal basis.

26
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,440
And you -- those calculations
involve square roots a lot

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,300
because you're making
things unit vectors,

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,440
but you should know that step.

29
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,540
OK, for determinants,
the three big --

30
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,720
the big picture is the
properties of the determinant,

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,020
one to three d- properties
one, two and three, d-

32
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,590
that define the determinant,
and then four, five,

33
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,110
six through ten
were consequences.

34
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,330
Then the big formula that has
n factorial terms, half of them

35
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,350
have plus signs and half
minus signs, and then

36
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,420
the cofactor formula.

37
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:46,240
So and which led us to a
formula for the inverse.

38
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,780
And finally, just
so you know what's

39
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,550
covered in from chapter
three, it's section six point

40
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,920
one and two, so that's the
basic idea of eigenvalues

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,660
and eigenvectors, the
equation for the eigenvalues,

42
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,800
the mechanical step, this
is really Ax equal lambda

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,450
x for all n
eigenvectors at once,

44
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,480
if we have n independent
eigenvectors,

45
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,520
and then using that to
compute powers of a matrix.

46
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,430
So you notice the differential
equations not on this list,

47
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,390
because that's six point three,
that that's for the third quiz.

48
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,330
OK.

49
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:36,140
Shall I what I usually do for
review is to take an old exam

50
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,720
and just try to pick out
questions that are significant

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,070
and write them quickly
on the board, shall I --

52
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,210
shall I proceed that way again?

53
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:51,650
This -- this exam is really old.

54
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,770
November nineteen --
nineteen eighty-four,

55
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,850
so that was before
the Web existed.

56
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,760
So not only were the
lectures not on the Web,

57
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,260
nobody even had a
Web page, my God.

58
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,760
OK, so can I nevertheless
linear algebra

59
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,530
was still as great as ever.

60
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:22,290
So may I and that wasn't meant
to be a joke, OK, all right,

61
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,575
so let me just take these
questions as they come.

62
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:28,930
All right.

63
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,260
OK.

64
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,460
So the first question's
about projections.

65
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,670
It says we're given
the line, the --

66
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,930
the vector a is the
vector two, one, two,

67
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,320
and I want to find the
projection matrix P that

68
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,900
projects onto the
line through a.

69
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,510
So my picture is, well I'm in
three dimensions, of course,

70
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,710
so there's a vector, two --
there's the vector a, two, one,

71
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,210
two, let me draw the
whole line through it,

72
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:05,690
and I want to project any
vector b onto that line,

73
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,490
and I'm looking for
the projection matrix.

74
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,360
So -- so this -- the projection
matrix is the matrix that I

75
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,320
multiply b by to get here.

76
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,260
And I guess this first
part, this is just part one

77
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,860
a, I'm really asking you the
-- the quick way to answer,

78
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,600
to find P, is just to
remember what the formula is.

79
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,740
And -- and we're in -- we're
projecting onto a line,

80
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,800
so our formula, our -- our
usual formula is AA transpose A

81
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,800
inverse A transpose, but
now A is just a column,

82
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,920
one-column matrix, so it'll be
just a, so I'll just call it

83
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,850
little a, little a transpose,
and this is just a number now,

84
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,970
one by one, so I can put
it in the denominator,

85
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,950
so there's our --

86
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,560
that's really what we
want to remember, and --

87
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,490
and using that two, one,
two, what will I get?

88
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,280
I'm dividing by --

89
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,020
what's the length
squared of that vector?

90
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,970
So what's a transpose a?

91
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,370
Looks like nine, and what's
the matrix, well, I'm --

92
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,580
I'm doing two, one,
two against two,

93
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:28,520
one, two, so it's one-ninth of
this matrix four, two, four,

94
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,790
two, one, two, four, two, four.

95
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,410
Now the next part asked
about eigenvalues.

96
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,450
So you see we're --
since we're learning,

97
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,070
we know a lot more now, we can
make connections between these

98
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,880
chapters, so what's
the eigenvector,

99
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,200
what are the eigenvalues of P?

100
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,140
I could ask what's
the rank of P. What's

101
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,860
the rank of that matrix?

102
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,120
Uh -- one.

103
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,410
Rank is one.

104
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,780
What's the column space?

105
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,780
If I apply P to all vectors
then I fill up the column space,

106
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,650
it's combinations of the
columns, so what's the column

107
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,880
space?

108
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,370
Well, it's just this line.

109
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,310
The column space is the
line through two, one, two.

110
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,770
And now what's the eigenvalue?

111
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,090
So, or since that
matrix has rank one,

112
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,750
so tell me the eigenvalues
of this matrix.

113
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,330
It's a singular
matrix, so it certainly

114
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,970
has an eigenvalue zero.

115
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,470
Actually, the rank
is only one, so that

116
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,720
means that there
like going to be

117
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,120
t- a two-dimensional null
space, there'll be at least two,

118
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,990
this lambda equals zero
will be repeated twice

119
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,630
because I can find two
independent eigenvectors

120
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,740
with lambda equals zero, and
then of course since it's

121
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,370
got three eigenvalues,
what's the third one?

122
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,300
It's one.

123
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,080
How do I know it's one?

124
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,640
Either from the trace, which is
nine over nine, which is one,

125
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,810
or by remembering what --

126
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,350
what is the eigenvector,
and actually now

127
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,350
it's going to ask
for the eigenvector,

128
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,545
so what's the eigenvector
for that eigenvalue?

129
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,310
What's the eigenvector
for that eigenvalue?

130
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:35,020
It's the -- it's the vector that
doesn't move, eigenvalue one,

131
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,460
so the vector that doesn't move

132
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,630
is a.

133
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,390
This a is the --

134
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:47,040
is -- is also the eigenvector
with lambda equal one,

135
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,250
because if I apply the
projection matrix to a, I get

136
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,290
a again.

137
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,580
Everybody sees that if I apply
that matrix to a, can I do it

138
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,380
in little letters, if I
apply that matrix to a,

139
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,320
then I have a transpose
a canceling a transpose a

140
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,190
and I get a again.

141
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,720
So sure enough, Pa equals a.

142
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,220
And the eigenvalue is one.

143
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,350
OK.

144
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,140
Good.

145
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:22,840
now, actually it asks
you further to solve this

146
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,200
difference equation, so
this will be -- this is --

147
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:36,030
this is solve u(k+1)=Puk,
starting from u0 equal nine,

148
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,655
nine, zero.

149
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,740
And find uk.

150
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,950
So -- so what's up?

151
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,140
Shall we find u1 first of all?

152
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,870
So just to get started.

153
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,780
So what is u1?

154
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,570
It's Pu0 of course.

155
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,480
So if I do the projection of --

156
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,020
of this vector onto the line,
so this is like my vector b now

157
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,070
that I'm projecting
onto the line,

158
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:19,410
I get a times a transpose
u0 over a transpose a.

159
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,080
Well, one way or another I
just do this multiplication.

160
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,100
but maybe this is the
easiest way to do it.

161
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,530
a transpose, can I
remember what a is on

162
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,340
this board?

163
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:37,110
Two, one, two, so I'm projecting
onto the line through there.

164
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,450
This is the projection,
it's P times the vector u0,

165
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,590
so what do I have for a
transpose u0 looks like

166
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,000
eighteen, looks
like twenty-seven,

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,140
and a transpose a
we figured was nine,

168
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:57,790
so it's three a, so that this
is the -- this is the x hat,

169
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,870
the -- the multiple of
a, in -- in our formulas,

170
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,162
and of course that's
six, three, six.

171
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,320
So that's u1.

172
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,500
Computed out directly.

173
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,530
That's on the line through a and
it's the closest point to u0,

174
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,600
and it's just Pu0.

175
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,070
You just straightforward
multiplication produces that.

176
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:23,620
OK.

177
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,300
Now, what's u2?

178
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,310
Well, u2 is Pu1, I agree.

179
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,750
Do I need to compute that again?

180
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:41,730
No, because once I'm already on
the line through A, uk will be,

181
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,220
I could do the
projection k times,

182
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,635
but it's enough
just to do it once.

183
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,570
It's the same, it's the
same, six, three, six.

184
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:59,780
So this is a case
where I could and --

185
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,620
and actually on the quiz
if you see one of these,

186
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:09,360
which could very well be there,
and it could very well be not

187
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:16,120
a projection matrix, then we
would use all the eigenvalues

188
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,940
and eigenvectors.

189
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,790
Let's think for a moment,
how do you do those?

190
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,400
M - the point of this small part
of a question was that when P

191
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,900
is a projection matrix, so that
P squared equals P and P cubed

192
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,600
equals P, then -- then we don't
need to get into the mechanics

193
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,520
of all knowing all the other
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

194
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,670
We just can go directly.

195
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:48,200
But if P was now some other
matrix, can you just --

196
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,140
let's just remember from these
very recent lectures how you

197
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,560
would proceed.

198
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,590
from these very recent lectures
we know that uk we would --

199
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:02,780
we would expand u0 as a
combination of eigenvectors.

200
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,020
Let me leave -- yeah, as a
combination of eigenvectors,

201
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,650
c1x1, some multiple of
the second eigenvector,

202
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,470
some multiple of the
third eigenvector,

203
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:22,320
and then A to the ku0
would be c1, so this --

204
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,270
we have to find these numbers
here, that's the work actually.

205
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,280
The work is find
the eigenvalues,

206
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,500
find the eigenvectors and
find the c-s because they all

207
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,320
come into the formula.

208
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:50,230
We have -- so -- so to do
this, you can see what you have

209
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,280
to compute.

210
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,320
You have to compute
the eigenvalues,

211
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,430
you have to compute
the eigenvectors,

212
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,230
and then to match u0
you compute the c-s,

213
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,210
and then you've got it.

214
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:06,610
So it's -- it's just that's a
formula that shows what pieces

215
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,810
we need.

216
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,550
And what would actually happen
in the case of this projection

217
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,070
matrix?

218
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,310
If this A is a
projection matrix,

219
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,050
then a couple of
eigenvalues are zero.

220
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,200
That's why we just
throw those away.

221
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,780
The other eigenvalue was a one,
so that we got the same thing

222
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,890
every time, c3x3.

223
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,050
From the first
time, second time,

224
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,160
third, all iterations pro-
left us with this constant,

225
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,620
left us right here
at six, three, six.

226
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,220
But maybe I take --

227
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,840
I'm taking this chance
to remind you of what

228
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,900
to do for other matrices.

229
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,600
OK.

230
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,910
So that's part way through.

231
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,460
OK.

232
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,980
The next question in
nineteen eighty-four

233
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,030
is fitting a straight
line to points.

234
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,712
And actually a straight
line through the origin.

235
00:15:04,712 --> 00:15:06,170
A straight line
through the origin.

236
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,120
So can I go to question two?

237
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,360
So this is fitting a straight
line to these points, can I --

238
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:26,580
I'll just give you the points
at t=1 the y is four, at t=2,

239
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,710
y is five, at t=3, y is eight.

240
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:42,630
So we've got points one, two,
three, four, five, and eight.

241
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,720
And I'm trying to fit a
straight line through the origin

242
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,540
to these three values.

243
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:57,170
OK, so my equation that
I'm allowing myself

244
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,950
is just y equal Dt.

245
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,470
So I have only one unknown.

246
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,950
One degree of freedom.

247
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,730
One parameter D.

248
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,510
So I'm expecting to end up
my matrix so my -- my --

249
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,510
when I try to --

250
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,440
when I try to fit a
straight line, that

251
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,660
goes through the origin,
that's because it goes

252
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,570
through the origin, I've
lost the constant c here,

253
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,330
so I have just this should
be a quick calculation.

254
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,590
and I can write down the three
equations that -- that --

255
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,200
that would --

256
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,990
I'd like to solve if the line
went through the points, that's

257
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,080
a good start.

258
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,015
Because that
displays the matrix.

259
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,270
So can I continue that problem?

260
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,760
We would like to solve--

261
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,200
so y is Dt, so I'd like
to solve D times one times

262
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:00,030
D equals four, two times
D equals five and three

263
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,690
times D equals eight.

264
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,500
That would be perfection.

265
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,150
If I could find such
a D, then the line y

266
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,349
equal Dt would satisfy
all three equations,

267
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:16,500
would go through all three
points, but it doesn't exist.

268
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,140
So -- so I have to
solve this -- so the --

269
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,680
my matrix is now you can see my
matrix, it just has one column.

270
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,589
Multiplying a scalar D.

271
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,260
And you can see the
right-hand side.

272
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,500
This is my Ax=b.

273
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,860
I don't need three equals signs
now because I've got vectors.

274
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,620
OK.

275
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,610
There's Ax=b and you
take it from there.

276
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,570
You the -- the best x will
be -- will come from --

277
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,510
so what's the --
the key equation?

278
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:54,960
So this is the A, this is
the Ax hat equal b equation.

279
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,900
Well, Ax=b.

280
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,590
And what's the
equation for x hat?

281
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:08,490
The best D, so to find
the best D, the best x,

282
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:14,660
the equation is A
transpose A, the best D,

283
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:20,900
is A transpose times
the right-hand side.

284
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,340
This is all coming from
projection on a line, our --

285
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,620
our matrix only has one column.

286
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,070
So A transpose A would
be maybe fourteen,

287
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:35,410
D hat, and A transpose
b I'm getting four, ten,

288
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,520
and twenty-four.

289
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,590
Is that right?

290
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,950
Four, ten and twenty-four.

291
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,000
So thirty-eight.

292
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,530
So that tells me the
best D hat is D hat

293
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:52,150
is thirty-eight over fourteen.

294
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,310
OK.

295
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,930
Fine.

296
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,620
All right.

297
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,240
so we found the best line.

298
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,830
And now here's a --
here's the next question.

299
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:07,050
What vector did I just
project onto what line?

300
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:12,210
See in this section on least
squares here's the key point,

301
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:12,740
I'm --

302
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,700
I'm asking you to think
of the least squares

303
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,240
problem in two ways.

304
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,890
Two different pictures.

305
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,080
Two different graphs.

306
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,320
One graph is this.

307
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,060
This is a graph in the -- in the
b -- in the tb plane, ty plane.

308
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,900
The -- the -- the line itself.

309
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,940
The other picture I'm
asking you to think of

310
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,050
is like my projection picture.

311
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,610
What -- what projection --
what -- what vector I --

312
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,940
I projecting onto what line or
what subspace when I -- when I

313
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,050
do this?

314
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,700
So the -- my second picture is
a projection picture that --

315
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,280
that sees the whole
thing with vectors.

316
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,970
Here's my vector of course
that I'm projecting.

317
00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:06,800
I'm projecting that vector b
onto the column space of A.

318
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Of if you like -- it's just
a line onto that's the line

319
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,620
it's just a line, of course.

320
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,070
That's what this
calculation is doing.

321
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,595
This is computing the best D,
which is -- this is the x hat.

322
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,090
So -- so seeing it as a
projection means I don't see

323
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,570
the projection in
this figure, right?

324
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,060
In this figure I'm not
projecting those points

325
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,760
onto that line or
anything of the sort.

326
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,430
The projection s-picture for --
for least squares is in the --

327
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,900
in the space where b
lies, the whole vector b,

328
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,870
and the columns of A.

329
00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:02,570
And then the x is
the best combination

330
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,600
that gives the projection.

331
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,100
OK.

332
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,980
So that's a chance
to tell me that.

333
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,760
OK.

334
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,310
I'll go -- OK now
finally in orthogonality

335
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,610
there's the Graham-Schmidt idea.

336
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:20,230
So that's problem two D here.

337
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,840
It asks me if I have two
vectors, a1 equal one, two,

338
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:32,650
three, and a2 equal
one, one, one, find

339
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:37,650
two orthogonal
vectors in that plane.

340
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:43,480
So those two vectors give
a plane, they give a plane.

341
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,860
Which is of course the --
the column space of the --

342
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,710
of the matrix.

343
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,050
And I'm looking for
an orthogonal basis

344
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:55,710
for that plane.

345
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,300
So I'm looking for two
orthogonal vectors.

346
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,100
And of course there
are lots of --

347
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,330
I mean, I've got a plane there.

348
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,700
If I get one orthogonal
pair, I can rotate it.

349
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,910
There's not just
one answer here.

350
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:16,140
But Graham-Schmidt says OK,
start with the first vector,

351
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,840
and let that be --
and keep that one.

352
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,300
And then take the second
one orthogonal to this.

353
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,400
So -- so Graham-Schmidt says
start with this one and then

354
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,220
make a second vector B, can
I call that second vector B,

355
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,970
this is going to be orthogonal
to, so perpendicular to a1.

356
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:40,650
If I can with my chalk
create the key equation.

357
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:46,740
This vector B is going
to be this one, one, one,

358
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,720
but that one, one -- one, one,
one is not perpendicular to a1,

359
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,340
so I have to subtract
off its projection,

360
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:00,820
I have to subtract off the B,
the -- the B trans- ye the B --

361
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:07,780
the -- the I should say the a1
transpose b over a1 transpose

362
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,400
a1, that multiple of
a1, I've got to remove.

363
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,090
So I just have to
compute what that is,

364
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,440
and I get ano- I get a vector
B that's orthogonal to a1.

365
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,440
It's the -- it's --

366
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,630
it's the original vector
minus its projection.

367
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,110
Oh, so what is --

368
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,490
I mean this to be a2.

369
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,430
So I'm projecting a2
onto the line through a1.

370
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,190
Yeah.

371
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,190
That's the part that I
don't want because that's

372
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,250
in the direction I already
have, so I subtract off

373
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,170
that projection and I
get the part I want,

374
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,240
the orthogonal part.

375
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,540
So that's the
Graham-Schmidt thing

376
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,640
and we can put numbers in.

377
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,370
OK.

378
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:00,710
one, one, one take away
a1 transpose a2 is six,

379
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:06,900
a1 transpose a1 is
fourteen,multiplying a1.

380
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:13,400
And that gives us the
new orthogonal vector B.

381
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,340
Because I only ask for
orthogonal right now,

382
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,200
I don't have to divide
by the length which

383
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,590
will involve a square root.

384
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,210
OK.

385
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:23,940
Third question.

386
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,677
Third question.

387
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:29,510
All right, let me --

388
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,270
I'll move this board up.

389
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:37,930
third question will probably
be about eigenvalues.

390
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,610
OK.

391
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,200
Three.

392
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,020
This is a four-by-four matrix.

393
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,320
Its eigenvalues are lambda
one, lambda two, lambda three,

394
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,310
lambda four.

395
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,930
Question one.

396
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,870
What's the condition
on the lambdas so

397
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,380
that the matrix is invertible?

398
00:24:59,380 --> 00:24:59,990
OK.

399
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,510
So under what conditions
on the lambdas

400
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,900
will the matrix be invertible?

401
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,850
So that's easy.

402
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:17,780
Invertible if what's the
condition on the lambdas?

403
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,370
None of them are zero.

404
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,900
A zero eigenvalue would mean
something in the null space

405
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,850
would mean a solution to
Ax=0x, but we're invertible,

406
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,170
so none of them is
zero, the product --

407
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,120
however you want to say, no --

408
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,510
no zero eigenvalues.

409
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,170
Good.

410
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,200
OK, what's the
determinant of A inverse?

411
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,555
The determinant of A inverse?

412
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,120
So where is that
going to come from?

413
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,470
Well, if we knew the
eigenvalues of A inverse,

414
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,780
we could multiply them together
to find the determinant.

415
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,110
And we do know the
eigenvalues of A inverse.

416
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,370
What are they?

417
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:08,580
They're just one
over lambda one times

418
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,470
one over lambda two, that's
the second eigenvalue,

419
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,640
the third eigenvalue and the

420
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,760
fourth.

421
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,770
So the product of the four
eigenvalues of the inverse

422
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,450
will give us the
determinant of the inverse.

423
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:21,950
Fine.

424
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,110
OK.

425
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:39,600
And what's the
trace of A plus I?

426
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,170
So what do we know about trace?

427
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,510
It's the sum down
the diagonal, but we

428
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,630
don't know what our matrix is.

429
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,960
The trace is also the
sum of the eigenvalues,

430
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,710
and we do know the
eigenvalues of A plus I.

431
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,410
So we just add them up.

432
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:02,520
So what -- what's the first
eigenvalue of A plus I?

433
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,610
When the matrix A has
eigenvalues lambda one, two,

434
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:08,030
three and four,
then the eigenvalues

435
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,610
if I add the identity, that
moves all the eigenvalues

436
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:17,450
by one, so I just add
up lambda one plus one,

437
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:22,520
lambda two plus one, and so on,
lambda three plus one, lambda

438
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,180
four plus one, so it's lambda
one plus lambda two plus lambda

439
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:32,180
three plus lambda
four plus four.

440
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,850
Right.

441
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,110
That movement by the identity
moved all the eigenvalues

442
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:42,290
by one, so it moved the
whole trace by four.

443
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,690
So it was the trace
of A plus four more.

444
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,880
OK.

445
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,240
Let's see.

446
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,600
We may be finished this
quiz twenty minutes early.

447
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,420
No.

448
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,700
There's another question.

449
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,590
Oh, God, OK.

450
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,270
How did this class ever do it?

451
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,710
Well, you'll see.
you'll be able to do it.

452
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,510
OK.

453
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,950
this has got to be a
determinant question.

454
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,290
All right.

455
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:13,810
More determinants and cofactors
and big formula question.

456
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,430
OK.

457
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,760
Let me do that.

458
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,820
So it's about a matrix, a --
a whole family of matrices.

459
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,200
Here's the four-by-four one.

460
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,990
The four-by-four one is, and
-- and all the matrices in this

461
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:35,240
family are tridiagonal with --

462
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,230
with ones.

463
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,110
Otherwise zeroes.

464
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,480
So that's the pattern, and
we've seen this matrix.

465
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,840
OK.

466
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,850
So the -- it's tridiagonal
with ones on the diagonal,

467
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,790
ones above and ones below, and
you see the general formula An,

468
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:58,780
so I'll use Dn for
the determinant of An.

469
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,950
OK.

470
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,990
All right.

471
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,950
So I'm going to do a --

472
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:14,740
the first question is use
cofactors to show that Dn is

473
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:20,680
something times D(n-1) plus
something times D(n-2).

474
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,150
And find those somethings.

475
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:23,650
OK.

476
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:31,020
So this -- the fact that it's
tridiagonal with these constant

477
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:37,290
diagonals means that there
is such a recurrence formula.

478
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,660
And so the first
question is find it.

479
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,810
Well, what's the
recurrence formula?

480
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,550
OK, how does it go?

481
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,390
So I'll use cofactors
along the first row.

482
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:51,570
So I take that number
times its cofactor.

483
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:56,730
So it's one times its cofactor
and what is its cofactor?

484
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,120
D(n-1), right, exactly,
the cofactor is this --

485
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,510
is this guy uses up
row one and column one,

486
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,670
so the cofactor is down
here, so it's one of those.

487
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,550
OK, that's the
first cofactor term.

488
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:17,090
Now the other cofactor
term is this guy.

489
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,740
Which uses up row
one and column two

490
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,870
and what's surprising
about that?

491
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:30,660
When you use row one and column
two that brings in a minus.

492
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,940
There'll be a minus
because the --

493
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:38,490
the cofactor is this
determinant times minus one.

494
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:44,440
The the one-two cofactor is
that determinant with its sign

495
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,460
changed.

496
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:45,960
OK.

497
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,270
So I have to look
at that determinant

498
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,645
and I have to
remember in my head

499
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:50,620
a sign is going to get changed.

500
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,160
OK.

501
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,970
Now how do I do
that determinant?

502
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,180
How do I make that one clear?

503
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,810
I -- the -- the neat way to
do is -- is here I see I --

504
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:05,570
I'll use cofactors
down the first column.

505
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,880
Because the first column is
all zeroes except for that one,

506
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,220
so this one is now --
and what's its cofactor?

507
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,490
Within this three-by-three its
cofactor will be two-by-two,

508
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,080
and what is it?

509
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,970
It's this, right?

510
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,730
So -- so that part is all gone,
so I'm taking that times its

511
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:29,550
cofactor, then zero times
whatever its cofactor is,

512
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:34,040
so it's really just one times
and what's this in the general

513
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,510
n-by-n case?

514
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,420
It's Dn minus two.

515
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,660
But now so is this a plus or
sign or a minus sign, it's --

516
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:48,360
it's just a one, because there's
a one from there and a one from

517
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,050
there.

518
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,930
And is it a plus or a minus?

519
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:56,010
It's minus I guess because
there was a minus the first time

520
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,970
and then the second
time it's a plus,

521
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,240
so it's overall it's a minus.

522
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,864
So there's my a and b
were one and minus one.

523
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,530
Those constants.

524
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,140
Th- that's the --
that's the recurrence.

525
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,220
OK.

526
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:19,180
And oh, then it asks you to then
it asks you to solve this thing

527
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,070
first by writing it as a --

528
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,120
as a system.

529
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,200
So now I'd like to
know the solution.

530
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,600
I -- I better know
how it starts, right?

531
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,020
It starts with D1,
what was D1, that's

532
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:39,550
just the one-by-one case, so
D1 is one, and what is D2?

533
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,880
Just to get us started and
then this would give us

534
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,520
D3, D4, and forever.

535
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,390
D2 is this two-by-two
that I'm seeing here

536
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,620
and that determinant
is obviously zero.

537
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:57,410
So those little ones will start
the recurrence and then we take

538
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,030
off.

539
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:02,070
And then the idea is to
write this recurrence as --

540
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:11,990
as a Dn, D(n-1) is some
matrix times the one before,

541
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,613
the D(n-1), D(n-2).

542
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,270
What's the matrix?

543
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:26,570
You see, you remember this step
of taking a single second order

544
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:31,090
equation and by introducing
a vector unknown to make it

545
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,600
into a --

546
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,600
to a first order system.

547
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,200
OK.

548
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,860
So Dn is one of Dn minus one
minus one, I think that --

549
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,530
that goes in the
first row, right?

550
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,640
From the equation above?

551
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,200
And the second one is
this is the same as this,

552
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,010
so one and zero are fine.

553
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,330
So there's the matrix.

554
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:55,920
OK.

555
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,820
So now how do I proceed?

556
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,590
We can guess what
this examiner's

557
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,845
got in his little mind.

558
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,120
well, find the eigenvalues.

559
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:19,469
And actually it tells
us that the sixth power

560
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:23,679
of these eigenvalues
turns out to be one.

561
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:30,065
Uh, well, can -- can we get the
equation for the eigenvalues?

562
00:34:30,065 --> 00:34:31,940
Let's do it and let's
get a formula for them.

563
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,880
OK.

564
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,260
So what are the eigenvalues?

565
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,590
I look at the -- the matrix,
this determinant one minus

566
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:44,420
lambda and zero minus lambda,
and these guys are still there,

567
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:49,400
I compute that determinant, I
get lambda squared minus lambda

568
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,310
and then plus one.

569
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,820
And I set that to zero.

570
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,820
OK.

571
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,540
So we're not Fibonacci here.

572
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,930
We're -- we're not
seeing Fibonacci numbers.

573
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:07,500
Because the sign -- we
had a sign change there.

574
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,040
And it's not clear right
away whether these --

575
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,380
whether this -- is it clear?

576
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,400
Is this matrix
stable or unstable?

577
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,000
When we take -- when we go
further and further out?

578
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,520
Are these Ds increasing?

579
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,050
Are they going to zero?

580
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,860
Are they bouncing
around periodically?

581
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,600
the answers have to be here.

582
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,840
I would like to know how big
these lambdas are, right?

583
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,880
And the point is probably
these -- let's -- let's see,

584
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,930
what's lambda?

585
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:42,780
From the quadratic
formula lambda is one,

586
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,390
I switch the sign of
that, plus or minus

587
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:50,570
the square root of one minus
4ac, I getting a minus three

588
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:51,970
there?

589
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:52,710
Over two.

590
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,960
What's up?

591
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,340
They're complex.

592
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:08,240
The -- the eigenvalues are one
plus square root of three I

593
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:15,600
over two and one minus square
root of three I over two.

594
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,240
What's the magnitude of lambda?

595
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,765
That's the key
point for stability.

596
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,480
These are two numbers
in the complex plane.

597
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,650
One plus some -- somewhere
here, and its complex conjugate

598
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,820
there.

599
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,580
I want to know how far from
the origin are those numbers.

600
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,840
What's the magnitude of lambda?

601
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,230
And do you see what it is?

602
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,690
Do you recognize this
-- a number like that?

603
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:50,220
Take the real part squared
and the imaginary part squared

604
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,510
and add.

605
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,840
What do you get?

606
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,010
So the real part
squared is a quarter.

607
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,990
The imaginary part
squared is three-quarters.

608
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,200
They add to one.

609
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,090
That's a number with --
that's on the unit circle.

610
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,540
That's an e to the i theta.

611
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,180
That's a cos(theta)+isin(theta).

612
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,650
And what's theta?

613
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:19,330
This -- this is like a complex
number that's worth knowing,

614
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:23,670
it's not totally
obvious but it's nice.

615
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,480
That's -- I should see that
as cos(theta)+isin(theta),

616
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,770
and the angle that would
do that is sixty degrees,

617
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,580
pi over three.

618
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,520
So that's a -- let me
improve my picture.

619
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,990
So those -- that's e
to the i pi over six --

620
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,920
pi over three.

621
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,840
This is -- this number is e
to the i pi over three and e

622
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,840
to the minus i pi over three.

623
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,400
We'll be doing more
complex numbers briefly

624
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,545
but a little more in
the next two days.

625
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,940
next two lectures.

626
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,670
Anyway, the -- so what's
the deal with stability,

627
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,600
what do the Dn-s do?

628
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,570
Well, look, if -- if I take the
sixth power I'm around at one,

629
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,300
the problem actually
told me this.

630
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,950
The sixth power of those
eigenvalues brings me around to

631
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:23,350
What does that tell you about
the matrix, by the way? one.

632
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:26,010
Suppose you know -- this
was a great quiz question,

633
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,510
so I should never have just
said it, but popped out.

634
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:33,600
Suppose lambda one to the sixth
and lambda two to the sixth are

635
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,930
-- are one, which they are.

636
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,090
What does that tell me
about a m- a matrix?

637
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,890
About my matrix A here.

638
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:47,290
Well, what -- what matrix
is connected with lambda one

639
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,180
to the sixth and lambda
two to the sixth?

640
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,890
It's got to be the
matrix A to the sixth.

641
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,700
So what is A to the
sixth for that matrix?

642
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,170
It's got eigenvalues
one and one.

643
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:04,720
Because when I take the
sixth power, actually, ye,

644
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,610
if I take the sixth power b- all
the sixth power of that is one

645
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,990
and the sixth power of that is
one, the sixth power of this

646
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,660
is e to the two pi i, that's
one, the sixth power of this

647
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,330
is e to the minus
two pi i, that's one.

648
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:24,190
So the sixth powers, the -- the
sixth power of that matrix has

649
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,850
eigenvalues one and
one, so what is it?

650
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,400
It's the identity, right.

651
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,940
So if I operate this -- if
I run this thing six times,

652
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,930
I'm back where I was.

653
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:39,340
The sixth power of that
matrix is the identity.

654
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,550
Good.

655
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,670
OK.

656
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,890
So it'll loop around, it's
-- it doesn't go to zero,

657
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:49,080
it doesn't blow up, it just
periodically goes around with

658
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,360
period six.

659
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,460
OK.

660
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,440
let's just see if there's a --

661
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,095
all right.

662
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,020
I'll -- let's see.

663
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,250
Could I also look at a --

664
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,155
at a final exam from
nineteen ninety-two.

665
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:11,570
I think that's yeah, let me
do that on this last board.

666
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,080
It starts -- a lot of the
questions in this exam are

667
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,760
about a family of matrices.

668
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,300
Let me give you the fourth, the
fourth guy in the family is --

669
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,880
has a one, so it's
zeroes on the diagonal,

670
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,130
but these are going one,
two, three and so on.

671
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:37,420
One, two, three, and so on.

672
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:42,190
But, for the four-by-four
case I'm stopping at four.

673
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:47,070
You see the pattern?

674
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,670
It's a family of matrices
which is growing,

675
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,760
and actually the numbers
-- it's symmetric, right,

676
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,490
it's equal to A4 transpose.

677
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,880
And we can ask all sorts of
questions about its null space,

678
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:07,030
its range, r- its column
space find the projection

679
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:12,330
matrix onto the column space
of A3, for example, is in here.

680
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:21,730
So -- so one -- so A3 is zero,
one, zero, one, zero, two,

681
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,100
zero, two, zero.

682
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,900
OK, find the projection
matrix onto the column space.

683
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,540
By the way, is that matrix
singular or invertible?

684
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,310
Singular.

685
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:45,750
Why do we know it's singular?

686
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,500
I see that column three is
a multiple of column one.

687
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,090
Or we could take
its determinant.

688
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,730
So it's certainly singular.

689
00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:00,200
The projection will be
matrix will be three-by-three

690
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,190
but it will project
onto the column space,

691
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,610
it'll project onto this plane.

692
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,240
The column space of A3, and
I guess I would find it from

693
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,100
the formula AA --

694
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,120
AA transpose A inverse,
I would have to --

695
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,120
I would -- I guess
I would do all this.

696
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:23,050
There may be a
better way, perhaps

697
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,700
I could think there might
be a slightly quicker way,

698
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,390
but that would come
out pretty fast.

699
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,450
OK.

700
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:31,260
So that's be the
projection matrix.

701
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,360
Next question.

702
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,010
Find the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of that matrix.

703
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,020
OK.

704
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,590
There's a three-by-three
matrix, oh, yeah,

705
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,560
so what are its eigenvalues
and eigenvectors,

706
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,840
we haven't done any
three-by-threes.

707
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,070
Let's do one.

708
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,770
I want to find, so how
do I find eigenvalues?

709
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:53,280
I take the determinant
of A3 minus lambda I.

710
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,200
So this is you just have to --
so I'm subtracting lambda from

711
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,650
the diagonal, and I have a
one, one, zero, zero, two,

712
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:07,200
two there, and I just have
to find that determinant.

713
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,030
OK, since it's three-by-three
I'll just go for it.

714
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:16,850
This way gives me minus lambda
cubed and a zero and zero.

715
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:20,060
Then in this direction which
has the minus sign, that's

716
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:25,090
a zero, four lambdas, I
mean minus four lambdas,

717
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:29,110
and minus another lambda, so
that's minus five lambdas,

718
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:32,550
but that direction
goes with a minus sign,

719
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:36,850
so I think it's
plus five lambda.

720
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:40,330
That looks like the determinant
of A3 minus lambda I,

721
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,030
so I set it to zero.

722
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,520
So what are the eigenvalues?

723
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,950
Well, lambda equals zero --
lambda factors out of this,

724
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:52,790
times minus lambda
squared plus four,

725
00:43:52,790 --> 00:44:03,610
so the eigenvalues are
five, thanks, thanks,

726
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:08,470
so the eigenvalues are
zero, square root of five,

727
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,410
and minus square root of five.

728
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,970
And I would never write
down those three eigenvalues

729
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,120
without checking the
trace to tell the truth.

730
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,520
Because -- because we did a
bunch of calculations here

731
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,990
but then I can quickly add up
the eigenvalues to get zero,

732
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:27,270
add up the trace to get
zero, and feel that I'm --

733
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,510
well, I guess that wouldn't have
caught my error if I'd made it

734
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:34,280
-- if -- if that had been a
four I wouldn't have noticed,the

735
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,660
determinant isn't anything
greatly useful here, right,

736
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,310
because the determinant
is just zero.

737
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,190
And so I never would
know whether that five

738
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:48,990
was right or wrong, but
thanks for making it right.

739
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:49,490
OK.

740
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,380
Ha.

741
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:00,760
Question two c, whoever
wrote this, probably me,

742
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,270
said this is not difficult.

743
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:06,570
I don't know why I put that in.

744
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,640
just -- it asks for the
projection matrix onto

745
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,050
the column space of A4.

746
00:45:15,402 --> 00:45:17,360
How could I have thought
that wasn't difficult?

747
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:25,580
It looks extremely difficult.
what's the projection matrix

748
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,505
onto the column space of A4?

749
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,680
I don't know whether that --
this is not difficult is just

750
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,650
like helpful or -- or insulting.

751
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:41,380
Uh, what do you think?

752
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,870
The -- what's the
column space of A4 here?

753
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:52,800
Well, what's our first question
is is the matrix singular

754
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,280
or invertible?

755
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,210
If the answer is invertible,
then what's the column space?

756
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:03,820
If -- if this matrix A4 is
invertible, so that's my guess,

757
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,200
if this problem's easy it has
to be because this matrix is

758
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,600
probably invertible.

759
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,940
Then its column
space is R^4, good,

760
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,260
the column space
is the whole space,

761
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,320
and the answer to this easy
question is the projection

762
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:23,180
matrix is the identity, it's the
four-by-four identity matrix.

763
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,130
If this matrix is invertible.

764
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,510
Shall we check invertibility?

765
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:29,840
How would you find
its determinant?

766
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,770
Can we just like take the
determinant of that matrix?

767
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:37,010
I could ask you how -- so there
-- there are twenty-four terms,

768
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,950
do we want to write all
twenty-four terms down?

769
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,470
not in the remaining
ten seconds.

770
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,930
Better to use cofactors.

771
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:47,890
So I go along row
one, I see one --

772
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:52,060
the only nonzero is this guy,
so I should take that one times

773
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,380
the cofactor.

774
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,680
Now so I'm down to
this determinant.

775
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,640
OK.

776
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,970
So now I'm -- look at this first
column, I see one times this,

777
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:05,640
there's the cofactor of the
one, so I'm using up row one --

778
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,530
row one and column one of
this three-by-three matrix,

779
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,060
I'm down to this
cofactor, and by the way,

780
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,370
those were both
plus signs, right?

781
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,410
No, they weren't.

782
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,240
That was a minus sign.

783
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,490
That was a --

784
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:22,540
that was a minus, and then that
was a plus, and then this, so

785
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,670
what's the determinant?

786
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,400
Nine.

787
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:25,900
Nine.

788
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,960
Determinant is nine.

789
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,190
Determinant of A4 is nine.

790
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,580
OK.

791
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:38,640
Where A3, so my guess is I'll
put that on the final this

792
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,320
year, the -- probably the odd-
numbered ones are singular

793
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,830
and the even-numbered
ones are invertible.

794
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:50,710
And I don't know
what the determinants

795
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:55,750
are but I'm betting that
they have some nice formula.

796
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,290
OK.

797
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:02,770
So, recitations this week
will also be quiz review

798
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:08,740
and then the quiz is
Wednesday at one o'clock.

799
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,290
Thanks.
