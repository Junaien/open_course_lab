1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,590
-- and lift-off on
differential equations.

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,660
So, this section is
about how to solve

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,760
a system of first order,
first derivative, constant

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,500
coefficient linear equations.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,740
And if we do it right, it turns
directly into linear algebra.

6
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,690
The key idea is the solutions
to constant coefficient

7
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,730
linear equations
are exponentials.

8
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,520
So if you look for
an exponential,

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,230
then all you have to find is
what's up there in the exponent

10
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,060
and what multiplies
the exponential

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,130
and that's the linear algebra.

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,950
So -- and the result --
one thing we will fine --

13
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,380
it's completely parallel
to powers of a matrix.

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,090
So the last lecture was
about how would you compute

15
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,680
A to the K or A to the 100?

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,120
How do you compute high
powers of a matrix?

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,590
Now it's not powers anymore,
but it's exponentials.

18
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,310
That's the natural thing
for differential equation.

19
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,810
Okay.

20
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,730
But can I begin with an example?

21
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,630
And I'll just go
through the mechanics.

22
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,700
How would I solve
the differential --

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,707
two differential equations?

24
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:34,790
So I'm going to make it --

25
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,160
I'll have a two by two
matrix and the coefficients

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,530
are minus one two, one minus
two and I'd better give you

27
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,200
some initial condition.

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,570
So suppose it starts u at
times zero -- this is u1, u2 --

29
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,810
let it -- let it --

30
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,150
suppose everything is
in u1 at times zero.

31
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,890
So -- at -- at the
start, it's all in u1.

32
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:07,640
But what happens as time
goes on, du2/dt will --

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,690
will be positive,
because of that u1 term,

34
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:16,210
so flow will move into the u2
component and it will go out

35
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,050
of the u1 component.

36
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,330
So we'll just follow
that movement as time

37
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:28,260
goes forward by looking at the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

38
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,220
of that matrix.

39
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,430
That's a first job.

40
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,210
Before you do anything
else, find the --

41
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:39,510
find the matrix and its
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

42
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,400
So let me do that.

43
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,060
Okay.

44
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,440
So here's our matrix.

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,500
Maybe you can tell
me right away what --

46
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,190
what are the eigenvalues
and -- eigenvalues anyway.

47
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,640
And then we can check.

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,070
But can you spot any of the
eigenvalues of that matrix?

49
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,900
We're looking for
two eigenvalues.

50
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,090
Do you see --

51
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,530
I mean, if I just wrote
that matrix down, what --

52
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,670
what do you notice about it?

53
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,490
It's singular, right.

54
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,380
That -- that's a
singular matrix.

55
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,190
That tells me right away
that one of the eigenvalues

56
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,860
is lambda equals zero.

57
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,900
I can -- that's a
singular matrix,

58
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,440
the second column is minus
two times the first column,

59
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,600
the determinant is zero,
it's -- it's singular,

60
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,670
so zero is an eigenvalue and
the other eigenvalue will be --

61
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,640
from the trace.

62
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,510
I look at the
trace, the sum down

63
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,620
the diagonal is minus three.

64
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,770
That has to agree with
the sum of the eigenvalue,

65
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,970
so that second eigenvalue
better be minus three.

66
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,610
I could, of course --

67
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,100
I could compute -- why
don't I over here --

68
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,530
compute the determinant
of A minus lambda I,

69
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:01,220
the determinant of this minus
one minus lambda two one minus

70
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,680
two minus lambda matrix.

71
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,930
But we know what's coming.

72
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,700
When I do that multiplication,
I get a lambda squared.

73
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,200
I get a two lambda and a one
lambda, that's a three lambda.

74
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,750
And then -- now I'm going
to get the determinant,

75
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,910
which is two minus
two which is zero.

76
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:26,490
So there's my characteristic
polynomial, this determinant.

77
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,960
And of course I factor that into
lambda times lambda plus three

78
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,590
and I get the two eigenvalues
that we saw coming.

79
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,830
What else do I need?

80
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,320
The eigenvectors.

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,020
So before I even think about the
differential equation or what

82
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,780
-- how to solve it, let me
find the eigenvectors for this

83
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,910
matrix.

84
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,430
Okay.

85
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,970
So take lambda equals zero --

86
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,370
so that -- that's
the first eigenvalue.

87
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,690
Lambda one equals zero
and the second eigenvalue

88
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,130
will be lambda two
equals minus three.

89
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,210
By the way, I --

90
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,010
I already know something
important about this.

91
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,920
The eigenvalues are
telling me something.

92
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,820
You'll see how it comes
out, but let me point to --

93
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,640
these numbers are
-- this eigenvalue,

94
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,700
a negative eigenvalue,
is going to disappear.

95
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,620
There's going to be an e to the
minus three t in the answer.

96
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,690
That e to the minus
three t as times goes on

97
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,070
is going to be very, very small.

98
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,360
The other part of the
answer will involve an e

99
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,390
to the zero t.

100
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:44,330
But e to the zero t is
one and that's a constant.

101
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:49,190
So I'm expecting that this
solution'll have two parts,

102
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,570
an e to the zero t part and an
e to the minus three t part,

103
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,900
and that -- and as time goes
on, the second part'll disappear

104
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,360
and the first part
will be a steady

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,030
It won't move. state.

106
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,740
It will be -- at the end of
-- as t approaches infinity,

107
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,800
this part disappears
and this is the --

108
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,330
the e to the zero t
part is what I get.

109
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,120
And I'm very interested in these
steady states, so that's --

110
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,330
I get a steady state
when I have a zero

111
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,150
eigenvalue.

112
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,650
Okay.

113
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,950
What about those eigenvectors?

114
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,170
So what's the eigenvector that
goes with eigenvalue zero?

115
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:26,670
Okay.

116
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,280
The matrix is singular as
it is, the eigenvector is --

117
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,940
is the guy in the null space,
so what vector is in the null

118
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,890
space of that matrix?

119
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,860
Let's see.

120
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,900
I guess I probably give the
free variable the value one

121
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,630
and I realize that if I want to
get zero I need a two up here.

122
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,260
Okay?

123
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,560
So Ax1 is zero x1.

124
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,550
A x1 is zero x1.

125
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,370
Fine.

126
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,520
Okay.

127
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
What about the other eigenvalue?

128
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,801
Lambda two is minus three.

129
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:02,300
Okay.

130
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,010
How do I get the other
eigenvalue, then?

131
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,080
For the moment --
can I mentally do it?

132
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,850
I subtract minus three
along the diagonal,

133
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,070
which means I add three --

134
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,370
can I -- I'll just do it with an
erase -- erase for the moment.

135
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,950
So I'm going to add
three to the diagonal.

136
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:26,040
So this minus one will
become a two and --

137
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,450
I'll make it in big
loopy letters --

138
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,350
and when I add three to this
guy, the minus two becomes --

139
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,200
well, I can't make one
very loopy, but how's that?

140
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,410
Okay.

141
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,200
Now that's A minus three I --

142
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,540
A plus three I, sorry.

143
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,400
That's A plus three I.

144
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,510
It's supposed to
be singular, right?

145
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,260
I-- if things --
if I did it right,

146
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,930
this matrix should be
singular and the x2,

147
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,521
the eigenvector should
be in its null space.

148
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:56,020
Okay.

149
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,510
What do I get for the
null space of this?

150
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:02,140
Maybe minus one one,
or one minus one.

151
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,240
Doesn't matter.

152
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,300
Those are both perfectly good.

153
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,800
Right?

154
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,550
Because that's in the
null space of this.

155
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:14,370
Now I'll -- because A times
that vector is three times that

156
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,600
vector.

157
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,370
Ax2 is minus three x2.

158
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,540
Good.

159
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,040
Okay.

160
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,380
Can I get A again so
we see that correctly?

161
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,680
That was a minus one and
that was a minus two.

162
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,730
Good.

163
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,809
Okay.

164
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,470
That -- that's the first job.

165
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,970
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

166
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,179
And already the
eigenvalues are telling me

167
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,240
the most important
information about the answer.

168
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,540
But now, what is the answer?

169
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:54,420
The answer is -- the
solution will be U of T --

170
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,920
okay.

171
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,750
Now, wh- now I use those
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

172
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,210
The solution is some --
there are two eigenvalues.

173
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,100
So I -- it -- so there're going
to be two special solutions

174
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,910
here.

175
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,040
Two pure exponential solutions.

176
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,300
The first one is going to
be either the lambda one tx1

177
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:23,440
and the -- so that solves the
equation, and so does this one.

178
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,290
They both are solutions to
the differential equation.

179
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,640
That's the general solution.

180
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,900
The general solution
is a combination

181
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,010
of that pure
exponential solution

182
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,630
and that pure
exponential solution.

183
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,150
Can I just see that those
guys do solve the equation?

184
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,540
So let me just check -- check
on this one, for example.

185
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,360
I -- I want to check that
the -- my equation --

186
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,860
let's

187
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,190
Check. remember, the
equation -- du/dt is Au.

188
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:04,340
I plug in e to the
lambda one t x1

189
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,470
and let's just see that
the equation's okay.

190
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,370
I believe this is a
solution to that equation.

191
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,980
So just plug it in.

192
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,870
On the left-hand side, I
take the time derivative --

193
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,700
so the left-hand side will be
lambda one, e to the lambda one

194
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,540
t x1, right?

195
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,990
The time derivative -- this is
the term that depends on time,

196
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,250
it's just ordinary exponential,
its derivative brings down

197
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,470
a lambda one.

198
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,460
On the other side of the
equation it's A times this

199
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,380
thing.

200
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:44,790
A times either the lambda one t
x one, and does that check out?

201
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,550
Do we have equality there?

202
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,190
Yes, because either the lambda
one t appears on both sides

203
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:58,030
and the other one is Ax1
equal lambda one x1 -- check.

204
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:02,590
Do you -- so, the -- we've come
to the first point to remember.

205
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,030
These pure solutions.

206
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:10,760
Those pure solutions are the
-- those pure exponentials are

207
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,280
the differential
equations analogue of --

208
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,040
last time we had pure powers.

209
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,540
Last time -- so --

210
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,200
so last time, the
analog was lambda --

211
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,020
lambda one to the K-th power
x1, some amount of that,

212
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:35,130
plus some amount of lambda
two to the K-th power x2.

213
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,590
That was our formula
from last time.

214
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,690
I put it up just to -- so
your eye compares those two

215
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,880
formulas.

216
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,550
Powers of lambda in the --

217
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,610
in the difference equation
-- that -- this was in the --

218
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:55,480
this was for the equation
uk plus one equals A uk.

219
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,890
That was for the finite
step -- stepping by one.

220
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,330
And we got powers,
now this is the one

221
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,920
we're interested in,
the exponentials.

222
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,750
So -- so that's --
that's the solution --

223
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,660
what are c1 and c2?

224
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,300
Then we're through.

225
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,060
What are c1 and c2?

226
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,340
Well, of course we know
these actual things.

227
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,260
Let me just -- let
me come back to this.

228
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,790
c1 is -- we haven't figured out
yet, but e to the lambda one t,

229
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:32,890
the lambda one is zero so that's
just a one times x1 which is

230
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,260
two one.

231
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:39,590
So it's c1 times this one that's
not moving times the vector,

232
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,660
the eigenvector two
one and c2 times --

233
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,730
what's e to the lambda two t?

234
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,830
Lambda two is minus three.

235
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,010
So this is the term
that has the minus

236
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,360
three t and its eigenvector
is this one minus one.

237
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,640
So this vector
solves the equation

238
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,580
and any multiple of it.

239
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,190
This vector solves the equation
if it's got that factor

240
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,620
e to the minus three t.

241
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,980
We've got the answer
except for c1 and c2.

242
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,970
So -- so everything I've done
is immediate as soon as you know

243
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,570
the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors.

244
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,640
So how do we get c1 and c2?

245
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,930
That has to come from
the initial condition.

246
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:38,740
So now I -- now I use -- u
of zero is given as one zero.

247
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,346
So this is the initial condition
that will find c1 and c2.

248
00:13:46,346 --> 00:13:48,095
So let me do that on
the board underneath.

249
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,935
At t equals zero, then --

250
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:05,280
I get c1 times this guy plus
c2 and now I'm at times zero.

251
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,320
So that's a one and
this is a one minus one

252
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,920
and that's supposed to agree
with u of zero one zero.

253
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,850
Okay.

254
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,090
That should be two equations.

255
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,500
That should give me c1 and
c2 and then I'm through.

256
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,540
So what are c1 and c2?

257
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,430
Let's see.

258
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,000
I guess we could
actually spot them by eye

259
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,800
or we could solve two
equations in two unknowns.

260
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,090
Let's see.

261
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,940
If these were both ones
-- so I'm just adding --

262
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,630
then I would get three zero.

263
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,740
So what's the -- what's
the solution, then?

264
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,910
If -- if c1 and c2 are both
ones, I get three zero,

265
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,990
so I want, like,
one third of that,

266
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,750
because I want to get one zero.

267
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,220
So I think it's c1 equals
a third, c2 equals a third.

268
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,030
So finally I have the answer.

269
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,000
Let me keep it in the
-- in this board here.

270
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:20,530
Finally the answer is one third
of this plus one third of this.

271
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,990
Do you see what -- what's
actually happening with this

272
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,880
flow?

273
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,630
This flow started out at --
the solution started out at one

274
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,140
zero.

275
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,790
Started at one zero.

276
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,290
Then as time went on,
people moved, essentially.

277
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:46,190
Some fraction of
this one moved here.

278
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:52,030
And -- and in the limit, there's
-- there's the limit, as --

279
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,530
right?

280
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,540
As t goes to infinity,
as t gets very large,

281
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,110
this disappears and this
is the steady state.

282
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,550
So the steady state is --

283
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,272
so the steady state --

284
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:14,190
u -- we could call it u at
infinity is one third of two

285
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,040
and one.

286
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,110
It's -- it's two
thirds of one third.

287
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,790
So that's the -- we really --

288
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,280
I mean, you're
getting, like, total,

289
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,790
insight into the
behavior of the solution,

290
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,050
what the differential
equation does.

291
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:37,480
Of course, we don't -- wouldn't
always have a steady state.

292
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,580
Sometimes we would
approach zero.

293
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,320
Sometimes we would blow up.

294
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,250
Can we straighten
out those cases?

295
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,510
The eigenvalue should tell us.

296
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,170
So when do we get --

297
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,440
so -- so let me ask first,
when do we get stability?

298
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,250
That's u of t going to zero.

299
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,660
When would the solution
go to zero no matter

300
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,230
what the initial condition is?

301
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,140
Negative eigenvalues, right.

302
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,609
Negative eigenvalues.

303
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,630
But now I have to --

304
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,950
I have to ask you
for one more step.

305
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,420
Suppose the eigenvalues
are complex numbers?

306
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,680
Because we know they could be.

307
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,760
Then we want stability --
this -- this -- we want --

308
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:35,260
we need all these e to the
lambda t-s all going to zero

309
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,920
and somehow that asks us
to have lambda negative.

310
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,470
But suppose lambda
is a complex number?

311
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,690
Then what's the test?

312
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,340
What -- if lambda's a
complex number like, oh,

313
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,730
suppose lambda is negative
plus an imaginary part?

314
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,810
Say lambda is minus
three plus six i?

315
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,120
What -- what happens then?

316
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,530
Can we just, like,
do a -- a case here?

317
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:11,550
If -- if this lambda is
minus three plus six it,

318
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,170
how big is that number?

319
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,450
Does this -- does this imaginary
part play a -- play a --

320
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,840
play a role here or not?

321
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,850
Or how big is --

322
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,700
what's the absolute value
of that -- of that quantity?

323
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,670
It's just e to the
minus three t, right?

324
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,880
Because this other part, this --
the -- the magnitude -- the --

325
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,795
this -- e to the six it -- what
-- that has absolute value one.

326
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,180
Right?

327
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:50,540
That's just this cosine of
six t plus i, sine of six t.

328
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,060
And the absolute
value squared will

329
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,230
be cos squared plus sine
squared will be one.

330
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,680
This is -- this complex number
is running around the unit

331
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,660
circle.

332
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,770
This com- this -- the -- it's
the real part that matters.

333
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,020
This is what I'm trying to do.

334
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,980
Real part of lambda
has to be negative.

335
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,880
If lambda's a complex
number, it's the real part,

336
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,200
the minus three, that
either makes us go to zero

337
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,940
or doesn't, or let
-- or blows up.

338
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,380
The imaginary part won't
-- will just, like,

339
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,690
oscillate between
the two components.

340
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,360
Okay.

341
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,230
So that's stability.

342
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,040
And what about --

343
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,305
what about a steady state?

344
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,490
When would we have,
a steady state,

345
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,390
always in the same direction?

346
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,160
So let me --

347
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,280
I'll take this part away --

348
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,280
when -- so that was, like,
checking that it's --

349
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,830
that it's the real part
that we care about.

350
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,530
Now, we have a
steady state when --

351
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:12,500
when lambda one is zero and the
other eigenvalues have what?

352
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,990
So I'm looking -- like,
that example was, like,

353
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,910
perfect for a steady state.

354
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,760
We have a zero eigenvalue
and the other eigenvalues,

355
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,070
we want those to disappear.

356
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,975
So the other eigenvalues
have real part negative.

357
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,700
And we blow up, for sure --

358
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:45,380
we blow up if any real
part of lambda is positive.

359
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:54,240
So if I -- if I reverse the
sign of A -- of the matrix A --

360
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,420
suppose instead of the matrix
I had, the A that I had,

361
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,390
I changed it --

362
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,770
I changed all its sines.

363
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:04,950
What would that do to the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors?

364
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,090
If I -- if -- if I know the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

365
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,520
of A, tell me about minus A.

366
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,780
What happens to the eigenvalues?

367
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,410
For minus A, they'll
all change sine.

368
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,660
So I'll have blow up.

369
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,020
This -- instead of the
e to the minus three t,

370
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,460
if I change that to minus --
if I change the sines in that

371
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,810
matrix, I would change
the trace to plus three,

372
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,020
I would have an e to the plus
three t and I would have blow

373
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,150
up.

374
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,430
Of course the zero eigenvalue
would stay at zero,

375
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,490
but the other guy
is taking off in --

376
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,091
if I reversed all the sines.

377
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:45,590
Okay.

378
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:51,090
So this is -- this is
the stability picture.

379
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:56,680
And for a two by two
matrix, we can actually

380
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,220
pin down even more
closely what that means.

381
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,710
Can I -- let -- can I do that?

382
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,410
Let me do that --

383
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,810
I want to --

384
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:11,230
for a two by two matrix, I
can tell whether the real part

385
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,740
of the eigenvalues is
negative, I -- well, let me --

386
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,480
let me tell you what I
have in mind for that.

387
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,040
So two by two stability --

388
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,750
let me -- this is
just a little comment.

389
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,506
Two by two stability.

390
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,930
So my matrix, now,
is just a b c d

391
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:41,770
and I'm looking for the real
parts of both eigenvalues

392
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,910
to be negative.

393
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:47,980
Okay.

394
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,300
What -- how can I tell
from looking at the matrix,

395
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,230
without computing
its eigenvalues,

396
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,150
whether the two
eigenvalues are negative,

397
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,930
or at least their real
parts are negative?

398
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,260
What would that tell
me about the trace?

399
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,830
So -- so the trace --

400
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,930
that's this a plus d --

401
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,470
what can you tell me about
the trace in the case of a two

402
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,760
by two stable matrix?

403
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,320
That means the eigenvalues
have -- are negative,

404
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,660
or at least the real parts of
those eigenvalues are negative

405
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,140
-- then, when I take the -- when
I look at the matrix and find

406
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,930
its trace, what -- what
do I know about that?

407
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,360
It's negative, right.

408
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,940
This is the sum of
the -- this equals --

409
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:47,010
this equals lambda one plus
lambda two, so it's negative.

410
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,590
The two eigenvalues, by
the way, will have --

411
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:54,990
if they're complex -- will have
plus six i and minus six i.

412
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,860
The complex parts will -- will
be conjugates of each other

413
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,720
and disappear when we add and
the trace will be negative.

414
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,710
Okay, the trace
has to be negative.

415
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,030
Is that enough --

416
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:14,670
is a negative trace enough
to make the matrix stable?

417
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,180
Shouldn't be enough, right?

418
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,270
Can I -- can you make -- what's
a matrix that has a negative

419
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:24,040
trace but still it's not stable?

420
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,500
So it -- it has a blow -- it
still has a blow-up factor

421
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,900
and a -- and a --
and a decaying one.

422
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,820
So what would be a -- so
just -- just to see --

423
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,920
maybe I just put that here.

424
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,790
This -- now I'm looking for an
example where the trace could

425
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:48,080
be negative but still blow up.

426
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,830
Of course -- yeah,
let's just take one.

427
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:57,990
Oh, look, let me -- let me make
it minus two zero zero one.

428
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,140
Okay.

429
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,810
There's a case where that
matrix has negative trace --

430
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,390
I know its
eigenvalues of course.

431
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,750
They're minus two and
one and it blows up.

432
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,780
It's got -- it's got a
plus one eigenvalue here,

433
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,280
so there would be an e to
the plus t in the solution

434
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,170
and it'll blow up if it has
any second component at all.

435
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,900
I need another condition.

436
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,615
And it's a condition
on the determinant.

437
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,560
And what's that condition?

438
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,730
If I know that the
two eigenvalues --

439
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,090
suppose I know they're
negative, both negative.

440
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,790
What does that tell me
about the determinant?

441
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,260
Let me ask again.

442
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,990
If I know both the
eigenvalues are negative,

443
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,760
then I know the
trace is negative

444
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,170
but the determinant is
positive, because it's

445
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,450
the product of the
two eigenvalues.

446
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,580
So this determinant is
lambda one times lambda two.

447
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,540
This is -- this is lambda
one times lambda two

448
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,060
and if they're both negative,
the product is positive.

449
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,860
So positive determinant,
negative trace.

450
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:17,200
I can easily track down the --
this condition also for the --

451
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,380
if -- if there's an imaginary
part hanging around.

452
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,880
Okay.

453
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,550
So that's a -- like a
small but quite useful,

454
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,820
because two by two is
always important --

455
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,100
comment on stability.

456
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,750
Okay.

457
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:40,170
So let's just look
at the picture again.

458
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,290
Okay.

459
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,980
The main part of my
lecture, the one thing

460
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,700
you want to be able to,
like, just do automatically

461
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,750
is this step of
solving the system.

462
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,190
Find the eigenvalues,
find the eigenvectors,

463
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,000
find the coefficients.

464
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,090
And notice -- what's the matrix
-- in this linear system here,

465
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:05,590
I can't help -- if I -- if I
have equations like that --

466
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,900
that's my equations
column at a time --

467
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,710
what's the matrix
form of that equation?

468
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:18,580
So -- so this -- this
system of equations is --

469
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:26,710
is some matrix multiplying
c1, c2 to give u of zero.

470
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,370
One zero.

471
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,510
What's the matrix?

472
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,400
Well, it's obviously
two one, one minus one,

473
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,760
but we have a name, or
at least a letter --

474
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,090
actually a name for that matrix.

475
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,670
Wh- what matrix
are we s- are we --

476
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:47,390
are we dealing with here in
this step of finding the c-s?

477
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,690
Its letter is S --

478
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,340
it's the eigenvector matrix.

479
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:52,970
Of course.

480
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,230
These are the
eigenvectors, there

481
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,150
in the columns of our matrix.

482
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:02,520
So this is S c
equals u of zero --

483
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:09,640
is the -- that step where you
find the actual coefficients,

484
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,690
you find out how much of
each pure exponential is

485
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,910
in the solution.

486
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:20,660
By getting it right at the
start, then it stays right

487
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,320
forever.

488
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,820
I -- you're seeing this
picture that each --

489
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,090
each pure exponential goes on
its own way once you start it

490
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:29,620
from u of

491
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,490
zero.

492
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,810
So you start it by
figuring out how much

493
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,880
each one is present in u of
zero and then off they go.

494
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,740
Okay.

495
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:45,110
So -- so that's a system of
two equations in two unknowns

496
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,070
coupled --

497
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:53,630
the matrix sort of couples
u1 and u2 and the eigenvalues

498
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,770
and eigenvectors uncouple
it, diagonalize it.

499
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,830
Actually -- okay, now can I --

500
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,600
can I think in terms
of S and lambda?

501
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,330
So I want to write
the solution down,

502
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,840
again in terms of S and lambda.

503
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,340
Okay.

504
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,890
I'll do that on this far board.

505
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:15,890
Okay.

506
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:20,540
So I'm coming back to --

507
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:26,470
I'm coming back to our
equation du/dt equals Au.

508
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:35,890
Now this matrix A couples them.

509
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,010
The whole point of
eigenvectors is to uncouple.

510
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:46,510
So one way to see that is
introduce set u equal A --

511
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,010
not

512
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:54,580
A. It's S, the eigenvector
matrix that uncouples it.

513
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,890
So I'm -- I'm taking this
equation as I'm given,

514
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:04,150
coupled with -- with A has --
is probably full of non-zeroes,

515
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,130
but I'm -- by uncoupling it,
I mean I'm diagonalizing it.

516
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,630
If I can get a
diagonal matrix, I'm --

517
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,470
I'm in.

518
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,120
Okay.

519
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,950
So I plug that in.

520
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,720
This is A S v.

521
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,813
And this is S dv/dt.

522
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,890
S is a constant.

523
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,050
It's -- this it the
eigenvector matrix.

524
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,635
This is the eigenvector matrix.

525
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,330
Okay.

526
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,550
Now I'm going to bring
S inverse over here.

527
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,285
And what have I got?

528
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:53,470
That combination S inverse A S
is lambda, the diagonal matrix.

529
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,940
That's -- that's the
point, that in --

530
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,400
if I'm using the
eigenvectors as my basis,

531
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,700
then my system of
equations is just diagonal.

532
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,420
I -- each -- there's
no coupling anymore --

533
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,130
dv1/dt is lambda one v1.

534
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:20,890
So let's just write that
down. dv1/ dt is lambda one v1

535
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:26,470
and so on for all
n of the equations.

536
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,610
It's a system of equations
but they're not connected,

537
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:32,865
so they're easy to solve
and why don't I just

538
00:31:32,865 --> 00:31:33,865
write down the solution?

539
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:47,160
v -- well, v is now some
e to the lambda one t --

540
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,600
well, okay --

541
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,330
I guess my idea here now is to
use, the natural notation --

542
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:04,740
v of T is e to the
lambda tv of zero.

543
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:16,150
And u of t will be Se to the
lambda t S inverse, u of zero.

544
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:20,990
This is the -- this is the,
formula I'm headed for.

545
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,530
This -- this matrix, S e
to the lambda t S inverse,

546
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,040
that's my exponential.

547
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:40,483
That's my e to the A t, is this
S e to the lambda t S inverse.

548
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,310
So my -- my job really now is
to explain what's going on with

549
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,620
this matrix up in
the exponential.

550
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,610
What does that mean?

551
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,110
What does it mean to
say e to a matrix?

552
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,680
This ought to be easier because
this is e to a diagonal matrix,

553
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,970
but still it's a matrix.

554
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,350
What do we mean by e to the A t?

555
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:13,120
Because really e to the
A t is my answer here.

556
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,620
My -- my answer to
this equation is --

557
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:26,170
this u of t, this is my -- this
is my e to the A t u of zero.

558
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,907
So it's -- my job is
really now to say what's --

559
00:33:30,907 --> 00:33:31,740
what does that mean?

560
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,780
What's the exponential
of a matrix

561
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:38,390
and why is that formula correct?

562
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:38,950
Okay.

563
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,190
So I'll put that on
the board underneath.

564
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:45,210
What's the exponential
of a matrix?

565
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,430
Let me come back here.

566
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,460
So I'm talking about
matrix exponentials.

567
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,540
e to the At.

568
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,350
Okay.

569
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:01,090
How are we going to define
the exponential of a --

570
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:01,735
of something?

571
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:09,940
The trick -- the idea is --
the thing to go back to is

572
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:15,860
exponential -- there's a
power series for exponentials.

573
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,690
That's how you -- you -- the
good way to define e to the x

574
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:25,469
is the power series one plus
x plus one half x squared,

575
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:29,489
one six x cubed and we'll
do it now when the --

576
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,770
when we have a matrix.

577
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,739
So the one becomes the
identity, the x is At,

578
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:42,620
the x squared is At squared
and I divide by two.

579
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:47,600
The cube, the x cube
is At cubed over six,

580
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,880
and what's the
general term in here?

581
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,929
At to the n-th
power divided by --

582
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,710
and it goes on.

583
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:01,430
But what do I divide by?

584
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,350
So, you see the pattern
-- here I divided by one,

585
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:10,080
here I divided by one by two by
six, those are the factorials.

586
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,965
It's n factorial.

587
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,445
That was, like, the one
beautiful Taylor series.

588
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,180
The one beautiful Taylor series
-- well, there are two --

589
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,960
there are two beautiful
Taylor series in this world.

590
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,550
The Taylor series
for e to the x is

591
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:35,090
the s with x to the
n-th over n factorial.

592
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,680
And all I'm doing is doing
the same thing for matrixes.

593
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,850
The other beautiful
Taylor series

594
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:47,920
is just the sum of x to the
n-th not divided by n factorial.

595
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,300
Can you -- do you know
what function that one is?

596
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,990
So if I take --
this is the series,

597
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:58,070
all these sums are going
from zero to infinity.

598
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,960
What's -- what
function have I got --

599
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,770
this is like a side comment --

600
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:06,750
this is one plus x plus x
squared plus x cubed plus x

601
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,430
to the fourth not divided
by anything, what's --

602
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,800
what's that function?

603
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,380
One plus x plus x squared plus
x cubed plus x fourth forever

604
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,700
is one over one minus x.

605
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:24,120
It's the geometric series, the
nicest power series of all.

606
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,850
So, actually, of course, there
would be a similar thing here.

607
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:36,810
If -- if I wanted, I minus
A t inverse would be --

608
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,060
now I've got matrixes.

609
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,150
I've got matrixes everywhere,
but it's just like that series

610
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,690
with -- and just like this
one without the divisions.

611
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:56,310
It's I plus At plus At squared
plus At cubed and forever.

612
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,460
So that's actually a --
a reasonable way to find

613
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,660
the inverse of a matrix.

614
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,500
If I chop it off --

615
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,120
well, it's reasonable
if t is small.

616
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,330
If t is a small number, then --

617
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,940
then t squared is
extremely small,

618
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,350
t cubed is even smaller,
so approximately

619
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,480
that inverse is I plus At.

620
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,660
I can keep more terms if I like.

621
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,830
Do you see what I'm doing?

622
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:31,440
I'm just saying we can do the
same thing for matrixes that we

623
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,600
do for ordinary functions
and the good thing about

624
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,470
the exponential
series -- so in a way,

625
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,990
this series is
better than this one.

626
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,290
Why?

627
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,410
Because this one
always converges.

628
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,440
I'm dividing by these
bigger and bigger numbers,

629
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,770
so whatever matrix A and however
large t is, that series --

630
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,430
these terms go to zero.

631
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,960
The series adds up to a finite
sum, e to the At is a -- is --

632
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,390
is completely defined.

633
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:08,710
Whereas this second
guy could fail, right?

634
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:11,730
If At is big --

635
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:15,190
somehow if At has an
eigenvalue larger than one,

636
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,690
then when I square it it'll
have that eigenvalue squared,

637
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,820
when I cube it the
eigenvalue will be cubed --

638
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:26,560
that series will blow up
unless the eigenvalues of At

639
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,500
are smaller than one.

640
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,150
So when the eigenvalues of
At are smaller than one --

641
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,610
so I'd better put that in.

642
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:38,260
The -- all eigenvalues
of At below one --

643
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:42,230
then that series converges
and gives me the inverse.

644
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,970
Okay.

645
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:47,590
So this is the guy I'm chiefly
interested in, and I wanted

646
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:51,820
to connect it to --

647
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,400
oh, okay.

648
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,810
What's -- how do I -- how do
I get -- this is my, like,

649
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,160
main thing now to do --

650
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,270
how do I get e to the At --

651
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:05,760
how do I see that e to the
At is the same as this?

652
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:16,410
In other words, I can find e to
the At by finding S and lambda,

653
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,710
because now e to the lambda t

654
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,350
is easy.

655
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,820
Lambda's a diagonal matrix
and we can write down either

656
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,250
the lambda t -- and will
right -- in a minute.

657
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,810
But how -- do you see what --

658
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,290
do you see that
we're hoping for a --

659
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:38,540
we're hoping that we can
compute either the A T from S

660
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,450
and lambda --

661
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:44,980
and I have to look at that
definition and say, okay,

662
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,660
how do -- how do I get an S and
the lambda to come out of that?

663
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,670
Okay, can -- do you see how I --

664
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,830
I want to connect that to
that, from that definition.

665
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:59,090
So let me erase this --
the geometric series,

666
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:08,250
which isn't part of the
differential equations case

667
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:14,200
and get the S and the
lambda into this picture.

668
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,900
Oh, okay.

669
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,420
Here we go.

670
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:22,930
So identity is fine.

671
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:26,880
Now -- all right, you --
you -- you'll see how I'm --

672
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,900
how I'm -- how I going to
get A replaced by S and S is

673
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,550
in lambda's?

674
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,520
Well I use the fundamental
formula of this whole chapter.

675
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:43,540
A is S lambda S inverse
and then times t.

676
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,451
That's At.

677
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:45,950
Okay.

678
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,910
What's A squared t?

679
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,450
I can -- I've got
the divide by two,

680
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:56,580
I've got the t squared
and I've got an A squared.

681
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:02,580
All right, I -- so I've got
a -- there's A -- there's A.

682
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,390
Now square it.

683
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,880
So what happens
when I square it?

684
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,050
We've seen that before.

685
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:16,120
When I square it, I get S
lambda squared S inverse, right?

686
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,070
When I square that thing,
the -- there's an S and a --

687
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:23,840
an S cancels out an S inverse.

688
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,900
I'm left with the S
on the left, the S

689
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,140
inverse on the right and
lambda squared in the middle.

690
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,660
And so on.

691
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:36,680
The next one'll be S
lambda cubed, S inverse --

692
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,590
times t cubed over
three factorial.

693
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:45,190
And now -- what do I do now?

694
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,440
I want to pull an S
out from everything.

695
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,010
I want an S out of
the whole thing.

696
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,020
Well, look, I'd better
write the identity how?

697
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,250
I -- I want to be able to pull
an S out and an S inverse out

698
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,840
from the other side, so I just
write the identity as S times S

699
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,820
inverse.

700
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,120
So I have an S there and
an S inverse from this side

701
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,240
and what have I
got in the middle?

702
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,241
If I pull out an S
and an S inverse,

703
00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:19,490
what have I got in the middle?

704
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,260
I've got the
identity, a lambda t,

705
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,650
a lambda squared t
squared over two --

706
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:30,780
I've got e to the lambda t.

707
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,600
That's what's in the middle.

708
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,630
That's my formula
for e to the At.

709
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,120
Oh, now I have to ask you.

710
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,290
Does this formula always work?

711
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:45,420
This formula always works --

712
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,540
well, except it's
an infinite series.

713
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,800
But what do I mean
by always work?

714
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,300
And this one doesn't
always work and I just

715
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,460
have to remind you
of what assumption

716
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,660
is built into this
formula that's

717
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,580
not built into the original.

718
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,900
The assumption that A
can be diagonalized.

719
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,660
You'll remember that
there are some small --

720
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,770
sm- some subset of
matrixes that don't

721
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:18,000
have n independent
eigenvectors, so we

722
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,590
don't have an S inverse
for those matrixes

723
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:24,780
and the whole
diagonalization breaks down.

724
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,860
We could still
make it triangular.

725
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,010
I'll tell you about that.

726
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:32,930
But diagonal we can't do for
those particular degenerate

727
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:37,310
matrixes that don't have enough
independent eigenvectors.

728
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,240
But otherwise, this is golden.

729
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:40,970
Okay.

730
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:44,780
So that's the formula --
that's the matrix exponential.

731
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,680
Now it just remains for me to
say what is e to the lambda t?

732
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,460
Can I just do that?

733
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:55,280
Let me just put that
in the corner here.

734
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:02,180
What is the exponential
of a diagonal matrix?

735
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:10,140
Remember lambda is diagonal,
lambda one down to lambda n.

736
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,520
What's the exponential
of that diagonal matrix?

737
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,550
Because our whole point is
that this ought to be simple.

738
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:23,240
Our whole point is that to take
the exponential of a diagonal

739
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,560
matrix ought to be
completely decoupled --

740
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,300
it ought to be diagonal,
in other words, and it is.

741
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:37,010
It's just e to the lambda
one t, e to the lambda two t,

742
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:41,070
e to the lambda n t, all zeroes.

743
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:47,620
So -- so if we have a diagonal
matrix and I plug it into this

744
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:52,140
exponential formula,
everything's diagonal

745
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,710
and the diagonal terms are
just the ordinary scaler

746
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,930
exponentials e to
the lambda one t.

747
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,840
Okay, so that's -- that's --

748
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:06,050
in a sense, I'm doing here, on
this board, with -- with, like,

749
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:11,100
formulas what I did on the --

750
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,940
in the first half of the
lecture with specific matrix A

751
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:19,270
and specific eigenvalues
and eigenvectors.

752
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:21,990
The -- so let me show
you the formulas again.

753
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,770
But the -- so you --

754
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,300
I guess -- what should
you know from this

755
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,300
lecture?

756
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:34,180
You should know what this
matrix exponential is and, like,

757
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,670
when does it go to zero?

758
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,390
Tell me again, now,
the answer to that.

759
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,350
When does e to
the At approach --

760
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:45,510
get smaller and
smaller as t increases?

761
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,070
Well, the S and the S
inverse aren't moving.

762
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:51,780
It's this one that has to
get smaller and smaller

763
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:57,160
and that one has this
simple diagonal form.

764
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,740
And it goes to zero provided
every one of these lambdas --

765
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,840
I -- I need to have each one
of these guys go to zero,

766
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,930
so I need every real part of
every eigenvalue negative.

767
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:13,230
Right?

768
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,690
If the real part is
negative, that's --

769
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,160
that takes the exponential
-- that forces --

770
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,420
the exponential goes to zero.

771
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,480
Okay, so that -- that's
really the difference.

772
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:33,250
If I can just draw the -- here's
a picture of the -- of the --

773
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:36,780
this is the complex plain.

774
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:42,080
Here's the real axis and
here's the imaginary axis.

775
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,960
And where do the
eigenvalues have

776
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,570
to be for stability in
differential equations?

777
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:52,470
They have to be over here,
in the left half plain.

778
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:55,910
So the left half plain is this
plain, real part of lambda,

779
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:58,820
less than zero.

780
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,190
Where do the ma- where
do the eigenvalues have

781
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:06,500
to be for powers of the
matrix to go to zero?

782
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,960
Powers of the matrix go to zero
if the eigenvalues are in here.

783
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:17,800
So this is the stability
region for powers --

784
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,490
this is the region -- absolute
value of lambda, less than one.

785
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:26,740
That's the stability for -- that
tells us that the powers of A

786
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,260
go to zero, this tells us
that the exponential of A goes

787
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,220
to zero.

788
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:31,790
Okay.

789
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,700
One final example.

790
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:38,580
Let me just write down how
to deal with a final example.

791
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,980
Let's see.

792
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,930
So my final example will be a
single equation, u''+bu'+Ku=0.

793
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,000
One equation, second order.

794
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,490
How do I --

795
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:05,290
and maybe I should have used --

796
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,170
I'll use -- I prefer
to use y here,

797
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:12,170
because that's what you see
in differential equations.

798
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,790
And I want u to be a vector.

799
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:23,730
So how do I change one second
order equation into a two

800
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:28,250
by two first order system?

801
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,540
Just the way I
did for Fibonacci.

802
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:38,180
I'll let u be y prime and y.

803
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:43,210
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to add an extra equation,

804
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,620
y prime equals y prime.

805
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,800
So I take this -- so by --

806
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,110
so using this as
the vector unknown,

807
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:58,830
now my equation is u prime.

808
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,800
My first order
system is u prime,

809
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,160
that'll be y double prime y
prime, the derivative of u,

810
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,940
okay, now the differential
equation is telling me that y

811
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,430
double prime is m- so
I'm just looking for --

812
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:17,160
what's this matrix?

813
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,410
y prime y.

814
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:23,220
I'm looking for the matrix A.

815
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:28,460
What's the matrix in case I have
a single first order equation

816
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:31,140
and I want to make it
into a two by two system?

817
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,270
Okay, simple.

818
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:35,920
The first row of the matrix
is given by the equation.

819
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:43,800
So y''-by'-ky -- no problem.

820
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,240
And what's the second
row on the matrix?

821
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,660
Then we're done.

822
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,710
The second row of the
matrix I want just

823
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:54,490
to be the trivial equation
y prime equals y prime,

824
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,340
so I need a one
and a zero there.

825
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,950
So matrixes like these,
the gen- the general case,

826
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:09,050
if I had a five by five -- if
I had a fifth order equation

827
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,590
and I wanted a five
by five matrix,

828
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:15,850
I would see the coefficients of
the equation up there and then

829
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:21,260
my four trivial equations
would put ones here.

830
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:27,110
This is the kind of matrix
that goes from a fifth order

831
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:32,060
to a five by five first order.

832
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:40,010
So the -- and the eigenvalues
will come out in a natural way

833
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,350
connected to the differential

834
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:41,970
equation.

835
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:45,840
Okay, that's
differential equations.

836
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,890
The -- a parallel lecture
compared to powers of a matrix

837
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:52,060
we can now do exponentials.

838
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,610
Thanks.
