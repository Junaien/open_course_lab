1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,860
Okay.

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:21,760
This is the lecture on the
singular value decomposition.

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,030
But everybody calls it the SVD.

4
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:34,350
So this is the final and best
factorization of a matrix.

5
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,270
Let me tell you what's coming.

6
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:43,330
The factors will be, orthogonal
matrix, diagonal matrix,

7
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,610
orthogonal matrix.

8
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,610
So it's things that
we've seen before,

9
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,180
these special good matrices,
orthogonal diagonal.

10
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,810
The new point is that we
need two orthogonal matrices.

11
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,720
A can be any matrix whatsoever.

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,140
Any matrix whatsoever has this
singular value decomposition,

13
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,870
so a diagonal one in the middle,
but I need two different --

14
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:17,030
probably different orthogonal
matrices to be able to do this.

15
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,560
Okay.

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,030
And this factorization
has jumped into importance

17
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:27,240
and is properly, I think,
maybe the bringing together

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,620
of everything in this course.

19
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:36,970
One thing we'll bring together
is the very good family

20
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,070
of matrices that
we just studied,

21
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,120
symmetric, positive, definite.

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,730
Do you remember the
stories with those guys?

23
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:49,160
Because they were symmetric,
their eigenvectors were

24
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,880
orthogonal, so I could produce
an orthogonal matrix --

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,070
this is my usual one.

26
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,630
My usual one is the
eigenvectors and eigenvalues In

27
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:05,540
the symmetric case, the
eigenvectors are orthogonal,

28
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,430
so I've got the good --
my ordinary s has become

29
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,180
an especially good Q.

30
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,610
And positive definite,
my ordinary lambda

31
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,260
has become a positive lambda.

32
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:24,420
So that's the singular
value decomposition in case

33
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,240
our matrix is symmetric
positive definite --

34
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,650
in that case, I
don't need two --

35
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,795
U and a V -- one orthogonal
matrix will do for both sides.

36
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,260
So this would be
no good in general,

37
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,190
because usually the eigenvector
matrix isn't orthogonal.

38
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,900
So that's not what I'm after.

39
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,790
I'm looking for orthogonal
times diagonal times orthogonal.

40
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,250
And let me show you what that
means and where it comes from.

41
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,880
Okay.

42
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,680
What does it mean?

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,310
You remember the picture of
any linear transformation.

44
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:16,670
This was, like, the
most important figure in

45
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,810
And what I looking for now?

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:26,020
A typical vector
in the row space --

47
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,940
typical vector,
let me call it v1,

48
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:35,470
gets taken over to some vector
in the column space, say u1.

49
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,850
So u1 is Av1.

50
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,320
Okay.

51
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,800
Now, another vector gets
taken over here somewhere.

52
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,290
What I looking for?

53
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,590
In this SVD, this singular
value decomposition,

54
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,950
what I'm looking for is
an orthogonal basis here

55
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:06,130
that gets knocked over into an
orthogonal basis over there.

56
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:11,810
See that's pretty special,
to have an orthogonal basis

57
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:18,180
in the row space that goes over
into an orthogonal basis --

58
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,490
so this is like a right angle
and this is a right angle --

59
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,700
into an orthogonal basis
in the column space.

60
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,940
So that's our
goal, is to find --

61
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,230
do you see how things
are coming together?

62
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,590
First of all, can I
find an orthogonal basis

63
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,960
for this row space?

64
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,100
Of course.

65
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,210
No big deal to find
an orthogonal basis.

66
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,870
Graham Schmidt tells
me how to do it.

67
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,710
Start with any old basis and
grind through Graham Schmidt,

68
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,100
out comes an orthogonal basis.

69
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,280
But then, if I just take any
old orthogonal basis, then

70
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,990
when I multiply by
A, there's no reason

71
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,770
why it should be
orthogonal over here.

72
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,800
So I'm looking for
this special set

73
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,850
up where A takes these basis
vectors into orthogonal vectors

74
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,780
over there.

75
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,570
Now, you might have
noticed that the null space

76
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,400
I didn't include.

77
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Why don't I stick that in?

78
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,770
You remember our usual figure
had a little null space

79
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,730
and a little null space.

80
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,650
And those are no problems.

81
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,000
Those null spaces
are going to show up

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,510
as zeroes on the
diagonal of sigma,

83
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:43,730
so that doesn't
present any difficulty.

84
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,250
Our difficulty is to find these.

85
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,220
So do you see what
this will mean?

86
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:57,950
This will mean that A times
these v-s, v1, v2, up to --

87
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,460
what's the dimension
of this row space?

88
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,180
Vr.

89
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,390
Sorry, make that V a
little smaller -- up to vr.

90
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,990
So that's --

91
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,680
Av1 is going to be
the first column,

92
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,250
so here's what I'm achieving.

93
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,390
Oh, I'm not only going
to make these orthogonal,

94
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,030
but why not make
them orthonormal?

95
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,880
Make them unit vectors.

96
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,380
So maybe the unit vector
is here, is the u1,

97
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,510
and this might be
a multiple of it.

98
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:45,560
So really, what's happening
is Av1 is some multiple of u1,

99
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,660
right?

100
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,040
These guys will be unit
vectors and they'll

101
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,940
go over into multiples
of unit vectors

102
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,820
and the multiple I'm not
going to call lambda anymore.

103
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,090
I'm calling it sigma.

104
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,480
So that's the number --
the stretching number.

105
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,000
And similarly, Av2
is sigma two u2.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This is my goal.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,730
And now I want to express
that goal in matrix language.

108
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,340
That's the usual step.

109
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,400
Think of what you want
and then express it

110
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,420
as a matrix multiplication.

111
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,800
So Av1 is sigma one u1 --

112
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,960
actually, here we go.

113
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,710
Let me pull out these --

114
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,765
u1, u2 to ur and then a
matrix with the sigmas.

115
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,970
Everything now is going
to be in that little part

116
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,720
of the blackboard.

117
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,880
Do you see that this
equation says what I'm

118
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,740
trying to do with my figure.

119
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,770
A times the first basis vector
should be sigma one times

120
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,580
the other basis -- the
other first basis vector.

121
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,150
These are the basis
vectors in the row space,

122
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,470
these are the basis
vectors in the column space

123
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,680
and these are the
multiplying factors.

124
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:23,660
So Av2 is sigma two times
u2, Avr is sigma r times ur.

125
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,170
And then we've got a whole lot
of zeroes and maybe some zeroes

126
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,480
at the end, but that's
the heart of it.

127
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,064
And now if I express that in --

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,350
as matrices, because you
knew that was coming --

129
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,140
that's what I have.

130
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:51,520
So, this is my goal, to
find an orthogonal basis

131
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,500
in the orthonormal, even
-- basis in the row space

132
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,420
and an orthonormal basis in the
column space so that I've sort

133
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,590
of diagonalized the matrix.

134
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,530
The matrix A is, like,
getting converted

135
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,660
to this diagonal matrix sigma.

136
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,140
And you notice that usually
I have to allow myself

137
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,980
two different bases.

138
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,230
My little comment about
symmetric positive definite

139
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:24,860
was the one case where
it's A Q equal Q sigma,

140
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,430
where V and U are the same Q.

141
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:32,310
But mostly, you know, I'm going
to take a matrix like -- oh,

142
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:38,240
let me take a matrix like
four four minus three three.

143
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,540
Okay.

144
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,420
There's a two by two matrix.

145
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,430
It's invertible,
so it has rank two.

146
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,210
So I'm going to look
for two vectors,

147
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,230
v1 and v2 in the
row space, and U --

148
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,770
so I'm going to look for
v1, v2 in the row space,

149
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,350
which of course is R^2.

150
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,280
And I'm going to look for
u1, u2 in the column space,

151
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,620
which of course is also R^2, and
I'm going to look for numbers

152
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:21,160
sigma one and sigma two so
that it all comes out right.

153
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,060
So these guys are orthonormal,
these guys are orthonormal

154
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,820
and these are the
scaling factors.

155
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,510
So I'll do that example as
soon as I get the matrix

156
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,030
picture straight.

157
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,280
Okay.

158
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,380
Do you see that this
expresses what I want?

159
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,360
Can I just say two
words about null spaces?

160
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,010
If there's some
null space, then we

161
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:56,080
want to stick in a basis
for those, for that.

162
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,700
So here comes a basis for the
null space, v(r+1) down to vm.

163
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,590
So if we only had an r
dimensional row space

164
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,160
and the other n-r dimensions
were in the null space -- okay,

165
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,360
we'll take an orthogonal
-- orthonormal basis there.

166
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,430
No problem.

167
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,500
And then we'll just get zeroes.

168
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,700
So, actually, w- those
zeroes will come out

169
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,040
on the diagonal matrix.

170
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:33,250
So I'll complete that to an
orthonormal basis for the whole

171
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,420
space, R^m.

172
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,080
I complete this to an
orthonormal basis for the whole

173
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,420
space R^n and I complete
that with zeroes.

174
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,870
Null spaces are no problem here.

175
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,570
So really the true problem
is in a matrix like that,

176
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,170
which isn't symmetric, so I
can't use its eigenvectors,

177
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,110
they're not orthogonal --

178
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,740
but somehow I have to get
these orthogonal -- in fact,

179
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:09,470
orthonormal guys
that make it work.

180
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,990
I have to find these orthonormal
guys, these orthonormal guys

181
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:22,960
and I want Av1 to be sigma one
u1 and Av2 to be sigma two u2.

182
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,460
Okay.

183
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,260
That's my goal.

184
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:34,310
Here's the matrices that
are going to get me there.

185
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,500
Now these are
orthogonal matrices.

186
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,610
I can put that -- if I multiply
on both sides by V inverse,

187
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:47,740
I have A equals U
sigma V inverse,

188
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:53,230
and of course you know the
other way I can write V inverse.

189
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,200
This is one of those
square orthogonal matrices,

190
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,731
so it's the same as
U sigma V transpose.

191
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:03,230
Okay.

192
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,900
Here's my problem.

193
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:14,580
I've got two orthogonal
matrices here.

194
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,330
And I don't want to
find them both at once.

195
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,120
So I want to cook up
some expression that

196
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,630
will make the Us disappear.

197
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,010
I would like to make the
Us disappear and leave me

198
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,070
only with the Vs.

199
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,200
And here's how to do it.

200
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,520
It's the same combination
that keeps showing up

201
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,040
whenever we have a general
rectangular matrix,

202
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,640
then it's A transpose A,
that's the great matrix.

203
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,760
That's the great matrix.

204
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,530
That's the matrix
that's symmetric,

205
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,910
and in fact positive
definite or at least

206
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,240
positive semi-definite.

207
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,300
This is the matrix with nice
properties, so let's see what

208
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,230
will it be?

209
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,100
So if I took the transpose,
then, I would have --

210
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,140
A transpose A will be what?

211
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,920
What do I have?

212
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,580
If I transpose that I have V
sigma transpose U transpose,

213
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,900
that's the A transpose.

214
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,350
Now the A --

215
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,290
and what have I got?

216
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,960
Looks like worse, because it's
got six things now together,

217
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,660
but it's going to collapse
into something good.

218
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,300
What does U transpose
U collapse into?

219
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,770
I, the identity.

220
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,330
So that's the key point.

221
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,050
This is the identity and
we don't have U anymore.

222
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,380
And sigma transpose
times sigma, those

223
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,300
are diagonal matrixes,
so their product is just

224
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,590
going to have sigma
squareds on the diagonal.

225
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,650
So do you see what
we've got here?

226
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:57,440
This is V times this
easy matrix sigma

227
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,080
one squared sigma two
squared times V transpose.

228
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,840
This is the A transpose A.

229
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,590
This is -- let me copy down --

230
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,185
A transpose A is that.

231
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,170
Us are out of the picture, now.

232
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,900
I'm only having to choose the
Vs, and what are these Vs?

233
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,370
And what are these sigmas?

234
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:26,750
Do you know what the Vs are?

235
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,650
They're the eigenvectors
that -- see,

236
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:34,120
this is a perfect
eigenvector, eigenvalue,

237
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:41,920
Q lambda Q transpose for
the matrix A transpose A.

238
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,020
A itself is nothing special.

239
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,620
But A transpose A
will be special.

240
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,700
It'll be symmetric
positive definite,

241
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,340
so this will be its eigenvectors
and this'll be its eigenvalues.

242
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,100
And the eigenvalues'll be
positive because this thing's

243
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,400
positive definite.

244
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,650
So this is my method.

245
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,310
This tells me what the Vs are.

246
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,210
And how I going to find the Us?

247
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:18,570
Well, one way would be
to look at A A transpose.

248
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,650
Multiply A by A transpose
in the opposite order.

249
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,340
That will stick the
Vs in the middle,

250
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,130
knock them out, and
leave me with the Us.

251
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,620
So here's the overall
picture, then.

252
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:36,270
The Vs are the eigenvectors
of A transpose A.

253
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,180
The Us are the
eigenvectors of A A

254
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,860
transpose, which are different.

255
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,940
And the sigmas are
the square roots

256
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,730
of these and the
positive square roots,

257
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,580
so we have positive sigmas.

258
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,780
Let me do it for that example.

259
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,570
This is really what
you should know

260
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:01,460
and be able to do for the SVD.

261
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,520
Okay.

262
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,740
Let me take that matrix.

263
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,550
So what's my first step?

264
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:12,191
Compute A transpose A, because
I want its eigenvectors.

265
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,690
Okay.

266
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,690
So I have to compute
A transpose A.

267
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:22,240
So A transpose is four
four minus three three,

268
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,970
and A is four four
minus three three,

269
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,810
and I do that multiplication
and I get sixteen --

270
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,930
I get twenty five --

271
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,300
I get sixteen minus nine --

272
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,870
is that seven?

273
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,260
And it better come
out symmetric.

274
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,190
And -- oh, okay, and
then it comes out 25.

275
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,690
Okay.

276
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,030
So, I want its eigenvectors
and its eigenvalues.

277
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,680
Its eigenvectors will be
the Vs, its eigenvalues

278
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,990
will be the squares
of the sigmas.

279
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,570
Okay.

280
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:04,900
What are the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of this guy?

281
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,690
Have you seen that two by two
example enough to recognize

282
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:16,970
that the eigenvectors are --
that one one is an eigenvector?

283
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,210
So this here is A transpose A.

284
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,300
I'm looking for
its eigenvectors.

285
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:27,620
So its eigenvectors, I think,
are one one and one minus one,

286
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,800
because if I
multiply that matrix

287
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,390
by one one, what do I get?

288
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,720
If I multiply that matrix
by one one, I get 32 32,

289
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,530
which is 32 of one one.

290
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,240
So there's the
first eigenvector,

291
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,360
and there's the eigenvalue
for A transpose A.

292
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:59,120
So I'm going to take its
square root for sigma.

293
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,620
Okay.

294
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,310
What's the eigenvector
that goes --

295
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,410
eigenvalue that
goes with this one?

296
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,730
If I do that multiplication,
what do I get?

297
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:12,420
I get some multiple of one minus
one, and what is that multiple?

298
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,250
Looks like 18.

299
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,340
Okay.

300
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,880
So those are the two
eigenvectors, but -- oh,

301
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,300
just a moment, I
didn't normalize them.

302
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,310
To make everything
absolutely right,

303
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,180
I ought to normalize
these eigenvectors,

304
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,370
divide by their length,
square root of two.

305
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:42,890
So all these guys should be true
unit vectors and, of course,

306
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,900
that normalization didn't
change the 32 and the 18.

307
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,500
Okay.

308
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,980
So I'm happy with the Vs.

309
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,380
Here are the Vs.

310
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,490
So now let me put
together the pieces here.

311
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,340
Here's my A.

312
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,060
Here's my A.

313
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,550
Let me write down A again.

314
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:16,150
If life is right, we should get
U, which I don't yet know --

315
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,870
U I don't yet know,
sigma I do now know.

316
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,040
What's sigma?

317
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,080
So I'm looking for a
U sigma V transpose.

318
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,115
U, the diagonal guy
and V transpose.

319
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,030
Okay.

320
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,740
Let's just see that
come out right.

321
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,780
So what are the sigmas?

322
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,130
They're the square
roots of these things.

323
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,820
So square root of 32
and square root of 18.

324
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,120
Zero zero.

325
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,210
Okay.

326
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,040
What are the Vs?

327
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,810
They're these two.

328
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,900
And I have to transpose --

329
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,450
maybe that just
leaves me with ones --

330
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,790
with one over square root of two
in that row and the other one

331
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,870
is one over square
root of two minus one

332
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,010
over square root of two.

333
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,030
Now finally, I've
got to know the Us.

334
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,570
Well, actually, one way to do --
since I now know all the other

335
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,100
pieces, I could put those
together and figure out what

336
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,110
the Us are.

337
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,780
But let me do it the
A A transpose way.

338
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,280
Okay.

339
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,380
Find the Us now.

340
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,070
u1 and u2.

341
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,650
And what are they?

342
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,240
I look at A A transpose --

343
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:47,230
so A is supposed to be U
sigma V transpose, and then

344
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:52,652
when I transpose that I get V
sigma transpose U transpose.

345
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,160
So I'm just doing it
in the opposite order,

346
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,470
A times A transpose, and
what's the good part here?

347
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:10,480
That in the middle, V transpose
V is going to be the identity.

348
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,990
So this is just U
sigma sigma transpose,

349
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:22,340
that's some diagonal matrix with
sigma squareds and U transpose.

350
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,480
So what I seeing here?

351
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,280
I'm seeing here, again, a
symmetric positive definite

352
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,000
or at least semi-definite
matrix and I'm

353
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,600
seeing its eigenvectors
and its eigenvalues.

354
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,590
So if I compute A A
transpose, its eigenvectors

355
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,060
will be the things
that go into U.

356
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,470
Okay, so I need to
compute A A transpose.

357
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,970
I guess I'm going
to have to go --

358
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,450
can I move that
up just a little?

359
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,580
Maybe a little more
and do A A transpose.

360
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,820
So what's A?

361
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,930
Four four minus three and three.

362
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,550
And what's A transpose?

363
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,310
Four four minus three and three.

364
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:15,530
And when I do that
multiplication, what do I get?

365
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,750
Sixteen and sixteen, thirty two.

366
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,630
Uh, that one comes out zero.

367
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,940
Oh, so this is a lucky case
and that one comes out 18.

368
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,560
So this is an accident
that A A transpose

369
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:38,030
happens to come out diagonal, so
we know easily its eigenvectors

370
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,990
and eigenvalues.

371
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:43,130
So its eigenvectors -- what's
the first eigenvector for this

372
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,150
A A transpose matrix?

373
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,940
It's just one zero, and when
I do that multiplication,

374
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,020
I get 32 times one zero.

375
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,380
And the other eigenvector
is just zero one

376
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,350
and when I multiply
by that I get 18.

377
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,720
So this is A A transpose.

378
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,910
Multiplying that gives
me the 32 A A transpose.

379
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:14,860
Multiplying this guy
gives me First of all,

380
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,590
I got 32 and 18 again.

381
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,740
Am I surprised?

382
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,420
You know, it's clearly
not an accident.

383
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,190
The eigenvalues of A A
transpose were exactly the same

384
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:37,820
as the eigenvalues of --
this one was A transpose A.

385
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,140
That's no surprise at all.

386
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:47,140
The eigenvalues of A B are the
same as the eigenvalues of B A.

387
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,530
That's a very nice
fact, that eigenvalues

388
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,310
stay the same if I switch
the order of multiplication.

389
00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:01,650
So no surprise to see
32 and What I learned --

390
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,550
first the check that things
were numerically correct,

391
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,950
but now I've learned
these eigenvectors,

392
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,980
and actually they're
about as nice as can be.

393
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,045
They're the best orthogonal
matrix, just the identity.

394
00:25:18,511 --> 00:25:19,010
Okay.

395
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,400
So my claim is that it
ought to all fit together,

396
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,560
that these numbers
should come out right.

397
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,440
The numbers should
come out right

398
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:41,070
because the matrix
multiplications use

399
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,450
the properties that we want.

400
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:42,970
Okay.

401
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,370
Shall we just check that?

402
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,020
Here's the identity, so
not doing anything --

403
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,530
square root of 32 is
multiplying that row,

404
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,670
so that square root of 32
divided by square root of two

405
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,150
means square root of
16, four, correct?

406
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,680
And square root of 18 is
divided by square root of two,

407
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,570
so that leaves me square root
of 9, which is three, but --

408
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,100
well, Professor Strang,
you see the problem?

409
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,740
Why is that --

410
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,240
okay.

411
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,790
Why I getting minus
three three here

412
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,965
and here I'm getting
three minus three?

413
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,240
Phooey.

414
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,105
I don't know why.

415
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,650
It shouldn't have
happened, but it did.

416
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,402
Now, okay, you could
say, well, just --

417
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,560
the eigenvector
there could have --

418
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,410
I could have had the minus
sign here for that eigenvector,

419
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,710
but I'm not happy about that.

420
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,210
Hmm.

421
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:50,710
Okay.

422
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,480
So I realize there's a
little catch here somewhere

423
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,630
and I may not see
it until Wednesday.

424
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,830
Which then gives you a
very important reason

425
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,930
to come back on Wednesday, to
catch that sine difference.

426
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:14,310
So what did I do illegally?

427
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:22,550
I think I put the eigenvectors
in that matrix V transpose --

428
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,160
okay, I'm going
to have to think.

429
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,460
Why did that come out with
with the opposite sines?

430
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,510
So you see --

431
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,000
I mean, if I had a minus
there, I would be all right,

432
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,490
but I don't want that.

433
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:45,331
I want positive entries down
the diagonal of sigma squared.

434
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:45,830
Okay.

435
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:51,590
It'll come to me, but, I'm
going to leave this example

436
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:57,600
to finish.

437
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,920
Okay.

438
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,560
And the beauty of,
these sliding boards

439
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,780
is I can make that go away.

440
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,910
Can I,-- let me not
do it, though, yet.

441
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:15,090
Let me take a second example.

442
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,720
Let me take a second example
where the matrix is singular.

443
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,090
So rank one.

444
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:32,390
Okay, so let me take
as an example two,

445
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:38,770
where my matrix A is going
to be rectangular again --

446
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,220
let me just make it
four three eight six.

447
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,090
Okay.

448
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,830
That's a rank one matrix.

449
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:57,430
So that has a null space and
only a one dimensional row

450
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,370
space and column space.

451
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:05,510
So actually, my picture
becomes easy for this matrix,

452
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,510
because what's my row
space for this one?

453
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,450
So this is two by two.

454
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:17,000
So my pictures are
both two dimensional.

455
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,390
My row space is all multiples
of that vector four three.

456
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,760
So the whole -- the row
space is just a line, right?

457
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,380
That's the row space.

458
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,050
And the null space, of course,
is the perpendicular line.

459
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:46,480
So the row space for this matrix
is multiples of four three.

460
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,680
Typical row.

461
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,520
Okay.

462
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,060
What's the column space?

463
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:55,980
The columns are all multiples of
four eight, three six, one two.

464
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,315
The column space, then, goes
in, like, this direction.

465
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,490
So the column space --

466
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,650
when I look at those
columns, the column space --

467
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,660
so it's only one dimensional,
because the rank is one.

468
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:21,480
It's multiples of four eight.

469
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,370
Okay.

470
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:26,360
And what's the null
space of A transpose?

471
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,270
It's the perpendicular guy.

472
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:35,150
So this was the null
space of A and this is

473
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:38,921
the null space of A transpose.

474
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:39,420
Okay.

475
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:48,650
What I want to say here is that
choosing these orthogonal bases

476
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:53,750
for the row space and the column
space is, like, no problem.

477
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,800
They're only one dimensional.

478
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,020
So what should V be?

479
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,620
V should be -- v1, but
-- yes, v1, rather --

480
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,540
v1 is supposed to
be a unit vector.

481
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,640
There's only one
v1 to choose here,

482
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,210
only one dimension
in the row space.

483
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,800
I just want to make
it a unit vector.

484
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,180
So v1 will be --

485
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:24,570
it'll be this vector, but made
into a unit vector, so four --

486
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,970
point eight point six.

487
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,670
Four fifths, three fifths.

488
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,040
And what will be u1?

489
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,740
u1 will be the
unit vector there.

490
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:40,820
So I want to turn four eight
or one two into a unit vector,

491
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,150
so u1 will be --

492
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,760
let's see, if it's one two,
then what multiple of one two

493
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,230
do I want?

494
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,240
That has length
square root of five,

495
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,460
so I have to divide by
square root of five.

496
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,470
Let me complete
the singular value

497
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:01,660
decomposition for this matrix.

498
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:09,540
So this matrix, four
three eight six, is --

499
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,520
so I know what u1 --

500
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:19,570
here's A and I want to get U
the basis in the column space.

501
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,020
And it has to start
with this guy, one

502
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,290
over square root of five two
over square root of five.

503
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:36,350
Then I want the sigma.

504
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,540
Okay.

505
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,370
What are we expecting
now for sigma?

506
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,010
This is only a rank one matrix.

507
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:51,720
We're only expecting a sigma
one, which I have to find,

508
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,040
but zeroes here.

509
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,540
Okay.

510
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,420
So what's sigma one?

511
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:02,950
It should be the --

512
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,480
where did these
sigmas come from?

513
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,370
They came from A
transpose A, so I --

514
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,750
can I do that little
calculation over here?

515
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:19,840
A transpose A is four three --
four three eight six times four

516
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,340
three eight six.

517
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,240
This had better -- this
is a rank one matrix,

518
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,170
this is going to be -- the
whole thing will have rank one,

519
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:40,240
that's 16 and 64 is 80, 12
and 48 is 60, 12 and 48 is 60,

520
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,880
9 and 36 is 45.

521
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,520
Okay.

522
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,340
It's a rank one matrix.

523
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,230
Of course.

524
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,450
Every row is a
multiple of four three.

525
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:56,820
And what's the eigen -- what are
the eigenvalues of that matrix?

526
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,730
So this is the calculation
-- this is like practicing,

527
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,230
now.

528
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,510
What are the eigenvalues
of this rank one matrix?

529
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,389
Well, tell me one eigenvalue,
since the rank is only one,

530
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:11,920
one eigenvalue is
going to be zero.

531
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,320
And then you know that
the other eigenvalue

532
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,330
is going to be a
hundred and twenty five.

533
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,760
So that's sigma squared,
right, in A transpose A.

534
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,780
So this will be the square root
of a hundred and twenty five.

535
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,900
And then finally,
the V transpose --

536
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,750
the Vs will be --

537
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,830
there's v1, and what's v2?

538
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,170
What's v2 in the --

539
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:50,739
how do I make this into
an orthonormal basis?

540
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:55,480
Well, v2 is, in the
null space direction.

541
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,810
It's perpendicular to that,
so point six and minus point

542
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,790
eight.

543
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,400
So those are the
Vs that go in here.

544
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:11,920
Point eight, point six and
point six minus point eight.

545
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,420
Okay.

546
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,410
And I guess I better
finish this guy.

547
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:21,580
So this guy, all I want is to
complete the orthonormal basis

548
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,670
-- it'll be coming from there.

549
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:28,770
It'll be a two over square
root of five and a minus one

550
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,330
over square root of five.

551
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:35,100
Let me take square root
of five out of that matrix

552
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,080
to make it look better.

553
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:44,850
So one over square root of five
times one two two minus one.

554
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,920
Okay.

555
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,160
So there I have -- including
the square root of five --

556
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,870
that's an orthogonal matrix,
that's an orthogonal matrix,

557
00:35:56,870 --> 00:36:01,190
that's a diagonal matrix
and its rank is only one.

558
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,800
And now if I do
that multiplication,

559
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,550
I pray that it comes out right.

560
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,022
The square root of
five will cancel

561
00:36:12,022 --> 00:36:13,480
into that square
root of one twenty

562
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,390
five and leave me with the
square root of 25, which

563
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:20,190
is five, and five will
multiply these numbers

564
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:24,410
and I'll get whole numbers
and out will come A.

565
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,230
Okay.

566
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:31,110
That's like a second example
showing how the null space guy

567
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:39,680
-- so this -- this vector
and this one were multiplied

568
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,620
by this zero.

569
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:46,370
So they were easy to deal with.

570
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,960
Tthe key ones are the ones in
the column space and the row

571
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,480
space.

572
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,920
Do you see how I'm getting
columns here, diagonal here,

573
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,330
rows here, coming
together to produce A.

574
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:06,790
Okay, that's the singular
value decomposition.

575
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:13,370
So, let me think what I want
to add to complete this topic.

576
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,970
So that's two examples.

577
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,740
And now let's think
what we're really doing.

578
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:33,770
We're choosing the right
basis for the four subspaces

579
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,010
of linear algebra.

580
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:39,640
Let me write this down.

581
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:52,785
So v1 up to vr is an orthonormal
basis for the row space.

582
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:05,570
u1 up to ur is an orthonormal
basis for the column space.

583
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:14,930
And then I just finish
those out by v(r+1),

584
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:20,350
the rest up to vn is an
orthonormal basis for the null

585
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:20,850
space.

586
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:35,220
And finally, u(r+1) up to is an
orthonormal basis for the null

587
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,320
space of A transpose.

588
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:45,360
Do you see that we finally
got the bases right?

589
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:51,170
They're right because they're
orthonormal, and also --

590
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:55,100
again, Graham Schmidt would
have done this in chapter four.

591
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:00,920
Here we needed eigenvalues,
because these bases

592
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,070
make the matrix diagonal.

593
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:09,400
A times V I is a
multiple of U I.

594
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,250
So I'll put "and" --

595
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,640
the matrix has
been made diagonal.

596
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:24,730
When we choose these bases,
there's no coupling between Vs

597
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,740
and no coupling between Us.

598
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,550
Each A -- A times each
V is in the direction

599
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,980
of the corresponding U.

600
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,700
So it's exactly the
right basis for the four

601
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,130
fundamental subspaces.

602
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,570
And of course, their
dimensions are what we know.

603
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,850
The dimension of
the row space is

604
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:49,450
the rank r, and so is the
dimension of the column space.

605
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,190
The dimension of
the null space is

606
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,620
n-r, that's how many
vectors we need,

607
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:59,790
and m-r basis vectors for the
left null space, the null space

608
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,960
of A transpose.

609
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,620
Okay.

610
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,850
I'm going to stop there.

611
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:10,720
I could develop
further from the SVD,

612
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,140
but we'll see it again
in the very last lectures

613
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,949
of the course.

614
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:15,740
So there's the SVD.

615
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,290
Thanks.
