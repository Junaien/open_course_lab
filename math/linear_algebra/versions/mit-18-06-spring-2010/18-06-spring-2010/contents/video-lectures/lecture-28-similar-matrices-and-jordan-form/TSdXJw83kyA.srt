1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,650
Okay.

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:15,450
This lecture is mostly about
the idea of similar matrixes.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,520
I'm going to tell you what
that word similar means

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,990
and in what way two
matrixes are called similar.

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,870
But before I do that,
I have a little more

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,310
to say about positive
definite matrixes.

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:34,880
You can tell this is a subject I
think is really important and I

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,170
told you what positive
definite meant --

9
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,430
it means that this --

10
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,490
this expression, this
quadratic form, x transpose I

11
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,010
x is always positive.

12
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,710
But the direct way to test
it was with eigenvalues

13
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,940
or pivots or determinants.

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,730
So I -- we know what it
means, we know how to test it,

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,820
but I didn't really say where
positive definite matrixes come

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,140
from.

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,470
And so one thing I want to say
is that they come from least

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,780
squares in -- and all sorts of
physical problems start with

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,520
a rectangular matrix -- well,
you remember in least squares

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,810
the crucial combination
was A transpose A.

21
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,970
So I want to show that that's
a positive definite matrix.

22
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:28,727
Can -- so I --

23
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:31,060
I'm going to speak a little
more about positive definite

24
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,730
matrixes, just recapping --

25
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,400
so let me ask a question.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,910
It may be on the homework.

27
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,330
Suppose a matrix A
is positive definite.

28
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,360
I mean by that it's all --

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,100
I'm assuming it's symmetric.

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,760
That's always built
into the definition.

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,440
So we have a symmetric
positive definite matrix.

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,610
What about its inverse?

33
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,180
Is the inverse of a symmetric
positive definite matrix also

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,310
symmetric positive definite?

35
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,789
So you quickly think,
okay, what do I

36
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:15,240
know about the pivots
of the inverse matrix?

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,390
Not much.

38
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,620
What do I know about
the eigenvalues

39
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,540
of the inverse matrix?

40
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,480
Everything, right?

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,310
The eigenvalues
of the inverse are

42
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,290
one over the eigenvalues
of the matrix.

43
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,680
So if my matrix starts
out positive definite,

44
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,490
then right away I know that its
inverse is positive definite,

45
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,440
because those positive
eigenvalues --

46
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,560
then one over the
eigenvalue is also positive.

47
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,820
What if I know that A -- a
matrix A and a matrix B are

48
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,280
both positive definite?

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,780
But let me ask you this.

50
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:04,140
Suppose if A and B are positive
definite, what about --

51
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,940
what about A plus B?

52
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,600
In some way, you hope
that that would be true.

53
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,730
It's -- positive definite for a
matrix is kind of like positive

54
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,540
for a real number.

55
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,300
But we don't know the
eigenvalues of A plus B.

56
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,860
We don't know the
pivots of A plus B.

57
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,870
So we just, like, have to go
down this list of, all right,

58
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,130
which approach to
positive definite

59
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,050
can we get a handle on?

60
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,570
And this is a good one.

61
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,670
This is a good one.

62
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,190
Can we -- how would
we decide that --

63
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,610
if A was like this and
if B was like this,

64
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,410
then we would look at
x transpose A plus B x.

65
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,280
I'm sure this is
in the homework.

66
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,320
Now -- so we have x transpose
A x bigger than zero,

67
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,940
x transpose B x positive
for all -- for all x,

68
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,180
so now I ask you about this

69
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,090
guy.

70
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,800
And of course, you
just add that and that

71
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,940
and we get what we want.

72
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,320
If A and B are positive
definites, so is A plus B.

73
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,810
So that's what I've shown.

74
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,910
So is A plus B.

75
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:27,310
Just -- be sort of ready for
all the approaches through

76
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,260
eigenvalues and through
this expression.

77
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,500
And now, finally, one more
thought about positive definite

78
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,020
is this combination that
came up in least squares.

79
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,260
Can I do that?

80
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:48,290
So now -- now suppose A
is rectangular, m by n.

81
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:58,380
I -- so I'm sorry that
I've used the same letter A

82
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,730
for the positive definite
matrixes in the eigenvalue

83
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,660
chapter that I used way back
in earlier chapters when

84
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,620
the matrix was rectangular.

85
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,750
Now, that matrix --
a rectangular matrix,

86
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,569
no way its positive definite.

87
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:15,360
It's not symmetric.

88
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,450
It's not even square in general.

89
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:25,540
But you remember that the key
for these rectangular ones

90
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,147
was A transpose A.

91
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:28,730
That's square.

92
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:35,630
That's symmetric.

93
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,310
Those are things we knew --

94
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,890
we knew back when
we met this thing

95
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,020
in the least square stuff,
in the projection stuff.

96
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,340
But now we know
something more --

97
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,450
we can ask a more important
question, a deeper question --

98
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,920
is it positive definite?

99
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,770
And we sort of hope so.

100
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,730
Like, we -- we might --

101
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,200
in analogy with
numbers, this is like --

102
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,360
sort of like the square of a
number, and that's positive.

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,930
So now I want to ask
the matrix question.

104
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,350
Is A transpose A
positive definite?

105
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,740
Okay, now it's -- so again,
it's a rectangular A that

106
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,790
I'm starting with, but it's
the combination A transpose A

107
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,150
that's the square, symmetric
and hopefully positive definite

108
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,780
matrix.

109
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,700
So how -- how do I see that
it is positive definite,

110
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,750
or at least positive
semi-definite?

111
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,440
You'll see that.

112
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,280
Well, I don't know the
eigenvalues of this product.

113
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,250
I don't want to work
with the pivots.

114
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:00,060
The right thing -- the right
quantity to look at is this,

115
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,800
x transpose Ax --

116
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,450
A -- x transpose times
my matrix times x.

117
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,280
I'd like to see
that this thing --

118
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,450
that that expression
is always positive.

119
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,310
I'm not doing it with numbers,
I'm doing it with symbols.

120
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,890
Do you see -- how do I see
that that expression comes out

121
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,620
positive?

122
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,260
I'm taking a rectangular
matrix A and an A transpose --

123
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,270
that gives me something
square symmetric,

124
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,030
but now I want to see
that if I multiply --

125
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,970
that if I do this --

126
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,140
I form this quadratic
expression that I

127
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,160
get this positive thing that
goes upwards when I graph it.

128
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,210
How do I see that
that's positive,

129
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,860
or absolutely it
isn't negative anyway?

130
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,990
We'll have to, like, spend
a minute on the question

131
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,620
could it be zero, but
it can't be negative.

132
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,310
Why can this never be negative?

133
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,590
The argument is --

134
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:08,930
like the one key idea in so
many steps in linear algebra --

135
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,960
put those parentheses
in a good way.

136
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,560
Put the parentheses around
Ax and what's the first part?

137
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,280
What's this x
transpose A transpose?

138
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,540
That is Ax transpose.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,810
So what do we have?

140
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,650
We have the length
squared of Ax.

141
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,909
We have -- that's the column
vector Ax that's the row vector

142
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:48,380
Ax, its length squared,
certainly greater than

143
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,310
or possibly equal to zero.

144
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,860
So we have to deal with
this little possibility.

145
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,070
Could it be equal?

146
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,970
Well, when could the
length squared be zero?

147
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,320
Only if the vector
is zero, right?

148
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,340
That's the only vector that
has length squared zero.

149
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,080
So we have -- we
would like to --

150
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,230
I would like to get that
possibility out of there.

151
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,920
So I want to have Ax
never -- never be zero,

152
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,340
except of course
for the zero vector.

153
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,280
How do I assure that
Ax is never zero?

154
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,650
The -- in other words, how do I
show that there's no null space

155
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,370
of A?

156
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,420
The rank should be --

157
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:39,830
so now remember -- what's
the rank when there's no null

158
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,600
space?

159
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,680
By no null space,
you know what I mean.

160
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,370
Only the zero vector
in the null space.

161
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:52,850
So if I have a -- if I
have an 11 by 5 matrix --

162
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:59,230
so it's got 11 rows, 5 columns,
when is there no null space?

163
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,380
So the columns should be
independent -- what's the rank?

164
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,810
n 5 -- rank n.

165
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:12,170
Independent columns,
when -- so if I --

166
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,830
then I conclude yes,
positive definite.

167
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,020
And this was the assumption
-- then A transpose A is

168
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,210
invertible --

169
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,330
the least squares
equations all work fine.

170
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:33,870
And more than that -- the matrix
is even positive definite.

171
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,150
And I just to say one comment
about numerical things,

172
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,770
with a positive definite
matrix, you never

173
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,010
have to do row exchanges.

174
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:50,230
You never run into unsuitably
small numbers or zeroes

175
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,560
in the pivot position.

176
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,960
They're the right -- they're the
great matrixes to compute with,

177
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,250
and they're the great
matrixes to study.

178
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:05,900
So that's -- I wanted to take
this first ten minutes of grab

179
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:12,150
the first ten minutes away from
similar matrixes and continue

180
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,710
a -- this much more
with positive definite.

181
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,270
I'm really at this
point, now, coming close

182
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:24,300
to the end of the heart
of linear algebra.

183
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,160
The positive definiteness
brought everything together.

184
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,920
Similar matrixes, which is
coming the rest of this hour

185
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,400
is a key topic, and
please come on Monday.

186
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,690
Monday is about what's called
the SVD, singular values.

187
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:49,340
It's the -- has become
a central fact in --

188
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,530
a central part of
linear algebra.

189
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,940
I mean, you can come
after Monday also, but --

190
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:04,800
Monday is, -- that singular
value thing has made it

191
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,990
into this course.

192
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,870
Ten years ago, five years
ago it wasn't in the course,

193
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,640
now it has to be.

194
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,490
Okay.

195
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:16,560
So can I begin today's
lecture proper with this idea

196
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,610
of similar matrixes.

197
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,220
This is what similar
matrixes mean.

198
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,680
So here -- let's start again.

199
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,720
I'll write it again.

200
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,690
So A and B are similar.

201
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:33,550
A and B are -- now I'm
-- these matrixes --

202
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,720
I'm no longer talking about
symmetric matrixes, in --

203
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,750
at least no longer expecting
symmetric matrixes.

204
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,960
I'm talking about two
square matrixes n by n.

205
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,790
A and B, they're
n by n matrixes.

206
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,110
And I'm introducing
this word similar.

207
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,880
So I'm going to say
what does it mean?

208
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:08,520
It means that they're
connected in the way --

209
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,920
well, in the way I've written
here, so let me rewrite it.

210
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:24,260
That means that for some matrix
M, which has to be invertible,

211
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,140
because you'll see that --

212
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,680
this one matrix is --

213
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,980
take the other matrix,
multiply on the right

214
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:39,700
by M and on the
left by M inverse.

215
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,810
So the question is,
why that combination?

216
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,890
But part of the answer
you know already.

217
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:52,070
You remember -- we've done this
-- we've taken a matrix A --

218
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:58,620
so let's do an
example of similar.

219
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:06,340
Suppose A -- the matrix A
-- suppose it has a full set

220
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,090
of eigenvectors.

221
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,910
They go in this
eigenvector matrix S.

222
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,220
Then what was the main
point of the whole --

223
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,960
the main calculation of the
whole chapter was -- is --

224
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,380
use that eigenvector
matrix S and its inverse

225
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:33,720
comes over there to produce the
nicest possible matrix lambda.

226
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,160
Nicest possible
because it's diagonal.

227
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:47,615
So in our new language, this is
saying A is similar to lambda.

228
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,440
A is similar to lambda,
because there is a matrix,

229
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,970
and this particular --

230
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,140
there is an M and
this particular M

231
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,220
is this important guy,
this eigenvector matrix.

232
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:13,040
But if I take a different matrix
M and I look at M inverse A M,

233
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,350
the result won't
come out diagonal,

234
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:21,140
but it will come out a
matrix B that's similar to A.

235
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,870
Do you see that I'm --
what I'm doing is, like --

236
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,700
I'm putting these
matrixes into families.

237
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:34,060
All the matrixes in one -- in
the family are similar to each

238
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,070
other.

239
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,080
They're all -- each one in this
family is connected to each

240
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,550
other one by some
matrix M and the --

241
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,660
like the outstanding member of
the family is the diagonal guy.

242
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,700
I mean, that's the
simplest, neatest matrix

243
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,680
in this family of all the
matrixes that are similar to A,

244
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,530
the best one is lambda.

245
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,720
But there are lots of others,
because I can take different --

246
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,870
instead of S, I can
take any old matrix M,

247
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,440
any old invertible
matrix and -- and do it.

248
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,020
I'd better do an example.

249
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,520
Okay.

250
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,901
Suppose I take A as the
matrix two one one two.

251
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:17,400
Okay.

252
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,470
Do you know the eigenvalue
matrix for that?

253
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,630
The eigenvalues of
that matrix are --

254
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:33,040
well, three and one.

255
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,430
So that -- and the eigenvectors
would be easy to find.

256
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,780
So this matrix is
similar to this one.

257
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,080
But my point is --

258
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:49,410
but also, I can also take
my matrix, two one one two,

259
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,090
I could multiply it by
-- let's see, what --

260
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,580
I'm just going to cook
up a matrix M here.

261
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,350
I'm -- I'll -- let me just
invent -- one four one zero.

262
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,710
And over here I'll
put M inverse,

263
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,839
and because I happened
to make that triangular,

264
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,940
I know that its
inverse is that, right?

265
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,819
So there's M inverse A M, that's
going to produce some matrix --

266
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:17,200
oh, well, I've got to
do the multiplication,

267
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,380
so hang on a second, let --

268
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,880
I'll just copy that
one minus four zero one

269
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:33,930
and multiply these guys so I'm
getting two nine one and six,

270
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,010
I think.

271
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,680
Can you check it as I go,
because you -- see I'm just --

272
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,850
so that's two minus four,
I'm getting a minus two nine

273
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,550
minus 24 is a minus 15, my
God, how did I get this?

274
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,935
And that's probably one and six.

275
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,810
So there's my matrix B.

276
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,180
And there's my matrix
lambda, there's my matrix A

277
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,715
and my point is these
are all similar matrixes.

278
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,880
They all have
something in common,

279
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,130
besides being just two by two.

280
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,190
They have something in common.

281
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,310
And that's -- and what is it?

282
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:26,540
What's the point about two
matrixes that are built out

283
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,840
of --

284
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,440
the B is built out
of M inverse A M.

285
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,840
What is it that A
and B have in common?

286
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,127
That's the main -- now I'm
telling you the main fact about

287
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:38,835
similar matrixes.

288
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,910
They have the same eigenvalues.

289
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,550
This is -- this chapter
is about eigenvalues,

290
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,350
and that's why we're interested
in this family of matrixes that

291
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,140
have the same eigenvalues.

292
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,640
What are the eigenvalues
in this example?

293
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,570
Lambda.

294
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,070
The eigenvalues of
that I could compute.

295
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:06,370
The eigenvalues of that I
can compute really fast.

296
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,330
So the eigenvalues
are three and one --

297
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,940
for this for sure.

298
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,520
Now did we -- do you see why the
eigenvalues are three and one

299
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,930
for that one?

300
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,870
If I tell you the eigenvalues
are three and one, you prick --

301
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,190
quickly process the trace,
which is -- and four --

302
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,510
agrees with four and you
process the determinant,

303
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,990
three times one --

304
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,930
the determinant is three
and you say yes, it's right.

305
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:39,540
Now I'm hoping that the
eigenvalues of this thing

306
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,770
are three and one.

307
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,450
May I process the trace and
the determinant for that one?

308
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,830
What's the trace here?

309
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,510
The trace of this matrix
is four minus two and six,

310
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,320
and that's what it should be.

311
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,210
What's the determinant minus
twelve plus fifteen is three.

312
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,390
The determinant is three.

313
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,190
The eigenvalues of that
matrix are also three and one.

314
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,460
And you see I created
this matrix just like --

315
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,600
I just took any M, like,
one that popped into my head

316
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,030
and computed M inverse
A M, got that matrix,

317
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:22,980
it didn't look anything
special but it's --

318
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,290
like A itself, it has those
eigenvalues three and one.

319
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,370
So that's the main fact
and let me write it down.

320
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:45,290
Similar matrixes have
the same eigenvalues.

321
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:51,590
So I'll just put that
as an important point.

322
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,890
And think why.

323
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,430
Why is that?

324
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,120
So that's what that
family of matrixes is.

325
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,940
The matrixes that
are similar to this A

326
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,610
here are all the matrixes with
eigenvalues three and one.

327
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,450
Every matrix with
eigenvalues three and one,

328
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,870
there's some M that
connects this guy

329
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,810
to the one you think of.

330
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,840
And then of course, the most
special guy in the whole family

331
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,690
is the diagonal one with
eigenvalues three and one

332
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,630
sitting there on the diagonal.

333
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,590
But also, I could find --

334
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,130
I mean, tell me just a couple
more members of the family.

335
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:38,070
Another -- tell me another
matrix that has eigenvalues

336
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,680
three and one.

337
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,740
Well, let's see, I -- oh,
I'll just make it triangular.

338
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,180
That's in the family.

339
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,840
There is some M that --
that connects to this one.

340
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,310
And -- and also this.

341
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,630
There's some matrix M -- so that
M inverse A M comes out to be

342
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,180
that.

343
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,290
There's a whole family here.

344
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:11,710
And they all share
the same eigenvalues.

345
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,320
So why is that?

346
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:14,930
Okay.

347
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:21,880
I'm going to start -- the only
possibility is to start with Ax

348
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,180
equal lambda x.

349
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,790
Okay, so suppose A has
the eigenvalue lambda.

350
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,880
Now I want to get B into
the picture here somehow.

351
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,930
You remember B is M inverse A M.

352
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,910
Let's just remember
that over here.

353
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:44,390
B is M inverse A M.

354
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,030
And I want to see
its eigenvalues.

355
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,520
How I going to get M inverse
A M into this equation?

356
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,830
Let me just sort of do it.

357
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,970
I'll put an M times an M
inverse in there, right?

358
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,870
That was --

359
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,100
I haven't changed
the left-hand side,

360
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,420
so I better not change
the right-hand side.

361
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,850
So everybody's okay so far,
I just put in there -- see,

362
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,240
I want to get a -- so now
I'll multiply on the left by M

363
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,870
inverse --

364
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,200
I have to do the
same to this side

365
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,880
and that number
lambda's just a number,

366
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,380
so it factors out in the front.

367
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:32,370
So what I have here
is this was safe.

368
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,760
I did the same
thing to both sides.

369
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,090
And now I've got B.

370
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,270
There's B.

371
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:42,210
That's B times this
vector M inverse

372
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:47,670
x is equal to lambda times
this vector M inverse x.

373
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,920
So what have I learned?

374
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,980
I've learned that
B times some vector

375
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,600
is lambda times that vector.

376
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,910
I've learned that lambda
is an eigenvalue of B also.

377
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,370
So this is -- if
-- so this is --

378
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:05,600
if lambda's an eigenvalue of
A, then I can write it this way

379
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,110
and I discover that
lambda's an eigenvalue of B.

380
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,240
That's the end of the proof.

381
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,670
The eigenvector
didn't stay the same.

382
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,410
Of course I don't expect the
eigenvectors to stay the same.

383
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,240
If all the eigenvalues are the
same and all the eigenvectors

384
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,120
are the same, then probably
the matrix is the same.

385
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,260
Here the eigenvector changes,
so the eigenvector --

386
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:38,370
so the point is then
the eigenvector of B --

387
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:44,880
of B is M inverse times
the eigenvector of A.

388
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,380
Okay.

389
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:53,280
That's all that this says here.

390
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,940
The eigenvector of A was
X, and so the M inverse --

391
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,930
similar matrixes, then
have the same eigenvalues

392
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,070
and their eigenvectors
are just moved around.

393
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,790
Of course, that's what we --
that's what happened way back

394
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,580
--

395
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:15,070
and the most important similar
matrixes are to diagonalize.

396
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,140
So what was the point
when we diagonalized?

397
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,830
The eigenvalues stayed
the same, of course.

398
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,380
Three and one.

399
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,150
What about the eigenvectors?

400
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,190
The eigenvectors were whatever
they were for the matrix A,

401
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,340
but then what were
the eigenvectors

402
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,630
for the diagonal matrix?

403
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,370
They're just -- what are the
eigenvectors of a diagonal

404
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:37,900
matrix?

405
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,130
They're just one
zero and zero one.

406
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,290
So this step made the
eigenvectors nice,

407
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:49,750
didn't change the
eigenvalues, and every time we

408
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,580
don't change the eigenvalues.

409
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,021
Same eigenvalues.

410
00:25:53,021 --> 00:25:53,520
Okay.

411
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:01,100
Now -- so I've got all
these matrixes in --

412
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:07,380
I've got this family of matrixes
with eigenvalues three and one.

413
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,610
Fine.

414
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,270
That's a nice family.

415
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:15,520
It's nice because those two
eigenvalues are different.

416
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,280
I now have to --

417
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,460
to get into that --

418
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:25,320
the -- into the less happy
possibility that the two

419
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,960
eigenvalues could be the

420
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,680
same.

421
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,940
And then it's a little
trickier, because you remember

422
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,360
when two eigenvalues
are the same,

423
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,400
what's the bad possibility?

424
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,030
That there might
not be enough --

425
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,730
a full set of eigenvectors
and we might not be able

426
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,080
to diagonalize.

427
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,550
So I need to discuss
the bad case.

428
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,070
So the bad -- can
I just say bad?

429
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:03,707
If lambda one equals
lambda two, then the matrix

430
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:04,873
might not be diagonalizable.

431
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,010
Suppose lambda one equals
lambda two equals four,

432
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:11,510
say.

433
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:20,990
Now if I look at the family of
matrixes with eigenvalues four

434
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,840
and four, well, one
possibility occurs to me.

435
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:38,120
One family with eigenvalues four
and four has this matrix in it,

436
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,420
four times the identity.

437
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:46,400
Then another -- but now I want
to ask also about the matrix

438
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,930
four four one zero.

439
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,290
And my point -- here's
the whole point of this --

440
00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:00,107
of this bad stuff, is that this
guy is not in the same family

441
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:00,690
with that one.

442
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,310
The family of a -- of matrixes
that have eigenvalues four

443
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,760
and four is two families.

444
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:16,081
There's this total loner
here who's in a family off --

445
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:16,580
right?

446
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,890
Just by himself.

447
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:23,070
And all the others
are in with this guy.

448
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:35,090
So the big family
includes this one.

449
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,720
And it includes a whole lot
of other matrixes, all --

450
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,310
in fact, in this two by two
case, it -- you see where --

451
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:48,290
what do I mean -- so what I
using, this word family --

452
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,980
in a family, I mean
they're similar.

453
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,570
So my point is that the only
matrix that's similar to this

454
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,840
is itself.

455
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,240
The only matrix that's similar
to four times the identity

456
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,650
is four times the identity.

457
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,320
It's off by itself.

458
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,360
Why is that?

459
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,750
The -- if this is my matrix,
four times the identity,

460
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:17,150
and I take it, I multiply on
the right by any matrix M,

461
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:22,430
I multiply on the left by
M inverse, what do I get?

462
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:28,720
This is any M, but
what's the result?

463
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,930
Well, factoring
out a four, that's

464
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,710
just the identity
matrix in there.

465
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,250
So then the M inverse
cancels the M,

466
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,420
so I've just got this
matrix back again.

467
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,310
So whatever the M
is, I'm not getting

468
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,610
any more members of the family.

469
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:57,680
So this is one small family,
because it only has one person.

470
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,610
One matrix, excuse me.

471
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,200
I think of these matrixes
as people by this point,

472
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,110
in eighteen oh six.

473
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,990
Okay, the other family
includes all the rest --

474
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:13,930
all other matrixes that have
eigenvalues four and four.

475
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:20,290
This is somehow the
best one in that family.

476
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,870
See, I can't make it diagonal.

477
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,580
If I -- if it's
diagonal, it's this one.

478
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,020
It's in its own, by itself.

479
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,250
So I have to think, okay,
what's the nearest I

480
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,480
can get to diagonal?

481
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,380
But it will not
be diagonalizable.

482
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,670
That -- do you know that that
matrix is not diagonalizable?

483
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,050
Of course, because if
it was diagonalizable,

484
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:46,150
it would be similar to
that, which it isn't.

485
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,540
The eigenvalues of
this are four and four,

486
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,960
but what's the catch
with that matrix?

487
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,430
It's only got one eigenvector.

488
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,560
That's a
non-diagonalizable matrix.

489
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,340
Only one eigenvector.

490
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:06,700
And somehow, if I made that
one into a ten or to a million,

491
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,540
I could find an M, it's in
the family, it's similar.

492
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,570
But the best -- so the best
guy in this family is this one.

493
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:19,810
And this is called the Jordan --

494
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:24,800
so this guy Jordan picked
out -- so he, like, studied,

495
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,250
these families of
matrixes, and each family,

496
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,740
he picked out the nicest,
most diagonal one.

497
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,960
But not completely diagonal,
because there's nobody --

498
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,430
there isn't a diagonal
matrix in this family,

499
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:44,780
so there's a one up
there in the Jordan form.

500
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,010
Okay.

501
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:50,699
I think we've got to see some
more matrixes in that family.

502
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:52,990
So, all right, let me --
let's just think of some other

503
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:58,570
matrixes whose eigenvalues are
four and four but they're not

504
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,220
four times the identity.

505
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,130
So -- and I believe that --

506
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,660
that this -- that all the
examples we pick up will be

507
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:13,320
similar to each other
and -- do you see why --

508
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,340
in this topic of
similar matrixes,

509
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,820
the climax is the Jordan form.

510
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,910
So it says that every matrix --

511
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:29,310
I'll write down what the Jordan
form -- what Jordan discovered.

512
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:35,030
He found the best looking
matrix in each family.

513
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:41,080
And that's -- then we've got --
then we've covered all matrixes

514
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,540
including the
non-diagonalizable one.

515
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,060
That -- that's the
point, that in some way,

516
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,430
Jordan completed the
diagonalization by coming

517
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,890
as near as he could,
which is his Jordan form.

518
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,340
And therefore, if you want
to cover all matrixes,

519
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,720
you've got to get
him in the picture.

520
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,030
It used to be -- when
I took eighteen oh six,

521
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:07,530
that was the climax of the
course, this Jordan form stuff.

522
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:11,490
I think it's not the climax
of linear algebra anymore,

523
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,930
because --

524
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:20,590
it's not easy to
find this Jordan form

525
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:25,340
for a general matrix, because
it depends on these eigenvalues

526
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,900
being exactly the same.

527
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,620
You'd have to know exactly
the eigenvalues and it --

528
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,270
and you'd have to know exactly
the rank and the slightest

529
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:39,180
change in numbers will
change those eigenvalues,

530
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,320
change the rank and therefore
the whole thing is numerically

531
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,970
not an -- a good thing.

532
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:51,180
But for algebra,
it's the right thing

533
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,660
to understand this family.

534
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,600
So just tell me another matrix
-- a few more matrixes --

535
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:03,380
so more members of the family.

536
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:11,380
Let me put down again
what the best one is.

537
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,400
Okay.

538
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,409
All right.

539
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:14,690
Some more matrixes.

540
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,659
Let's see, what I looking for?

541
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:22,750
I'm looking for matrixes
whose trace is what?

542
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,190
So if I'm looking for more
matrixes in the family,

543
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,290
they'll all have the same
eigenvalues, four and four.

544
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,449
So their trace will be eight.

545
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:34,120
So why don't I just take,
like, five and three --

546
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:40,540
I've got the trace right, now
the determinant should be what?

547
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,469
Sixteen.

548
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:45,370
So I just fix this up -- shall I
put maybe a one and a minus one

549
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,771
there?

550
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:47,270
Okay.

551
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:52,139
There's a matrix with
eigenvalues four and four,

552
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,719
because the trace is eight and
the determinant is sixteen.

553
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,670
And I don't think
it's diagonalizable.

554
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,800
Do you know why it's
not diagonalizable?

555
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,470
Because if it was
diagonalizable,

556
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,505
the diagonal form
would have to be this.

557
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,980
But I can't get to that
form, because whatever

558
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,880
I do with any M inverse and
M I stay with that form.

559
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,320
I could never get
-- connect those.

560
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,470
So I can put down more
members -- here --

561
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,810
here's another easy one.

562
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,960
I could put the four and
the four and a seventeen

563
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,580
down there.

564
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,080
All these matrixes are similar.

565
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,350
If I'm -- I could find an M
that would show that that one is

566
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,350
similar to that one.

567
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,420
And in -- you can see the
general picture is I can take

568
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:45,710
any a and any 8-a here and
any -- oh, I don't know,

569
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,200
whatever you put it'd be
-- anyway, you can see.

570
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:54,890
I can fill this in, fill this in
to make the trace equal eight,

571
00:35:54,890 --> 00:36:01,160
the determinant equal 16, I
get all that family of matrixes

572
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,635
and they're all similar.

573
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:08,250
So we see what eigenvalues do.

574
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:13,020
They're all similar and they
all have only one eigenvector.

575
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,610
So I -- if I'm -- if
you were going to --

576
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:20,780
allow me to add to this picture,
they have the same lambdas

577
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:25,799
and they also have the
same number of independent

578
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:26,340
eigenvectors.

579
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,910
Because if I get an eigenvector
for x I get one for -- for A,

580
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,260
I get one for B also.

581
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:43,170
So -- and same number
of eigenvectors.

582
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,740
But even more than that --

583
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,048
even more than that --

584
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:49,173
I mean, it's not enough
just to count eigenvectors.

585
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,450
Yes, let me give you an
example why it's not even

586
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:58,460
enough to count eigenvectors.

587
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,170
So another example.

588
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:04,210
So here are some matrixes --

589
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,600
oh, let me make
them four by four --

590
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,260
okay, here -- here's a matrix.

591
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,570
I mean, like if you
want nightmares,

592
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:14,480
think about matrixes like these.

593
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,670
Uh, so a one off the diagonal
-- say a one there, how many --

594
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,600
what are the eigenvalues
of that matrix?

595
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,040
Oh, I mean --

596
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,480
okay.

597
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,550
What are the eigenvalues
of that matrix?

598
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,910
Please.

599
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,160
Four 0s, right?

600
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,930
So we're really getting
bad matrixes now.

601
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,080
So I mean, this is, like --

602
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:53,190
Jordan was a good guy, but he
had to think about matrixes

603
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:58,590
that all -- that had, like -- an
eigenvalue repeated four times.

604
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,140
How many eigenvectors
does that matrix have?

605
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,980
Well, I'm --
eigenvectors will be --

606
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,710
since the eigenvalue is
zero, eigenvectors will be

607
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,350
in the null space, right?

608
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:17,870
I'm -- eigenvectors have
got to be A x equal zero x.

609
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,340
So what's the dimension
of the null space?

610
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,110
Two.

611
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,920
Somebody said two.

612
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,680
And that's right.

613
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,690
How -- why?

614
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,390
Because you ask what's
the rank of that matrix,

615
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,410
the rank is obviously two.

616
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,050
The number of
independent rows is two,

617
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,880
the number of independent
columns is two,

618
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,430
the rank is two so the null --
the dimension of the null space

619
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,950
is four minus two, so
it's got two eigenvectors.

620
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,500
Two eigenvectors.

621
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,441
Two independent eigenvectors.

622
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:49,940
All right.

623
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:55,260
The dimension of the
null space is two.

624
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,905
Now, suppose I change
this zero to a seven.

625
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:11,840
The eigenvalues are all still
zero, how -- what about --

626
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,756
how many eigenvectors?

627
00:39:15,449 --> 00:39:17,990
What's the dimension of the --
what's the rank of this matrix

628
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,160
now?

629
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,890
Still two, right?

630
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,820
So it's okay.

631
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,370
And actually, this would
be similar to the one that

632
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,800
had a zero in there.

633
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,740
But it's not as beautiful,
Jordan picked this one.

634
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,850
He picked -- he put ones --

635
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:39,000
we have a one on the -- above
the diagonal for every missing

636
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,330
eigenvector, and here we're
missing two because we've got

637
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,550
two, so we've got two
eigenvectors and two are

638
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:53,860
missing, because it's
a four by four matrix.

639
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:58,910
Okay, now -- but I was going to
give you this second example.

640
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,145
0 1 0 0, let me
just move the one.

641
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,500
Oop, not there.

642
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,710
Off the diagonal and
zero zero zero zero zero.

643
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,210
Okay.

644
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,570
So now tell me
about this matrix.

645
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:27,460
Its eigenvalues are
four zeroes again.

646
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,910
Its rank is two again.

647
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:36,670
So it has two eigenvectors
and two missing.

648
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:40,890
But the darn thing is
not similar to that one.

649
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,430
A -- a count of eigenvectors
looks like these could be

650
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:47,130
similar, but they're not.

651
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:52,720
Jordan -- see, this is like --
a little three by three block

652
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,880
and a little one by one block.

653
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,770
And this one is like a
two by two block and a two

654
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:03,080
by two block, and those blocks
are called Jordan blocks.

655
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,770
So let me say what
is a Jordan block?

656
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:17,400
J block number I has --

657
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,660
so a Jordan block has a repeated
eigenvalue, lambda I, lambda I

658
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,530
on the diagonal.

659
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,905
Zeroes below and ones above.

660
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:34,160
So there's a block
with this guy repeated,

661
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,070
but it only has one eigenvector.

662
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,900
So a Jordan block has
one eigenvector only.

663
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,720
This one has one eigenvector,
this block has one eigenvector

664
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,580
and we get two.

665
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,170
This block has one
eigenvector and that block has

666
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,980
one eigenvector and we get two.

667
00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:02,020
So -- but the blocks
are different sizes.

668
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,540
And that -- it turns
out Jordan worked out --

669
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:14,190
then this is not similar,
not similar to this one.

670
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,140
So the -- so I'm, like,
giving you the whole story --

671
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,780
well, not the whole story, but
the main themes of the story --

672
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,700
is here's Jordan's theorem.

673
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:49,060
Every square matrix A is
similar to A Jordan matrix J.

674
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,890
And what's a Jordan matrix J?

675
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:56,670
It's a matrix with
these blocks, block --

676
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:03,850
Jordan block number one, Jordan
block number two and so on.

677
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:07,950
And let's say Jordan
block number d.

678
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,760
And those Jordan
blocks look like that,

679
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,760
so the eigenvalues are
sitting on the diagonal,

680
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,750
but we've got some of these
ones above the diagonal.

681
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,010
We've got the number of --

682
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,530
so the number of blocks --

683
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:37,510
the number of blocks is
the number of eigenvectors,

684
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:42,510
because we get one
eigenvector per block.

685
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:47,250
So what I'm -- so if I
summarize Jordan's idea --

686
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,570
start with any A.

687
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:54,080
If its eigenvalues are
distinct, then what's it similar

688
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,700
to?

689
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,430
This is the good case.

690
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:00,710
if I start with a matrix A and
it has different eigenvalues --

691
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:03,450
it's n eigenvalues, none
of them are repeated,

692
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:09,350
then that's a diagonal --
diagonalizable matrix --

693
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:13,990
the Jordan blocks is -- has --
the Jordan matrix is diagonal.

694
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,900
It's lambda.

695
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,840
So the good case --

696
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,590
the good case, J is lambda.

697
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,400
All -- there are --

698
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:29,900
d=n.

699
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,830
There are n eigenvectors, n
blocks, diagonal, everything

700
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,640
great.

701
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,990
But Jordan covered
all cases by including

702
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:44,460
these cases of repeated
eigenvalues and missing

703
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,100
eigenvectors.

704
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:47,810
Okay.

705
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,640
That's a description of Jordan.

706
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,030
That -- that's --

707
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:54,300
I haven't told you how
to compute this thing,

708
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,500
and it isn't easy.

709
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,920
Whereas the good case is the --
the good case is what 18.06 is

710
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,660
about.

711
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:07,040
The -- this case is what
18.06 was about 20 years ago.

712
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,220
So you can see you probably
won't have on the final exam

713
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:18,540
the computation of a Jordan
matrix for some horrible thing

714
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,720
with four repeated eigenvalues.

715
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:28,730
I'm not that crazy
about the Jordan form.

716
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:34,950
But I'm very positive about
positive definite matrixes

717
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:38,880
and about the idea
that's coming Monday,

718
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,964
the singular value
decomposition.

719
00:45:40,964 --> 00:45:43,130
So I'll see you on Monday,
and have a great weekend.

720
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,680
Bye.
