1
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,436
OK, this lecture is
like the beginning

2
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:13,060
of the second half
of this is to prove.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,590
this course because up to now
we paid a lot of attention

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,240
to rectangular matrices.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,020
Now, concentrating
on square matrices,

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,150
so we're at two big topics.

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,210
The determinant of
a square matrix,

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,040
so this is the first
lecture in that new chapter

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,940
on determinants, and the
reason, the big reason

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,030
we need the determinants
is for the Eigen values.

11
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,420
So this is really
determinants and Eigen values,

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,330
the next big, big
chunk of 18.06.

13
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:57,100
OK, so the determinant
is a number associated

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,360
with every square matrix,
so every square matrix

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,160
has this number associated with
called the, its determinant.

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:15,720
I'll often write it as D E T A
or often also I'll write it as,

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,440
A with vertical bars,
so that's going to mean

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,030
the determinant of the matrix.

19
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,400
That's going to mean this
one, like, magic number.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,420
Well, one number can't tell
you what the whole matrix was.

21
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,960
But this one number, just
packs in as much information

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,310
as possible into
a single number,

23
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,250
and of course the one fact
that you've seen before

24
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,280
and we have to see it
again is the matrix

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,680
is invertible when the
determinant is not zero.

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,260
The matrix is singular when
the determinant is zero.

27
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,590
So the determinant will be
a test for invertibility,

28
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,430
but the determinant's got
a lot more to it than that,

29
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,889
so let me start.

30
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,260
OK, now the question
is how to start.

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,850
Do I give you a big formula
for the determinant,

32
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,600
all in one gulp?

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,190
I don't think so!

34
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,410
That big formula has got
too much packed in it.

35
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:28,900
I would rather start with three
properties of the determinant,

36
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,150
three properties that it has.

37
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,990
And let me tell
you property one.

38
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:39,380
The determinant of
the identity is one.

39
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,670
OK.

40
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,710
I...

41
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,540
I wish the other
two properties were

42
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,810
as easy to tell you as that.

43
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,490
But actually the second property
is pretty straightforward too,

44
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,050
and then once we get the
third we will actually

45
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,780
have the determinant.

46
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,240
Those three properties define
the determinant and we can --

47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:13,610
then we can figure out, well,
what is the determinant?

48
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,880
What's a formula for it?

49
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,000
Now, the second property
is what happens if you

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,620
exchange two rows of a matrix.

51
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,040
What happens to the determinant?

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,000
So, property two
is exchange rows,

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:46,390
reverse the sign
of the determinant.

54
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,360
A lot of plus and minus signs.

55
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,150
I even wrote here,
"plus and minus signs,"

56
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,880
because this is,
like, that's what

57
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,570
you have to pay attention
to in the formulas

58
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,080
and properties of determinants.

59
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,200
So that -- you see what I
mean by a property here?

60
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,890
I haven't yet told you
what the determinant is,

61
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,890
but whatever it
is, if I exchange

62
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,910
two rows to get a different
matrix that reverses

63
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,950
the sign of the determinant.

64
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,180
And so now, actually,
what matrices

65
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,140
do we now know the
determinant of?

66
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,260
From one and two, I now
know the determinant.

67
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,640
Well, I certainly know the
determinant of the identity

68
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,210
matrix and now I
know the determinant

69
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,970
of every other matrix that
comes from row exchanges

70
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,540
from the identities still.

71
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,460
So what matrices have
I gotten at this point?

72
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,500
The permutations, right.

73
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,020
At this point I know
every permutation matrix,

74
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,730
so now I'm saying the
determinant of a permutation

75
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,690
matrix is one or minus one.

76
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:09,320
One or minus one, depending
whether the number of exchanges

77
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:16,720
was even or the number
of exchanges was odd.

78
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,100
So this is the determinant
of a permutation.

79
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,720
Now, P is back to
standing for permutation.

80
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,560
OK.

81
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,180
if I could carry on this
board, I could, like,

82
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,940
do the two-by-two's.

83
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,790
So, property one tells me
that this two-by-two matrix.

84
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,560
Oh, I better write absolute --

85
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,150
I mean, I'd better write
vertical bars, not brackets,

86
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,770
for that determinant.

87
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,890
Property one said, in
the two-by-two case,

88
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,700
that this matrix
has determinant one.

89
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:59,130
Property two tells me that
this matrix has determinant --

90
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,500
what?

91
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,740
Negative one.

92
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,530
This is, like, two-by-twos.

93
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,090
Now, I finally want to get --

94
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,210
well, ultimately
I want to get to,

95
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,130
the formula that we all know.

96
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,600
Let me put that way over
here, that the determinant

97
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:23,190
of a general
two-by-two is ad-bc.

98
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:23,690
OK.

99
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,070
I'm going to leave that up,
like, as the two by two case

100
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,190
I'm down to the product of the
diagonal and if I transpose,

101
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,065
that we already know,
so that every property,

102
00:06:26,065 --> 00:06:44,980
I can, like, check that it's
correct for two-by-twos.

103
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,960
But the whole point
of these properties

104
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,850
is that they're going to
give me a formula for n-by-n.

105
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,760
That's the whole point.

106
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,060
They're going to give
me this number that's

107
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,460
a test for invertibility
and other great properties

108
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,240
for any size matrix.

109
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,500
OK, now you see I'm like,
slowing down because property

110
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,220
three is the key property.

111
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,570
Property three is the key
property and can I somehow

112
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,500
describe it -- maybe I'll
separate it into 3A I said that

113
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,610
if you do a row exchange,
the determinant and 3B.

114
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,750
Property 3A says that if I
multiply one of the rows,

115
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:40,020
say the first row,
by a number T --

116
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,590
I'm going to erase that.

117
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,150
That's, like, what I'm headed
for but I'm not there yet.

118
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,890
It's the one we know
and you'll see that it's

119
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:54,990
checked out by each property.

120
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,220
OK, so this is for any matrix.

121
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,990
For any matrix, if I
multiply one row by T

122
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,740
and leave the other row
or other n-1 rows alone,

123
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,220
what happens to the determinant?

124
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,610
The factor T comes out.

125
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,260
It's T times this determinant.

126
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,230
That's not hard.

127
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,560
I shouldn't have made a big
deal out of property 3A,

128
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,630
and 3B is that, if
is, is if I keep --

129
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,640
I'm always keeping this
second row the same,

130
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,929
or that last n-1 rows
are all staying the same.

131
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,460
I'm just working --

132
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,679
I'm just looking inside
the first row and if I have

133
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:53,770
an a+a' there and
a b+b' there --

134
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,480
sorry, I didn't.

135
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,150
Ahh.

136
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,690
Why don't -- I'll use
an eraser, do it right.

137
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,190
b+b' there.

138
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,390
You see what I'm doing?

139
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,730
This property and this property
are about linear combinations,

140
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:13,720
of the first row only, leaving
the other rows unchanged.

141
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,680
They'll copy along.

142
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,320
Then, then I get the sum -- this
breaks up into the sum of this

143
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,500
determinant and this one.

144
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,120
I'm putting up formulas.

145
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,850
Maybe I can try to
say it in words.

146
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,110
The determinant is
a linear function.

147
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:48,170
It behaves like a linear
function of first row

148
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,540
if all the other
rows stay the same.

149
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,340
I not saying that --

150
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,640
let me emphasize.

151
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,860
I not saying that the
determinant of A plus B

152
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:07,870
is determinant of A
plus determinant of B.

153
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,180
I not saying that.

154
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,490
I'd better -- can I --

155
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,620
how do I get it onto tape
that I'm not saying that?

156
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:22,350
You see, this would allow
all the rows -- you know,

157
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,830
A to have a bunch of rows,
B to have a bunch of rows.

158
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,510
That's not the
linearity I'm after.

159
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,840
I'm only after
linearity in each row.

160
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,030
Linear for each row.

161
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,990
Well, you may say I only
talked about the first row,

162
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,610
but I claim it's also
linear in the second row,

163
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,520
if I had this -- but not,
I can't, I can't have

164
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,320
a combination in both
first and second.

165
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,830
If I had a combination
in the second row,

166
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,230
then I could use rule two to
put it up in the first row,

167
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,560
use my property and then use
rule two again to put it back,

168
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,340
so each row is OK, not
only the first row,

169
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,370
but each row separately.

170
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,760
OK, those are the
three properties,

171
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,030
and from those
properties, so that's

172
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,660
properties one, two, three.

173
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,584
From those, I want to get all --

174
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:33,750
I'm going to learn a lot
more about the determinant.

175
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,030
Let me take an example.

176
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,990
What would I like to learn?

177
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,280
I would like to learn that --
so here's our property four.

178
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,310
Let me use the same
numbering as here.

179
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:58,720
Property four is if two rows are
equal, the determinant is zero.

180
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,720
OK, so property four.

181
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:13,570
Two equal rows lead to
determinant equals zero.

182
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,280
Right.

183
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,360
Now, of course I can -- in the
two-by-two case I can check,

184
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,980
sure, the determinant
of ab ab comes out zero.

185
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,950
But I want to see why
it's true for n-by-n.

186
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:36,100
Suppose row one equals row three
for a seven-by-seven matrix.

187
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,070
So two rows are the
same in a big matrix.

188
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,350
And all I have to work
with is these properties.

189
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,540
The exchange property,
which flips the sign,

190
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:53,580
and the linearity property which
works in each row separately.

191
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,170
OK, can you see the reason?

192
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:02,200
How do I get this one out of
properties one, two, three?

193
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,680
Because -- that's all
I have to work with.

194
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,770
Everything has to come from
properties one, two, three.

195
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:12,040
OK, so suppose I have a
matrix, and two rows are even.

196
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,310
How do I see that
its determinant

197
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:22,120
has to be zero from
these properties?

198
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,490
I do an exchange.

199
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,190
Property two is just
set up for this.

200
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,610
Use property two.

201
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,090
Use exchange -- exchange rows.

202
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:40,720
Exchange those rows, and
I get the same matrix.

203
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,700
Of course, because
those rows were equal.

204
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,580
So the determinant
didn't change.

205
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,360
But on the other
hand, property two

206
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,170
says that the sign did change.

207
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,350
So the -- so I, I have
a determinant whose sign

208
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,390
doesn't change and does change,
and the only possibility then

209
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,520
is that the determinant is zero.

210
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,780
You see the reasoning there?

211
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,550
Straightforward.

212
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:15,250
Property two just told us, hey,
if we've got two equal rows we.

213
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,210
we've got a zero determinant.

214
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,140
And of course in our minds,
that matches the fact

215
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,550
that if I have two equal rows
the matrix isn't invertible.

216
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,430
If I have two equal rows,
I know that the rank

217
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,190
is less changes sign. than n.

218
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,540
OK, ready for property five.

219
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,900
Now, property five
you'll recognize as P.

220
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:45,710
It says that the elimination
step that I'm always doing,

221
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:51,850
or U and U transposed, when
they're triangular,4 subtract

222
00:14:51,850 --> 00:15:00,560
a multiple, subtract some
multiple l times row one from

223
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,800
another row, row k, let's say.

224
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,760
You remember why I did that.

225
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,620
In elimination I'm always
choosing this multiplier so as

226
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,190
to produce zero
in that position.

227
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,050
What I -- way, way
back in property two,4

228
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,230
Or row I from row k,
maybe I should just

229
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,250
make very clear that there's
nothing special about row one

230
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,530
here.

231
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,400
OK, so that, you can see
why I want that who cares?

232
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,350
one, because that
will allow me to start

233
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,890
with this full matrix whose
determinant I don't know,

234
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:45,590
and I can do elimination
and clean it out.

235
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,830
I can get zeroes
below the diagonal

236
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,970
by these elimination
steps and the point

237
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:58,420
is that the determinant, the
determinant doesn't change.

238
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,450
So all those steps
of elimination

239
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,070
are OK not changing
the determinant.

240
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,580
In our language in the early
chapter the determinant of A is

241
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,900
So if I do seven row
exchanges, the determinant

242
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,989
changes sign, going to be the
same as the determinant of U,

243
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:25,030
the upper triangular one.

244
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,090
It just has the pivots
on the diagonal.

245
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,100
That's why we'll
want this property.

246
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,250
OK, do you see where that
property's coming from?

247
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,110
Let me do the two-by-two case.

248
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,490
Let me do the
two-by-two case here.

249
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,340
So, I'll keep property
five going along.

250
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,300
So what I doing?

251
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,890
I'm going to keep --

252
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,910
I'm going to have
ab cd, but I'm going

253
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,460
to subtract l times the first
row from the second row.

254
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:03,182
And that's the
determinant and of

255
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:03,890
OK, that's not --

256
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,260
I didn't put in every
comma and, course

257
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,900
I can multiply that out and
figure out, sure enough, ad-bc

258
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:17,849
is there and this minus
ALB plus ALB cancels out,

259
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,569
but I just cheated,

260
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,190
right?

261
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,760
I've got to use the properties.

262
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,510
So what property?

263
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,599
Well, of course,
this is a com --

264
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,420
I'm keeping the first row
the same and the second row

265
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,690
has a c and a d,
and then there's

266
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:36,190
the determinant of the A
and the B, and the minus LA,

267
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,240
and the minus LB.

268
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,150
So what property was that?

269
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,420
3B.

270
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,340
I kept one row
the same and I had

271
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,690
a combination in the
second, in the other row,

272
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,520
and I just separated it out.

273
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,300
OK, so that's property 3.

274
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,350
That's by number
3, 3B if you like.

275
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,980
OK, now use 3A.

276
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:10,480
How do you use 3A, which
says I can factor out an l,

277
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,110
I can factor out a minus l here.

278
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,140
I can factor a minus l out
from this row, no problem.

279
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,000
That was 3A.

280
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,390
So now I've used property three
and now I'm ready for the kill.

281
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:32,070
Property four says that
this determinant is zero,

282
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,810
has two equal rows.

283
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,100
You see how that
would always work?

284
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,280
I subtract a multiple of
one row from another one.

285
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,860
It gives me a combination in
row k of the old row and l times

286
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,310
this copy of the higher
row, and then if --

287
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,550
since I have two equal
rows, that's zero,

288
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,990
so the determinant after
elimination is the same

289
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,280
as before.

290
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,430
Good.

291
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,310
OK.

292
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,170
Now, let's see -- if
I rescue my glasses,

293
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,140
I can see what's property six.

294
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,700
Oh, six is easy,
plenty of space.

295
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:22,450
Row of zeroes leads to
determinant of A equals zero.

296
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,380
A complete row of zeroes.

297
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,550
So I'm again, this
is like, something

298
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,880
I'll use in the singular case.

299
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,380
Actually, you can look ahead
to why I need these properties.

300
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,220
So I'm going to use property
five, the elimination,

301
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,980
use this stuff to say
that this determinant is

302
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,600
the same as that determinant
and I'll produce a zero there.

303
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,910
But what if I also
produce a zero there?

304
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,620
What if elimination
gives a row of zeroes?

305
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,120
That, that used to be my
test for, mmm, singular,

306
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,220
not invertible, rank
two -- rank less than N,

307
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,120
and now I'm seeing it's
also gives determinant zero.

308
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,600
How do I get that one from
the previous properties?

309
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,006
'Cause I -- this
is not a new law,

310
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,630
this has got to come
from the old ones.

311
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,635
So what shall I do?

312
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,690
Yeah, use -- that's brilliant.

313
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,430
If you use 3A with
T equals zero.

314
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,350
Right.

315
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:32,760
So I have this zero
zero cd, and I'm

316
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,850
trying to show that that
determinant is zero. triangular

317
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,560
matrices, l and l transposed,

318
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,000
OK, so the zero is
the same is -- five,

319
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,900
can I take T equals five,
just to, like, pin it down?

320
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,530
I'll multiply this row by five.

321
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,780
Five, well then, five
of this should -- if I,

322
00:20:52,780 --> 00:21:01,300
if there's a factor five
in that, you see what --

323
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,500
so this is property 3A,
with taking T as five.

324
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,660
If I multiply a row by
five, out comes a five.

325
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:14,450
So why I doing this?

326
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:19,320
Oh, because that's
still zero zero, right?

327
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,000
So that's this
determinant equals

328
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,780
five times this determinant, and
the determinant has to be zero.

329
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,100
I think I didn't do
that the very best way.

330
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,670
You were, yeah, you
had the idea better.

331
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,620
Multiply, yeah,
take T equals zero.

332
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,170
Was that your idea?

333
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,840
Take T equals zero in rule 3B.

334
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,990
If T is zero in rule 3B, and I
bring the camera back to rule

335
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,720
3B --

336
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,260
sorry.

337
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:01,300
If T is zero, then I
have a zero zero there

338
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,330
and the determinant is zero.

339
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:08,710
OK, one way or another, a row of
zeroes means zero determinant.

340
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:14,930
OK, now I have to get serious.

341
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:20,500
The next properties are the
ones that we're building up to.

342
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,750
OK, so I can do elimination.

343
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,540
I can reduce to a
triangular matrix

344
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,120
and now what's the determinant
of that triangular matrix?

345
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,100
OK, so they had to wait
until the last minute.

346
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,280
Suppose, suppose I --
all right, rule seven.

347
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,430
So suppose my matrix
is now triangular.

348
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,660
So it's got --

349
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,870
so I even give these the names
of the pivots, d1, d2, to dn,

350
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:54,710
and stuff is up here, I
don't know what that is,

351
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,970
but what I do know is
this is all zeroes.

352
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:04,750
That's all zeroes, and I would
like to know the determinant,

353
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,370
because elimination
will get me to this.

354
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:11,610
So once I'm here, what's
the determinant then?

355
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:16,560
Let me use an eraser to get
those, get that vertical bar

356
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:22,350
again, so that I'm taking the
determinant of U so that, so,

357
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:28,510
what is the determinant of
an upper triangular matrix?

358
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:33,215
Do you know the answer?

359
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,220
It's just the product
of the d's. for it.

360
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,740
The -- these things that I
don't even put in letters

361
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:53,020
for, because they don't matter,
the determinant is d1 times d2

362
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,197
times dn.

363
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,100
If I have a triangular
matrix, then the diagonal

364
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,770
is all I have to work with.

365
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,550
And that's, that's
telling us then.

366
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:15,120
We now have the way that
MATLAB, any reasonable software,

367
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,250
would compute a determinant.

368
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,990
If I have a matrix
of size a hundred,

369
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,817
the way I would actually
compute its determinant would be

370
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:27,400
elimination, make it triangular,
multiply the pivots together,

371
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,940
but it -- would
it be possible t-

372
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,110
to produce the same matrix
the product of the pivots,

373
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,080
the product of pivots.

374
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,080
Now, there's always in
determinants a plus or minus

375
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,630
and cross every T in that
proof, but that's really

376
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,850
the sign to remember.

377
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:51,840
Where -- where does that
come into this rule?

378
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,500
Could it be, could
the determinant

379
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,210
be minus the product
of the pivots?

380
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,740
The determinant
is d1, d2, to dn.

381
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,380
No doubt about that.

382
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,370
But to get to this
triangular form,

383
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:12,660
we may have had to do a row
exchange, so, so this --

384
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,890
it's the product of the pivots
if there were no row exchanges.

385
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,370
If, if SLU code,
the simple LU code,

386
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,770
the square LU went
right through.

387
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,070
If we had to do
some row exchanges,

388
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,840
then we've got to
watch plus or minus.

389
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,680
OK, but though -- this
law is simply that.

390
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,180
OK, how do I prove that?

391
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:42,730
Let's see, let me suppose
that d's are not zeroes.

392
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,620
The pivots are not zeroes.

393
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:50,550
And tell me, how do I show
that none of this upper stuff

394
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,840
makes any difference?

395
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,550
How do I get zeroes there?

396
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,630
By elimination, right?

397
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,940
I just multiply this
row by the right number,

398
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,950
subtract from that
row, kills that.

399
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:09,030
I multiply this row by the
right number, kills that,

400
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,010
by the right number, kills that.

401
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:15,850
Now, you kill every one of these
off-diagonal terms, no problem

402
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,450
and I'm just left
with the diagonal.

403
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,940
Well, strictly
speaking, I still have

404
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,680
to figure out why is,
for a diagonal matrix

405
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,745
now, why is that the
right determinant?

406
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:37,260
I mean, we sure
hope it is, but why?

407
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,270
I have to go back to
properties one, two, three.

408
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:46,710
Why is -- now that the
matrix is suddenly diagonal,

409
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,950
how do I know that the
determinant is just

410
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,070
a product of That's
my proof, really,

411
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,200
that once I've got
those diagonal entries?

412
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,030
Well, what I going to use?

413
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,760
I'm going to use property
3A, is that right?

414
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,250
I'll factor this,
I'll factor this,

415
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,380
I'll factor that d1 out
and have one and have

416
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,280
the first row will be that.

417
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,710
And then I'll factor out
the d2, shall I shall

418
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,160
I put the d2 here,
and the second row

419
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,110
will look like that, and so on.

420
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,150
So I've factored out all the
d's and what I left with?

421
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,370
The identity.

422
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,970
And what rule do I
finally get to use?

423
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,030
Rule one.

424
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:29,900
Finally, this is the point
where rule one finally chips

425
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,480
in and says that this
determinant is one,

426
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,520
so it's the product of the d's.

427
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,950
So this was rules five,
to do elimination,

428
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:48,680
3A to factor out the D's, and,
and our best friend, rule one.

429
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,240
And possibly rule
two, the exchanges

430
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,710
may have been needed also.

431
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,210
OK.

432
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,350
Now I guess I have to consider
also the case if some d is

433
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:06,680
zero, because I was assuming I
could use the d's to clean out

434
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,490
and make a diagonal,
but what if --

435
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:13,390
what if one of those
diagonal entries is zero?

436
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,380
Well, then with
elimination we know

437
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,440
that we can get a row
of zeroes, and for a row

438
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,200
of zeroes I'm using rule
six, the determinant is zero,

439
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,020
and that's right.

440
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,690
So I can check
the singular case.

441
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:36,250
In fact, I can now get to the
key point that determinant of A

442
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:44,920
is zero, exactly when,
exactly when A is singular.

443
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,880
And otherwise is not singular,
so that the determinant

444
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,800
is a fair test for invertibility
or non-invertibility.

445
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,610
So, I must be close to that
because I can take any matrix

446
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,290
and get there.

447
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,870
Do I -- did I have
anything to say?

448
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:12,970
The, the proofs, it starts
by saying by elimination

449
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,680
go from A to U.

450
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,290
Oh, yeah.

451
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,940
Actually looks to
me like I don't --

452
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,450
haven't said anything brand-new
here, that, that really,

453
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:28,950
I've got this, because
let's just remember the

454
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:37,980
By elimination, I can go from
the original A to reason.

455
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:43,440
Well, OK, now suppose the
matrix is U. singular.

456
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,630
If the matrix is
singular, what happens?

457
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:50,480
Then by elimination
I get a row of zeroes

458
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,240
and therefore the
determinant is zero.

459
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,170
And if the matrix is not
singular, I don't get zero,

460
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,220
so maybe -- do you want me to
put this, like, in two parts?

461
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:10,100
The determinant of A is not
zero when A is invertible.

462
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,750
Because I've already --

463
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:23,240
in chapter two we figured out
when is the matrix invertible.

464
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,770
It's invertible when elimination
produces a full set of pivots

465
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,420
and now, and we now, we know
the determinant is the product

466
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,160
of those non-zero numbers.

467
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,410
So those are the two cases.

468
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,180
If it's singular, I
go to a row of zeroes.

469
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:49,680
If it's invertible, I go to
U and then to the diagonal D,

470
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:57,150
and then which -- and
then to d1, d2, up to dn.

471
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,050
As the formula -- so
we have a formula now.

472
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,110
We have a formula
for the determinant

473
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,520
and it's actually a
very much more practical

474
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,100
formula than the but they didn't
matter anyway. ad-bc formula.

475
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:18,050
Is it correct, maybe you should
just -- let's just check that.

476
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:18,970
Two-by-two.

477
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:23,850
What are the pivots of
a two-by-two matrix?

478
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,270
What does elimination do
with a two-by-two matrix?

479
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,370
It -- there's the
first pivot, fine.

480
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,880
What's the second pivot?

481
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,970
We subtract, so I'm putting it
in this upper triangular form.

482
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:44,270
What do I -- my multiplier
is c over a, right?

483
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,790
I multiply that row
by c over a and I

484
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:50,590
subtract to get that
zero, and here I

485
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,470
have d minus c over a times b.

486
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,870
That's the elimination
on a two-by-two.

487
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:07,440
So I've finally discovered that
the determinant of this matrix

488
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:07,940
--

489
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:12,240
I've got it from the properties,
not by knowing the answer

490
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,830
from last year, that the
determinant of this two-by-two

491
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,730
is the product of A
times that, and of course

492
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,180
when I multiply A by that,
the product of that and that

493
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,485
is ad minus, the a is canceled,

494
00:32:30,485 --> 00:32:30,985
bc.

495
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,320
So that's great,
provided a isn't zero.

496
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,960
because all math professors
watching this will be waiting

497
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,190
If a was zero, that step
wasn't allowed, with seven row

498
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,130
exchanges and with ten row
exchanges? zero wasn't a pivot.

499
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,600
So that's what I --

500
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,850
I've covered all the bases.

501
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:53,090
I have to -- if a is zero,
then I have to do the exchange,

502
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,570
and if the exchange doesn't
work, it's because a is proof.

503
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,730
singular.

504
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:03,130
OK, those are --

505
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,520
those are the direct
properties of the determinant.

506
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:11,120
And now, finally, I've got
two more, nine and ten.

507
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,920
And that's --

508
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,030
I think you can...

509
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:25,210
Like, the ones
we've got here are

510
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,870
totally connected with
our elimination process

511
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:35,340
and whether pivots are
available and whether we

512
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,820
get a row of zeroes.

513
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,360
I think all that you
can swallow in one shot.

514
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,730
Let me tell you
properties nine and ten.

515
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,000
They're quick to write down.

516
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,940
They're very, very useful.

517
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,260
So I'll just write
them down and use them.

518
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:01,410
Property nine says that the
determinant of a product --

519
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:05,610
if I That's the, like,
concrete proof that,

520
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,180
multiply two matrices.

521
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,909
So if I multiply two
matrices, A and B,

522
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:14,050
that the determinant
of the product

523
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:26,730
is determinant of A times
determinant of B, and for me

524
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:31,750
that one is like, that's
a very valuable property,

525
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,449
and it's sort of like partly
coming out of the blue,

526
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:37,050
because we haven't been
multiplying matrices

527
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:41,159
and here suddenly
this determinant

528
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,590
has this multiplying property.

529
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,750
Remember, it didn't have
the linear property,

530
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,810
it didn't have the
adding property.

531
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,389
The determinant
of A plus B is not

532
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:57,210
the sum of the determinants,
but the determinant of A times B

533
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,220
is the product, is the
product of the determinants.

534
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:06,955
OK, so for example, what's
the determinant of A inverse?

535
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,240
Using that property nine.

536
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,230
Let me, let me put
that under here

537
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:27,800
because the camera is happier
if it can focus on both at once.

538
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,140
So let me put it underneath.

539
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:34,510
The determinant of A
inverse, because property ten

540
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:40,420
will come in that space.

541
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,530
What does this tell me about
A inverse, its determinant?

542
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:47,730
OK, well, what do I
know about A inverse?

543
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:54,980
I know that A inverse
times A is odd.

544
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,960
So what I going to do?

545
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,450
I'm going to take
determinants of both sides.

546
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,290
The determinant of
I is one, and what's

547
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:10,390
the determinant of A inverse A?

548
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,670
That's a product of
two matrices, A and B.

549
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,510
So it's the product
of the determinant,

550
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,830
so what I learning?

551
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,840
I'm learning that
the determinant

552
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:24,070
of A inverse times
the determinant of A

553
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:27,800
is the determinant of
I, that's this one.

554
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,870
Again, I happily
use property one.

555
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:35,950
OK, so that tells me that
the determinant of A inverse

556
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,270
is one over.

557
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,000
Here's my -- here's
my conclusion --

558
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:53,910
is one over the
determinant of A.

559
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,810
I guess that that --

560
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,620
I, I always try to think, well,
do we know some cases of that?

561
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,450
Of course, we know it's right
already if A is diagonal.

562
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:09,000
If A is a diagonal matrix,
then its determinant

563
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,480
is just a product
of those numbers.

564
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,890
So if A is, for
example, two-three,

565
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:20,740
then we know that A-inverse
is one-half one-third,

566
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:26,440
and sure enough, that
has determinant six,

567
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,430
and that has
determinant one-sixth.

568
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,360
And our rule checks.

569
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:39,490
So somehow this proof,
this property has to --

570
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,960
somehow the proof
of that property --

571
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,950
if we can boil it down to
diagonal matrices then we can

572
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,140
read it off, whether
it's A and A-inverse,

573
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,660
or two different diagonal
matrices A and B.

574
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,430
For diagonal --
so what I saying?

575
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:59,050
I'm saying for a
diagonal matrices, check.

576
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:02,380
But we'd have to do
elimination steps,

577
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:08,510
we'd have to patiently
do the, the, argument

578
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:11,810
if we want to use these
previous properties to get it

579
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:12,980
for other matrices.

580
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:18,094
And it also tells me -- what,
just let's, see what else

581
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:18,760
it's telling me.

582
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,900
What's the determinant
of, of A-squared?

583
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,750
If I take a matrix
and square it?

584
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:30,460
Then the determinant
just got squared.

585
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,140
Right?

586
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,180
The determinant of
A-squared is the determinant

587
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,864
of A times the determinant of A.

588
00:38:35,864 --> 00:38:38,030
So if I square the matrix,
I square the determinant.

589
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:43,180
If I double the matrix, what do
I do to the non-zeroes flipped

590
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,350
to the other side of the
diagonal, determinant?

591
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,930
Think about that one.

592
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:52,690
If I double the matrix, what
-- so the determinant of A,

593
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,150
since I'm writing down,
like, facts that follow,

594
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:02,500
the determinant of A-squared
is the determinant of A,

595
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,740
all squared.

596
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,580
The determinant of 2A is what?

597
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,380
That's A plus A.

598
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,910
But wait, er, I
don't want the answer

599
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,410
to determinant of A here.

600
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,150
That's wrong.

601
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,860
It's not two determinant
of A, What is it?

602
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,880
OK, one more coming,
which I I have to make,

603
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,190
what's the number that I have
to multiply determinant of A

604
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,900
by if I double the
whole matrix, if I

605
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,710
double every entry
in the matrix?

606
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,220
What happens to the determinant?

607
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,230
If that were possible,
that would be a bad thing,

608
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,640
Supposed it's an n-by-n
matrix. that gets --

609
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,850
get down to triangular

610
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,690
Two to the n, right.

611
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,120
Two to the nth.

612
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,650
Now, why is it two to the
nth, and not just two?

613
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,070
So why is it two to the nth?

614
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,230
Because I'm factoring
out two from every row.

615
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,610
There's a factor -- this has
a factor two in every row,

616
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,640
so I can factor two
out of the first row.

617
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,120
I factor a different two out of
the second row, a different two

618
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,640
out of the nth row, so I've
got all those twos coming out.

619
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,290
So it's like volume,
really, and that's

620
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,570
one of the great
applications of determinants.

621
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:30,860
If I -- if I have a box
and I double all the sides,

622
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:35,800
I multiply the volume
by two to the nth.

623
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,440
If it's a box in
three dimensions,

624
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,970
I multiply the volume by 8.

625
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:47,190
So this is rule 3A here.

626
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,480
This is rule nine.

627
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:55,100
And notice the way this
rule sort of checks out with

628
00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:02,550
the singular/non-singular
stuff, that if A is invertible,

629
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,650
what does that mean
about its determinant?

630
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:08,020
It's not zero, and
therefore this makes sense.

631
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,940
The case when
determinant of A is

632
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:19,870
zero, that's the case where my
formula doesn't work anymore.

633
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:24,030
If determinant of A is
zero, this is ridiculous,

634
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,800
and that's ridiculous.

635
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,300
A-inverse doesn't exist, and one
over zero doesn't make sense.

636
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,090
So don't miss this property.

637
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,560
It's sort of, like,
amazing that it can...

638
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,660
And the tenth property is
equally simple to state,

639
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,720
that the determinant
of A transposed

640
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:57,010
equals the determinant of A.

641
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:03,030
And of course, let's just
check it on the ab cd guy.

642
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:07,075
We could check that sure
enough, that's ab cd, it works.

643
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:14,350
It's ad - bc, it's
ad - bc, sure enough.

644
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:19,140
So that transposing did
not change the determinant.

645
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:24,790
But what it does change is --

646
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:28,400
well, what it does is
it lists, so all --

647
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,340
I've been working with rows.

648
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,690
If a row is all zeroes,
the determinant is zero.

649
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:40,360
But now, with rule
ten, I know what to do

650
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,750
is a column is all zero.

651
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,550
If a column is all zero,
what's the determinant?

652
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,260
Zero, again.

653
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:53,250
So, like all those properties
about rows, exchanging two rows

654
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,080
reverses the sign.

655
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,210
Now, exchanging two
columns reverses

656
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,990
the sign, because
I can always, if I

657
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,690
want to see why,
I can transpose,

658
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:08,680
those columns become rows, I do
the exchange, I transpose back.

659
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,760
And I've done a
column operation.

660
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,530
So, in, in conclusion, there was
nothing special about row one,

661
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,610
'cause I could exchange
rows, and now there's

662
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:25,060
nothing special about rows that
isn't equally true for columns

663
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,980
because this is the same.

664
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,580
OK.

665
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:32,080
And again, maybe I won't --

666
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,320
oh, let's see.

667
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:33,820
Do we...?

668
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,930
Maybe it's worth seeing a
quick proof of this number ten,

669
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:44,620
quick, quick, er,
proof of number ten.

670
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,970
Er, let me take the
-- this is number ten.

671
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:51,380
A transposed equals A.

672
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:56,480
Determinate of A transposed
equals determinate of A.

673
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,110
That's what I should have said.

674
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,280
OK.

675
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:07,820
So, let's just, er.

676
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:11,450
A typical matrix A,
if I use elimination,

677
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:16,100
this factors into LU.

678
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:21,710
And the transpose is U
transpose, l transpose.

679
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,370
Er... let me.

680
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:36,870
So this is proof, this is
proof number ten, using --

681
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,820
well, I don't know which
ones I'll use, so I'll put

682
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,840
'em all in, one to nine.

683
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,650
OK.

684
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:47,400
I'm going to prove number
ten by using one to nine.

685
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,910
I won't cover every case,
but I'll cover almost every

686
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,550
case.

687
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,400
So in almost every case,
A can factor into LU,

688
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,710
and A transposed can
factor into that.

689
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,070
Now, what do I do next?

690
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,910
So I want to prove that
these are the same.

691
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,610
I see a product here.

692
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:09,560
So I use rule nine.

693
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:14,860
So, now what I want to prove is,
so now I know that this is LU,

694
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:19,810
this is U transposed
and l transposed.

695
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:24,010
Now, just for a practice, what
are all those determinants?

696
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:28,710
So this is, this is, this is
prove this, prove this, prove

697
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,460
this, and now I'm
ready to do it.

698
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,460
What's the determinant of l?

699
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:40,240
You remember what l is, it's
this lower triangular matrix

700
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,085
with ones on the diagonals.

701
00:45:43,085 --> 00:45:44,710
So what is the
determinant of that guy?

702
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,210
I- It's one.

703
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,000
Any time I have this
triangular matrix,

704
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:00,390
I can get rid of
all the non-zeroes,

705
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:07,920
down to the diagonal case.

706
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,750
The determinate of l is one.

707
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:21,810
How about the determinant
of l transposed?

708
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,410
That's triangular also, right?

709
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,050
Still got those ones
on the diagonal,

710
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:59,050
it's just the matrices and then
get down to diagonal matrices.

711
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,600
right?

712
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:09,290
If If I could --
why would it be bad?

713
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,800
My whole lecture
would die, right?

714
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:37,360
Because rule two said that if
you do seven row exchanges,

715
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:47,700
then the sign of the
determinant reverses.

716
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:56,820
But if you do ten row exchanges,
the sign of the determinant

717
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:02,520
stays the same, because minus
one ten times is plus one.

718
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:16,630
OK, so there's a hidden
fact here, that every --

719
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:19,150
like, every permutation,
the permutations

720
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:23,310
are either odd or even.

721
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:26,360
I could get the permutation
with seven row exchanges,

722
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,770
then I could
probably get it with

723
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:31,430
twenty-one, or twenty-three,
or a hundred and one,

724
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:33,430
if it's an odd one.

725
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:35,980
Or an even number
of permutations, so,

726
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,070
but that's the key
fact that just takes

727
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:43,760
another little
algebraic trick to see,

728
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,947
and that means that the
determinant is well-defined

729
00:48:45,947 --> 00:48:47,530
by properties one,
two, three and it's

730
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:47,580
got properties four to ten.

731
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:47,660
OK, that's today
and I'll try to get

732
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:47,890
the homework for next Wednesday
onto the web this afternoon.

733
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,440
Thanks.
