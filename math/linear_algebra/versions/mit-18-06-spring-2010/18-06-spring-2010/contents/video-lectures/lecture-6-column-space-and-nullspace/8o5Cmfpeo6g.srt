1
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:09,660
Okay.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,950
This is lecture six
in linear algebra,

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,790
and we're at the start of this
new chapter, chapter three

4
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,500
in the text, which
is really getting

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,930
to the center of linear algebra.

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,460
And I had time to make
a first start on it

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,690
at the end of lecture five.

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,430
But now is lecture
six is officially

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,610
the lecture on vector
spaces and subspaces.

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,070
And then especially --
there are two subspaces that

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,840
we're specially interested in.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,680
One is the column
space of a matrix,

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,630
the other is the null
space of the matrix.

14
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,050
So, I got to tell
you what those are.

15
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,140
Okay.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,140
So, first to remember
from lecture five,

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,350
what is a vector space?

18
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,410
It's a bunch of vectors
that -- where I'm allowed --

19
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,970
where I can add --

20
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,690
I can add any two
vectors in the space

21
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,300
and the answer
stays in the space.

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,610
Or I can multiply any vector
in the space by any constant

23
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,870
and the result
stays in the space.

24
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,950
So that's -- in fact if I
combine those two into one,

25
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,710
you can see that -- if I can add
and I can multiply by numbers,

26
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,750
that really means that I can
take linear combinations.

27
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,220
So the quick way to say it is
that all linear combinations,

28
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,250
C -- any multiple of V
plus any multiple of W stay

29
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,220
in the space.

30
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,070
So, can I give you examples
that are vector spaces and also

31
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,850
some examples that are not,
to make that point clear?

32
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,220
So, suppose I'm in
three dimensions.

33
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:16,950
Then one way to get us one space
is the whole three dimensional

34
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,200
space.

35
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,770
So the whole space R^3,
three dimensional space,

36
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,100
would be a vector space, because
if I have a couple of vectors I

37
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,040
can add them and I'm certainly
okay and they follow all

38
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,240
the rules.

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,600
So R^3 is easy.

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,320
Now I'm interested
also in subspaces.

41
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,370
So there's this key
word, subspaces.

42
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:48,530
That's a space -- that's some
vectors inside the given space,

43
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,940
inside R three that still make
up a vector space of their own.

44
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,990
It's a vector space
inside a vector space.

45
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,030
And the simplest
example was a plane.

46
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,070
So, like, can I just sketch
it -- there is a plane.

47
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,280
It's got to go
through the origin,

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,390
and of course it
goes infinitely far.

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,620
That's of that's a subspace now.

50
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,190
Do you see that if I have
two vectors on the plane

51
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,920
and I add them, the
result stays in the plane.

52
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,770
If I take a vector in the plane
and I multiply by minus two,

53
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,520
I'm still in the plane.

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,240
So that plane is a subspace.

55
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,120
So let me just make that point.

56
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Plane through zero, through that
zero zero zero is a subspace.

57
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,060
Okay.

58
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,710
And also, another
subspace would be a line.

59
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,230
A line through zero
zero zero -- yeah,

60
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,240
the line has to go
through the origin.

61
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,390
All subspaces have got
to contain the origin,

62
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,910
contain zero -- the zero vector.

63
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,015
So this line is a subspace.

64
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,910
Really, if I want to
say it really correctly,

65
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,899
I should say a subspace of R^3.

66
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,710
That of R^3 was, like,
understood there.

67
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:30,730
Now -- so let me call this plane
P. And let me call this line L.

68
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:40,540
And let me ask you about
other sets of vectors.

69
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,210
Suppose I took --

70
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,310
yeah -- so here's
a first question.

71
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,030
Suppose I take two
subspaces, like P and L.

72
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,610
And I just put them
together, take their union,

73
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,890
take all the vectors --

74
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,880
so now you've got P
and L in mind, here.

75
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,870
So I have two subspaces.

76
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:09,960
I have two subspaces
and, for example, P --

77
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,070
a plane and L a line.

78
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,410
Okay.

79
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,970
Now I want to ask you
about the union of those.

80
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,190
So P union L.

81
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:29,990
This is all vectors
in P or L or both.

82
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,240
Is that a subspace?

83
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,040
Is this a subspace?

84
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:48,380
This is or is not a subspace?

85
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,690
Because we're -- I just want
to be sure that I've got

86
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,340
the central idea.

87
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,200
Suppose I take the
vectors in the plane

88
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,230
and also the vectors
on that line,

89
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,930
put them together, so I've
got a bunch of vectors,

90
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,030
is it a subspace?

91
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,210
Can you give me,
like, so the camera

92
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,700
can hear it or maybe the tape.

93
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,650
Can you say yes or no?

94
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:20,770
Do I have a subspace if I put
-- if I take all the vectors

95
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,660
on the plane plus all -- and all
the ones on the line and just

96
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,520
join them together -- but I'm
not taking this guy that's --

97
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,240
actually, I'm not
taking most of them,

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,680
because most vectors are not
on the line or the plane,

99
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,590
they're off somewhere else.

100
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,970
Do I have a subspace?

101
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,697
STUDENTS: No.

102
00:06:40,697 --> 00:06:41,280
STRANG: Right.

103
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,790
Thank you.

104
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,510
No.

105
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,980
Because -- why not?

106
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,130
Because I can't add.

107
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,090
Because if I that
requirement isn't satisfied.

108
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,050
If I take one vector like
this guy and another vector

109
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,100
that happens to come from L and
add, I'm off somewhere else.

110
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:06,870
You see that I've gone outside
the union if I just add

111
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,070
something from P and
something from L,

112
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:15,550
then normally what'll happen
is I'm outside the union --

113
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,770
and I don't have a subspace.

114
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,120
So the correct answer is --

115
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,270
is not.

116
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,850
Okay.

117
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,630
Now let me ask you about --
the other thing we do is take

118
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,240
the intersection.

119
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,410
So what does intersection mean?

120
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:43,830
Intersection means all vectors
that are in both P and L.

121
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,970
Is this a subspace.

122
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,730
Yeah, so I guess I want to go
back up to the same question.

123
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,360
This is or is not a subspace?

124
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,910
And you can answer me -- answer
the question first for this

125
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,640
particular example,
this picture I drew.

126
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,780
What is P intersect
L for this case?

127
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,280
STUDENT: It's only zero.

128
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,810
STRANG: It's only zero.

129
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,240
At least, sort of this was the
artist's idea as he drew it

130
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,250
that, that that line L was
not in the plane and, went off

131
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,120
somewhere else -- and then the
only point that was in common

132
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,770
was the zero vector.

133
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,430
Is the zero vector
by itself a subspace?

134
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,000
STUDENT: Yes.

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,740
STRANG: Yes, absolutely.

136
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:34,049
And what about, if I don't
have this plane and this line

137
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:38,789
but any subspace and
any other subspace?

138
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,740
So now -- can I ask that
question for any two subspaces?

139
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,800
So maybe I'll write it up here.

140
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,240
If I'm strong enough.

141
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,510
So this is the general question.

143
00:08:52,510 --> 00:09:00,350
I have subspaces, say S and T.

144
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:08,640
And I want to ask you about
their intersection S intersect

145
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,300
T and I want --

146
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,220
it is a subspace.

147
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,430
Do you see why?

148
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,610
Do you see why if I take the
vectors that are in both one-

149
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,930
th- that are in both
of the subspaces --

150
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,490
so that's like a smaller
set of vectors, probably,

151
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,540
because it's -- we've
added requirements.

152
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,370
It has to be in S and in T.

153
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,100
How do I know that's a subspace?

154
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,560
Can we just think through
that abstract stuff

155
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,640
and then I get to the examples.

156
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,870
Okay.

157
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,940
So why?

158
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,490
Suppose I take a
couple of vectors

159
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,040
that are in the intersection.

160
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,500
Why is the sum also
in the intersection?

161
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,900
Okay, so let me give a name
to these vectors, say V and W.

162
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,280
They're in the intersection.

163
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,310
So that means they're both in S.

164
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,370
Also means they're both in T.

165
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,960
So what can I say
about V plus W?

166
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,350
Is it in S?

167
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,040
Yes.

168
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,480
Right?

169
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,300
If I take two vectors, V
and W that are both in S,

170
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,900
then the sum is in S,
because S was a subspace.

171
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,830
And if they're both
in T and I add them,

172
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,990
then the result is also in
T, because T was a subspace.

173
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,100
So the result V plus W
is in the intersection.

174
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,690
It's in both and requirement
one is satisfied.

175
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,480
Requirement two's the same.

176
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,080
If I take a vector that's in
both, I multiply by seven.

177
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,470
Seven times that vector is in
S, because the vector was in S.

178
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,290
Seven times that vector's in T
because the original one was in

179
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,080
T. So seven times that vector
is in the intersection.

180
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,740
In other words, when you
take the intersection of two

181
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,830
subspaces, you get probably
a smaller subspace,

182
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,440
but it is a subspace.

183
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,780
Okay.

184
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:17,270
So that's like sort of
just emphasizing what

185
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,080
these two requirements mean.

186
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,700
Again -- Let me circle those,
because those are so important.

187
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:30,490
The sum and the scale of
multiplication which combines

188
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,850
into linear combinations.

189
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,130
That's what you have to
do inside the subspace.

190
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:37,980
Okay.

191
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,530
On to the column space.

192
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,030
Okay.

193
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,690
So my lecture last time started
that and I want to continue it.

194
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,190
Okay.

195
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,680
Column space of a matrix.

196
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,190
Of A.

197
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,060
Okay.

198
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,240
Can I take an example?

199
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,030
Say one two three four.

200
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,410
One one one one.

201
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,570
Two three four five.

202
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,370
Okay.

203
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:19,610
That's my matrix A.

204
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:25,900
So, it's got columns,
three columns.

205
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,700
Those columns are vectors, so
the column space of this A,

206
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
of this A --

207
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,970
let's stay with this
example for a while.

208
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:40,520
The column space of this
matrix is a subspace of R --

209
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,600
R what?

210
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,990
So what space are
we in if I'm looking

211
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,730
at the columns of this matrix?

212
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,770
R^4 , right?

213
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,680
These are vectors in R^4,
they're four dimensional

214
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,800
vectors.

215
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:04,010
So it's this column space of
A is a subspace of R^4 here,

216
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,030
because A was four by --

217
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,190
A is a four by three matrix.

218
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,080
This tells me how
many rows there are,

219
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,020
how many components in a
column, and so we're in R^4.

220
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,030
Okay, now what's
in that subspace?

221
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,300
So the column space of A,
it's a subspace of R^4.

222
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,790
I call it the column
space of A, like that.

223
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:34,670
So that's my little symbol
for some subspace of R^4.

224
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,480
What's in that subspace?

225
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,010
Well, that column certainly is.

226
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,350
One two three four.

227
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,460
This column is in.

228
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,750
This column is
in, and what else?

229
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,480
So it's got the
columns of A in it,

230
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,671
but that's not
enough, certainly.

231
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:52,170
Right?

232
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,700
I don't have a subspace if
I just put in three vectors.

233
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,210
So how do I fill that
out to be a subspace?

234
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:06,000
I take their linear
combinations.

235
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:15,110
So the column space of A is
all linear combinations --

236
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,710
combinations of the columns.

237
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,890
And that does give
me a subspace.

238
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,890
It does give me a vector
space, because if I

239
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,040
have one linear combination
and I multiply by eleven,

240
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,680
I've got another
linear combination.

241
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,190
If I have a linear
combination, I

242
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,730
add to another
linear combination

243
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,970
I get a third combination.

244
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,260
So that -- this is like
the smallest space --

245
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,040
like, it's got to have
those three columns in it,

246
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,270
and it has to have
their combinations

247
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,110
and that's where we stop.

248
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,680
Okay.

249
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,120
Now I'm going to be
interested in that space.

250
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,930
So I, like -- get some idea
of what's in that space.

251
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,450
How big is that space?

252
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,880
Is that space the whole
four dimensional space?

253
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,290
Or is it a subspace inside?

254
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:13,870
Can you -- let me just see if
we can get a yes or no answer

255
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:19,930
sometimes without being
ready for the complete proof.

256
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,540
What do you think?

257
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,590
Is the subspace that
I'm talking about here,

258
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,700
the combinations of
those three guys,

259
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,250
does that fill the full
four dimensional space?

260
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,900
Maybe yes or no on that one.

261
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,560
No.

262
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,060
No.

263
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,640
Somehow our feeling
is, and it happens

264
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,730
to be right, that if we
start with three vectors

265
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,660
and take their combinations,
we can't get the whole four

266
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,680
dimensional space.

267
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,590
Now -- so somehow we
get a smaller space.

268
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,010
But how much smaller?

269
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,280
That's going to come up here.

270
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,970
That's not so immediate.

271
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:07,950
Let me first make this
critical connection with --

272
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:15,980
with, linear equations, because
behind our abstract definition,

273
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,360
we have a purpose.

274
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,750
And that is to understand Ax=b.

275
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,950
So suppose I make
the connection --

276
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:33,330
w- w- does A x=b always
have a solution for every b?

277
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:47,850
Have a solution for
every right-hand side?

278
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,880
I guess that's going to
be a yes or no question.

279
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:59,580
And then I'm going to ask which
right-hand sides are okay?

280
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,050
That's really the
question I'm after,

281
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:08,900
is which right-hand
sides (b) do make up --

282
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,210
you can see from the way I'm
speaking what the question --

283
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,839
As it is.

284
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,020
The answer is no.

285
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,710
A x=b does not have a
solution for every b.

286
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:26,069
Why do I say no?

287
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:34,660
Because A x=b is -- like,
this is four equations,

288
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,940
and only three unknowns.

289
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,860
Right?

290
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:46,057
X is -- let me right
out that whole --

291
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:47,390
what the whole thing looks like.

292
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,600
Yeah.

293
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,680
Let me write out A x=b.

294
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,310
A x is --

295
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,260
these columns are
one two three four.

296
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,050
One one one one and
two three four five.

297
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:12,410
Then x, of course, has three
components, x1, x2, x3.

298
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,610
And I'm trying to get the --

299
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,257
hit the right-hand
side, b1,b2,b3 and b4.

300
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,850
So my first point is,
I can't always do it.

301
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,140
In a way, that just says again
what you told me five minutes

302
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,220
ago --

303
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,540
that the combinations
of these columns

304
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,630
don't fill the whole
four dimensional space.

305
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,190
There's going to be some
vectors b, a lot of vectors b,

306
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,530
that are not combinations
of these three columns,

307
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,200
because the combinations
of those columns are, like,

308
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,130
going to be just a little
plane or something inside --

309
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,050
inside R^4.

310
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:03,990
Now, so and you see that I do
have four equations and only

311
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,210
three unknowns.

312
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,110
So, like anybody is going
to say, no you dope,

313
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,650
you can't usually
solve four equations

314
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,330
with only three unknowns.

315
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,710
But now I want to say
sometimes you can.

316
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,330
For some right-hand
sides, I can solve this.

317
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,900
So that's the bunch
of right-hand sides

318
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,710
that I'm interested
in right now.

319
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:34,860
Which right-hand sides
allow me to solve this?

320
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,740
This is the question for today.

321
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,240
It's going to have, like,
a nice clear answer.

322
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:50,800
So my question is -- is
which bs, which vectors b,

323
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,200
allow this system to be solved?

324
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,150
And I want to ask you --

325
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,090
so that's, like, gets two
question marks to indicate

326
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,350
that's -- this is the
important question.

327
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:15,030
Okay, first, before we
give a total answer,

328
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,000
give me just a partial answer.

329
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,910
Tell me one right-hand
side that I know

330
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,160
I can solve this thing for.

331
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,910
So -- all zeroes.

332
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:25,410
Okay.

333
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,000
That's the, like, guaranteed.

334
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,990
If these were all zero,
then I know I can solve it,

335
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,550
let the x-s all be
zero, no problem.

336
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,890
So that's always a -- okay.

337
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,660
Okay.

338
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,460
A x=0 I can always solve.

339
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,040
Now tell me another
right-hand side,

340
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:52,740
just a specific set of numbers
for which I can solve these

341
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,700
three -- these four equations
with only three unknowns,

342
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,130
but if you give me a good
right-hand side, I can do it.

343
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:00,842
So tell me one?

344
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,550
STUDENT: 1 2 3 4.

345
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,740
STRANG: 1 2 3 4?

346
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,575
If I -- can I solve -- is
that a good right-hand side?

347
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,340
Can you solve -- can you
find a solution that --

348
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,630
X one plus X two plus
two X three is one,

349
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,630
two X one plus X two plus three
X three is two and two more

350
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,858
equations --

351
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,220
so I'm asking you to
solve in your head in --

352
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,750
within five seconds, four
equations and three unknowns,

353
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:41,310
but you can do it, because
the right-hand side is, like,

354
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,610
showing up here is --
it's one of the columns.

355
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,330
So tell me what's the
X that does solve it?

356
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,140
One zero zero.

357
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,960
One zero zero solves
it, because --

358
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,450
well, so you can multiply
this out by rows, but oh God,

359
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,360
it's much nicer to say -- okay,
this is one of this column,

360
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,190
zero of this, zero of this,
so it's one of that column,

361
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,730
which is exactly what we wanted.

362
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,290
Okay.

363
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,280
So there is a b that's okay.

364
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,250
Now tell me another
B that's okay,

365
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,030
another right-hand side
that would be all right?

366
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,055
Well -- all ones?

367
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,450
Actually -- and then what's
the solution in that case?

368
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,080
0 1 0, thanks.

369
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,190
And, in fact, it's
much e- like, one way

370
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:44,230
to do it is think of a
solution first, right,

371
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:50,380
and then just see what
b turns out to be.

372
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,030
What b turns out to be, right.

373
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,790
Okay.

374
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,220
So I think of a solution
-- so I think of an x,

375
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,380
I think of any --

376
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,810
x1, x2, x3, I do
this multiplication

377
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,980
and what have I got?

378
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,920
Now I'm ready to answer
the big question.

379
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,830
I can solve A x=b exactly
when the right-hand side B is

380
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,920
a vector in the column space.

381
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,900
Good.

382
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:33,140
I can solve A x=b when b is
a combination of the columns,

383
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,130
when it's in the column space --

384
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,730
so let me write
that answer down.

385
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:57,910
I can solve Ax=b exactly when
B is in the column space.

386
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:02,210
Let me just say
again why that is.

387
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:07,030
Because it -- the column space
by its definition contains all

388
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:07,870
the combinations.

389
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,710
It contains all the Ax-s.

390
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:17,360
The column space really consists
of all vectors A times any X.

391
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,900
So those are the bs
that I can deal with.

392
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,130
If b is a combination
of the columns,

393
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:32,080
then that combination
tells me what X should be.

394
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,630
If b is not a combination of
the columns, then there is no x.

395
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,650
There's no way to
solve A x equal b.

396
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,420
Okay.

397
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,700
So the column space --

398
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,510
that's really why we're
interested in this column

399
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,170
space, because it's
the central guy.

400
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:56,390
It says when we can
solve, and that --

401
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,880
we got to understand
this column space better.

402
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,000
Let's see.

403
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,260
Do I want to think --

404
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,600
yeah, somehow -- oh,
well, let's just --

405
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,360
as long as we've got it
here, what do I get for this

406
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,550
particular example?

407
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:24,670
If I take combinations of
this and this and this,

408
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,230
I'll tell you the question
that's in my mind.

409
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,930
It's not even proper
to use this word yet,

410
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,280
but you'll know what it means.

411
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,060
Are those three
columns independent?

412
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:44,370
If I take the combinations
of the three columns --

413
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:50,550
does each column contribute
something new or now?

414
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,360
So that if I take the
combinations of those three

415
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,160
columns, do I, like, get some
three dimensional subspace --

416
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,630
do I have three vectors
that are, like, you know,

417
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:07,440
independent,
whatever that means?

418
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,080
Or do I -- is one of
those columns, like,

419
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,370
contributing nothing new --

420
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,630
So that actually only
two of the columns

421
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,040
would have given the
same column space?

422
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,080
Yeah -- that's a good
way to ask the question.

423
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,550
Finally I think of it.

424
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,340
Can I throw away any columns --

425
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,339
and have the same column space?

426
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:27,880
STUDENT: Yes.

427
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,100
STRANG: Yes.

428
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,290
And which one do you
suggest I throw away?

429
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,670
STUDENT: Column three -- three.

430
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:37,350
STRANG: Well, three is the
natural, like, guy to target.

431
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,490
So if I -- and why?

432
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:44,750
Because -- what's so
bad about three here?

433
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,240
Column three?

434
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,310
It's the sum of these, right?

435
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:52,370
So it's not -- if I'm taking --
if I have combinations of these

436
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,510
two and I put in
this one, actually,

437
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,780
I don't get anything more.

438
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:02,460
So later on I will call
these pivot columns.

439
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,780
And the third guy will not
be a pivot column in this --

440
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,760
with those numbers.

441
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,940
Now actually -- honesty makes
me ask you this question.

442
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,350
Could I have thrown
away column one?

443
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,940
Yes, I could.

444
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,920
I could.

445
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,910
So when I say pivot
columns, my convention

446
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,710
is, okay, I'll keep the first
ones as long as they're not

447
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,590
dependent.

448
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,930
So I keep this guy,
he's fine, he's a line.

449
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,100
I keep the second guy.

450
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,810
It's in a second direction.

451
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:39,220
But the third one, which is in
the same plane as the first two

452
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,790
gives me nothing new.

453
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:44,560
It's dependent in the
language that we will use

454
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,990
and I don't need it.

455
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,160
Okay.

456
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,570
So I would describe the column
space of this matrix as a two

457
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,040
dimensional subspace of R^4.

458
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,070
A two dimensional
subspace of R^4.

459
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,990
Okay.

460
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,430
So you're seeing how these
vector spaces work and you --

461
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,760
you're seeing that we --
some idea of dependence

462
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,780
or independence
is in our future.

463
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,400
Okay.

464
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,590
Now I want to speak
about another vector

465
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,460
space, the null space.

466
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,890
So again I'm getting
a little ahead

467
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:28,191
because it's in section three
point two, but that's okay.

468
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:28,690
All right.

469
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,870
Now I'm ready for
the null space.

470
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,340
Let me keep the same matrix.

471
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,370
And this is going
to be a different --

472
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,500
totally different subspace.

473
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,270
Totally different.

474
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,930
Okay.

475
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,370
Now -- so let me
make space for it.

476
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:50,190
Now -- here comes a
completely different subspace,

477
00:28:50,190 --> 00:29:00,120
the null space of A.

478
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,935
What's in it?

479
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,070
It contains not
right-hand sides b.

480
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,750
It contains x-s.

481
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,570
It contains all
x-s that solve --

482
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,040
this word null is going to --

483
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,580
I mean, that's the key
word here, meaning zero.

484
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:30,670
So this contains --
this is all solutions x,

485
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:36,450
and of course x is our
vectors, x1, x2 and x3,

486
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,220
to the equation A x=0.

487
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Well, four equations,
because we've got --

488
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,230
so, do you see what I'm doing?

489
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,890
I'm now saying, okay,
columns were great,

490
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,010
the column space we understood.

491
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,260
Now I'm interested in x-s.

492
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,860
I'm not -- the only b I'm
interested in now is the b

493
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,670
of all zeroes.

494
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,300
The right-hand
side is now zeroes.

495
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,550
And I'm interested in solutions.

496
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,810
x-s.

497
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:18,740
So t- where is this null
space for this example?

498
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,600
These x-s are -- have
three components.

499
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,310
So the null space
is a subspace --

500
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:31,390
we still have to show it
is a subspace -- of R^3.

501
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:35,590
So this is -- and
we will show --

502
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:46,220
these vectors x, this is in
R^3, where the column space was

503
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,910
in R^4 in our example.

504
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:58,340
For an m by n matrix,
this is m and this is n,

505
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,570
because the number
of columns, n,

506
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,000
tells me how many
unknowns, how many x-s

507
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,950
multiply those
columns, so it tells me

508
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:10,480
the big space, in this
case R three that I'm in.

509
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,300
Now tell me -- why don't we
figure out what the null space

510
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:20,310
is for this example,
just by looking at it.

511
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:24,740
I mean, that's the
beauty of small examples,

512
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:30,500
that my official way to find
null spaces and column spaces

513
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:36,200
and get all the facts
straight would be elimination,

514
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,340
and we'll do that.

515
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,120
But with a small example,
we can see that --

516
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,150
see what's going on without
going through the mechanics

517
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,950
of elimination.

518
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,670
So this null space --

519
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,540
so I'm talking about --
again, the null space,

520
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,520
and let me copy
again the matrix.

521
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:04,190
One two three four, one one one
one and two three four five.

522
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,330
What's in the null space?

523
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:11,410
So I'm taking A times x,
so let me right it again,

524
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:16,015
and I want you to solve
those four equations.

525
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,490
In fact, I want you
to find all solutions

526
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,350
to those four equations.

527
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,870
Well, actually, just
first of all find one.

528
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,420
Why should I ask
you for all of them?

529
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,020
Tell me one -- well, tell
me one solution that y-

530
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,660
you don't even have to look at
the matrix to know one solution

531
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,030
to this set of equations.

532
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,430
It is zero vector.

533
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:46,810
Whatever that matrix is, its
null space contains zero --

534
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:51,020
because A times the zero vector
sure gives the zero right-hand

535
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,660
side.

536
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,700
So the null space
certainly contains zero.

537
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,220
A- so it's got a chance
to be a vector space now,

538
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,200
and it will turn out it is.

539
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,880
Okay.

540
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,180
Tell me another solution.

541
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,800
So this particular null space --
and of course I'm going to call

542
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,110
it N(A) for null space --

543
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:17,160
this contains-- well we've
already located the zero

544
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,970
vector, and now you're going
to tell me another vector

545
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,550
that's in the null space,
another solution, another x,

546
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,340
another --

547
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,140
you see what I'm
asking you for is

548
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,950
a combination of those columns.

549
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:33,150
That's what I'm always looking
at combinations of columns,

550
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:40,800
but now I'm looking at the
weights, the coefficients

551
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,710
in the combination.

552
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:46,620
So tell me a good set of
numbers to put in there.

553
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,420
One one -- STUDENTS: Minus one.

554
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,530
STRANG: One one minus one.

555
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,340
Thanks.

556
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,280
One one minus one.

557
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,730
So there's a vector
that's in it.

558
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,250
Okay.

559
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,600
But have I got a
subspace at this point?

560
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,690
Certainly not, right?

561
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,850
I've got just a
couple of vectors.

562
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,860
No way they make a subspace.

563
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,940
Tell me -- actually, why don't
I jump the whole way now?

564
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,840
Tell me -- well, tell
me one more solution,

565
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,460
one more X that would work.

566
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,199
Student: 2 2 -2.

567
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,520
STRANG: 2 2 -2?

568
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,750
Oh, well, tell me all of them,
that would have been easier.

569
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,370
Tell me the whole lot, now.

570
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:34,389
What is the null
space for this matrix?

571
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:38,670
It's all vectors of the
form -- what could this be?

572
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:44,900
It could be one one minus one,
it could be it could be any

573
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:50,880
number C, any number -- the
same number again and --

574
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,010
STUDENTS: Minus.

575
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,420
STRANG: Minus C.

576
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,010
In other words --

577
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,910
actually, any
multiple of this guy.

578
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,270
Oh, that's the
perfect description,

579
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:08,050
because now the zero vector's
automatically included

580
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,040
because C could be zero.

581
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,810
The vector I had is included,
because C could be one.

582
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,750
But now any vector.

583
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,860
And that's actually it.

584
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,450
And do I have a subspace?

585
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,060
And what does it look like?

586
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,620
It's in -- how would you
describe this, the null space,

587
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:35,810
this -- all these vectors of
this form C C minus C, like,

588
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,730
seven seven minus seven.

589
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,080
Minus eleven minus
eleven plus eleven.

590
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,810
What have I got here?

591
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,120
If -- describe that whole
null space of -- what --

592
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,550
if I drew it, what do I draw?

593
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,840
A line, right?

594
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,350
The null space is a line.

595
00:35:53,350 --> 00:36:02,724
It's the line through -- in R^3
and the vector one one negative

596
00:36:02,724 --> 00:36:05,140
one maybe goes down here, I
don't know where it goes, say,

597
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,530
down here.

598
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:12,660
There's the vector one one
negative one that you gave me.

599
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,610
And where is the
vector C C negative C?

600
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,050
It's on this line.

601
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,800
Of course, there's zero
zero zero that we had.

602
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,720
And what we've got is that whole
-- oops -- that whole line,

603
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,640
going both ways,
through the origin.

604
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,030
The null space is a line in R^3.

605
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,930
Okay.

606
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:43,040
For that example, we could
find all the combinations

607
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,590
of the columns that
gave zero at sight.

608
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:51,600
Now, can I just
take one more time,

609
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:57,860
to go back to the definition
of subspace, vector space,

610
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,060
and ask you --

611
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,400
how do I know that the null
space is a vector space?

612
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,610
How I entitled to
use this word space?

613
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:13,070
I'll never use that word space
without meaning that the two

614
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,800
requirements are satisfied.

615
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,250
Can we just check that they are?

616
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,810
So I'm going to check that --

617
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,660
can I just continue here?

618
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:39,240
Check that -- that the
solutions to A x=0 always give

619
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,740
a subspace.

620
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,700
And, of course, the key
word is that= "Space."

621
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,840
So what do I have to check?

622
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:57,340
I have to show that if I
have one solution, call it x,

623
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,240
and another
solution, call it x*,

624
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,970
that their sum is also
a solution, right?

625
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,290
That's a requirement.

626
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:10,010
To use that word
space, I have to say --

627
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:18,650
I have to convince myself that
if A x is zero and also --

628
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:25,140
and A x* is zero, or maybe I
should have said if A v is zero

629
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:30,130
and A w is zero, then
what about v plus w?

630
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,630
Shall I -- let me
use those letters.

631
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:47,300
If A v is zero and A w is zero,
then what -- if that and that,

632
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,240
then what's my point here?

633
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:55,170
That A times (v+w) must be zero.

634
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:59,590
That says that if v is in the
null space and w's in the null

635
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,680
space, then their sum
v+w is in the null space.

636
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,250
And of course, now that
I've written it down,

637
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:11,460
it's totally absurd,
ridiculously simple --

638
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:17,290
because matrix multiplication
allows me to separate that out

639
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,460
into A v plus A w.

640
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,560
I shouldn't say absurdly simple.

641
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,840
That was a dumb thing to say.

642
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,960
Could -- we've used, here,
a basic law of matrix

643
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,580
multiplication.

644
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,070
Actually, we've used it without
proving it, but that's okay.

645
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:39,340
We only live so long,
we just skip that proof.

646
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,820
I think it's called the
distributive law that I can

647
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,770
split these -- split
this into two pieces.

648
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:52,150
But now you see the point, that
A v is zero and A w is zero

649
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,520
so I have zero plus
zero and I do get zero.

650
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,430
It checks.

651
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:02,070
And, similarly, I have to
show that if A v is zero,

652
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:10,130
then A times any multiple,
say 12v is also zero.

653
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,590
And how do I know that?

654
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,900
Because I'm allowed to s-
bring that twelve outside.

655
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:20,640
A number, a scaler can move
outside, so I have twelve A vs,

656
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,740
twelve zeroes --

657
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,960
I have zero.

658
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,550
Okay.

659
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:33,070
Just to -- it's really
critical to understand the --

660
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,390
oh yeah.

661
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,220
Here -- I was going to say,
understand what's the point

662
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,470
of a vector space?

663
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:44,790
Let me make that point by
changing the right-hand side.

664
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,920
Oops.

665
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,420
Okay.

666
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,740
Let me change the right-hand
side to one two three four.

667
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,632
Oh, okay.

668
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:53,840
Why don't we do all of linear
algebra in one lecture,

669
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,890
then we --

670
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:55,900
okay.

671
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,500
I would like to know the
solutions to this equation.

672
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,670
For those four equations.

673
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,660
So I have four equations.

674
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,039
I have only three
unknowns, so if I

675
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:10,830
don't have a pretty
special right-hand side

676
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,640
there won't be any
solution at all.

677
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,070
But that is a very
special right-hand side.

678
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:21,450
And we know that there is
a solution, one zero zero.

679
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,730
Were there any more solutions?

680
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:27,320
And did they form
a vector space?

681
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,600
Okay.

682
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,550
So I'm asking two
questions there.

683
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,530
One is, do -- so my right-hand
side now is not zero anymore.

684
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,100
I'm not looking
at the null space

685
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,070
because I changed from zeroes.

686
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:45,930
So my first question is, do
the solutions, if there are any

687
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:50,610
and there are, do
they form a subspace?

688
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,270
Let's answer that
question first.

689
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,210
Yes or no.

690
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:59,640
Do I get a subspace if I
look at the solutions to --

691
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,300
let me go back to x1 x2 x3.

692
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:08,910
I'm looking at all the x-s, at
all those vectors in R^3 that

693
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,380
solve A x -b.

694
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,400
The only thing I've changed
is b isn't zero anymore.

695
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,045
Do the x-s, the solutions,
form a vector space?

696
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:32,670
The solutions to this
do not form a subspace.

697
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,150
The solutions don't, because --

698
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,460
how shall I see that?

699
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,950
The zero vector is not a
solution, so I never even got

700
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:43,700
started.

701
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,090
The zero vector doesn't
solve this system.

702
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:51,940
I can't -- solutions
can't be a vector space.

703
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,480
Now what are they like?

704
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,810
Well, we'll see this, but
let's do it for this example.

705
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:02,200
So one zero zero was a solution.

706
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,690
You saw that right away.

707
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,310
Are there any other solutions?

708
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:08,730
Can you tell me
a second solution

709
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,430
to this system of equations?

710
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:14,970
STUDENTS: 0 -1 1 STRANG: 0 -1 1.

711
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:19,560
Boy, that's -- 0 -1 1.

712
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,680
Yes.

713
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,090
Because that says I take minus
this column plus this one

714
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:24,790
and sure enough.

715
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,730
That's right.

716
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,750
So there are -- there's a
bunch of solutions here.

717
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,300
But they're not a subspace.

718
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,540
I'll tell you what it's like.

719
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,460
It's like a plane that
doesn't go through the origin,

720
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,930
or a line that doesn't
go through the origin.

721
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,870
Maybe in this case
it's a line that

722
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,870
doesn't go through
the origin, if I graft

723
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,570
the solutions to A x equal B.

724
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,550
So you -- I think
you've got the idea.

725
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,780
Subspaces have to go
through the origin.

726
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:01,590
If I'm looking at x-s, then
they'd better solve Ax=0.

727
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:04,690
In a way I've got --

728
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:10,800
my two subspaces that I --
talking about today are kind

729
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,340
of the two ways I can tell
you what a -- about subspace.

730
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,100
If I want to tell you
about the column space,

731
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,780
I tell you a few columns and
I say take their combinations.

732
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,330
Like I build up this subspace.

733
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:31,440
I put in a few vectors, their
combinations make a subspace.

734
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,010
Now, when I went to -- let me
come back to the one that is

735
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,180
a subspace here.

736
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,430
Here, when I talked
about the null space,

737
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,960
I didn't tell you what's in it.

738
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,350
We had to figure
out what was in it.

739
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:53,290
What I told you was the
equations that I'm --

740
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,180
that has to be satisfied.

741
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,680
You see those --

742
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,890
like, those are the two
natural ways to tell you

743
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:02,460
what's in a subspace.

744
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,730
I can either give you a few
vectors and say fill it out,

745
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:08,660
take combinations --

746
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:12,800
or I can give you a system of
equations, the requirements

747
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,390
that the x-s have to satisfy.

748
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:20,400
And both of those
ways produce subspaces

749
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,080
and they're the important
ways to construct subspaces.

750
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,730
Okay, so today's
lecture actually got,

751
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:33,260
the essentials of
three point two,

752
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,250
the idea of the null space.

753
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,740
Now we have to
tackle, Wednesday,

754
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,490
the job of how do
we actually get hold

755
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,530
of that subspace in an
example that's bigger

756
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,960
and we can't see it just by eye.

757
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,770
Okay.

758
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:57,190
See you Wednesday.

759
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,740
Thanks.
