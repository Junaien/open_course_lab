1
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,850
OK, here's linear
algebra lecture seven.

2
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,540
I've been talking
about vector spaces

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,050
and specially the
null space of a matrix

4
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,320
and the column
space of a matrix.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,210
What's in those spaces.

6
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,940
Now I want to actually
describe them.

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,050
How do you describe
all the vectors

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,200
that are in those spaces?

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,570
How do you compute these things?

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,380
So this is the, turning
the idea, the definition,

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,590
into an algorithm.

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,410
What's the algorithm
for solving A x =0?

13
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,920
So that's the null space
that I'm interested in.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,630
So can I take a particular
matrix A and describe

15
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,840
the natural algorithm, and I'll
execute it for that matrix --

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,740
here we go.

17
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,740
So let me take the
matrix as an example.

18
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,560
So we're definitely talking
rectangular matrices in this

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,350
chapter.

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,050
So I'll make, I'll
have four columns.

21
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,190
And three rows.

22
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:29,050
Two four six eight and
three six eight ten.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,460
OK.

24
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,330
If I just look at those
columns, and rows, well,

25
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,010
I notice right away
that column two

26
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,860
is a multiple of column one.

27
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,710
It's in the same
direction as column one.

28
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,840
It's not independent.

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,380
I'll expect to discover
that in the process.

30
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,360
Actually, with rows, I notice
that that row plus this row

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,770
gives the third row.

32
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,500
So the third row
is not independent.

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,600
So, all that should
come out of elimination.

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,620
So now what I --

35
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,590
my algorithm is elimination,
but extended now

36
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,420
to the rectangular
case, where we

37
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:30,320
have to continue even if there's
zeros in the pivot position,

38
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,690
we go on.

39
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,880
OK, so let me execute
elimination for that matrix.

40
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,160
My goal is always, while
I'm doing elimination --

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,650
I'm not changing the null space.

42
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,520
That's very important, right?

43
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,840
I'm solving A x equals
zero by elimination,

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,960
and when I do these operations
that you already know,

45
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,120
when I subtract
a multiple of one

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,330
equation from another equation,
I'm not changing the solutions.

47
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,850
So I'm not changing
the null space.

48
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,850
Actually, I changing the
column space, as you'll see.

49
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,130
So you have to pay attention.

50
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,270
What does elimination
leave unchanged?

51
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,310
And the answer is the solutions
to the system are not changed

52
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,890
because I'm doing
the same thing to --

53
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,620
I'm doing a legitimate
operations on the equations.

54
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,130
Of course, on the right
hand side it's always zero,

55
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,860
and I don't plan to
write zero all the time.

56
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,340
OK, so I'm really just
working on the left side,

57
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:39,330
but the right side is, is
keeping up always zeros.

58
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,750
OK, so what's elimination?

59
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,470
Well, you know where
the first pivot is

60
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,060
and you know what to do

61
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,560
with it.

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,580
So can I just take the
first step below here?

63
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,940
So that pivot row is fine.

64
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,300
I take two times that row away
from this one and I get zero

65
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,140
zero.

66
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,570
That's signaling a difficulty.

67
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,660
Two, two twos away from the
six leaves me with a two.

68
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,740
Two twos away from the
eight leaves me with a four.

69
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,040
And now three of
those away from here

70
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,630
is zero, again another
zero, three twos away

71
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,260
from that eight is the
two, three twos away

72
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,200
from that ten is a four.

73
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,250
OK.

74
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,780
That's the first
stage of elimination.

75
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,150
I've got the first
column straight.

76
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,530
So of course I move on
to the second column.

77
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,710
I look in that
position, I see a zero.

78
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,500
I look below it,
hoping for a non-zero

79
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,980
that I can do a row exchange.

80
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,720
But it's zero below.

81
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,330
So that's telling me that
that column is -- well,

82
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,320
what it's really going to be
telling me is that that column

83
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,840
is a combination of
the earlier columns.

84
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,080
It's that second column is
dependent on the earlier

85
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,670
columns.

86
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:09,280
But I don't stop to think here.

87
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,680
In that column
there's nothing to do.

88
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,970
I go on to the next.

89
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,240
So here's the next pivot.

90
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,080
So there's the first pivot
and there's the second pivot,

91
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,660
and I just keep this
elimination going downwards.

92
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:30,720
So, so the next step
keeps the first row,

93
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,600
keeps the second
row with its pivot,

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,510
so I've got my two pivots,
and does elimination

95
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,730
to clear out the column
below that pivot.

96
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,530
So actually you see
the multiplier is one.

97
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,100
It subtracts row
two from row three

98
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,480
and produces a row of zeros.

99
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,190
OK.

100
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,050
That I would call
that matrix U, right?

101
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,870
That's our upper --

102
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,140
well, I can't quite
say upper triangular.

103
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,260
Maybe upper -- I don't
know -- upper something.

104
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,150
It's in this so-called
echelon form.

105
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,700
The word echelon means,
like, staircase form.

106
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,960
It's the, the non-zeros
come in that staircase form.

107
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,720
If there was another pivot
here, then the staircase

108
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,260
would include that.

109
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:37,870
But here's a case where
we have two pivots only.

110
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,320
OK, so actually we've already
discovered the most important

111
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,210
number about this matrix.

112
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,540
The number of pivots is two.

113
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,930
That number we will call
the rank of the matrix.

114
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,520
So let me put immediately.

115
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,696
The rank of A --

116
00:06:58,696 --> 00:07:00,070
so I'm telling
you what this word

117
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,280
rank means in the algorithm.

118
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,650
It's equal to the
number of pivots.

119
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,900
And in this case, two.

120
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,320
OK, for me that number
two is the crucial number.

121
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,310
OK, now I go to -- you remember
I'm always solving A x equals

122
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,240
zero, but now I can solve
U x equals zero, right?

123
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,650
Same solution, same null space.

124
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,150
OK.

125
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,830
So I could stop here --

126
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,810
why don't I stop here and
do the back substitution.

127
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:42,750
So now I have to ask you, how
do I describe the solutions?

128
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,880
There are solutions,
right, to A x equals zero.

129
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,070
I knew there would be.

130
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,110
I had three equations
in four unknowns.

131
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,850
I certainly expected
some solutions.

132
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,240
Now I want to see what are they.

133
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,800
OK, here's the critical step.

134
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,860
I refer to it up here
as separating out

135
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,990
the pivot variables, the pivot
columns, which are these two.

136
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,080
Here I have two pivot columns.

137
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,530
Those, obviously, they're
the columns with the pivots.

138
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,736
So I have two pivot columns.

139
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,750
And I have the other
columns, I'll call free.

140
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,235
These are free columns, OK.

141
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,470
Why do I use those words?

142
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,110
Why do I use that word free?

143
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,289
Because now I want to write, I
want to find the solutions to U

144
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,210
x equals zero.

145
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,090
Here is the way I do it.

146
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:58,040
These free columns I can assign
any number freely to those --

147
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,900
to the variables x2 and
x4, the ones that multiply

148
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,570
columns two and four.

149
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,620
So I can assign anything
I like to x2 and x4.

150
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:17,430
And then I can solve the
equations for x1 and x3.

151
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,450
Let me say that again.

152
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,390
If I give -- let
me, let me assign.

153
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:29,320
So, so one particular x is
to assign, say, the value one

154
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,640
to the, to x2, and zero to x4.

155
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,850
Those are -- that
was a free choice,

156
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,031
but it's a convenient choice.

157
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:38,530
OK.

158
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,140
Now I want to solve
U x equals zero

159
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:47,780
and find numbers one and
three, complete the solution.

160
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,481
Can I write down --

161
00:09:49,481 --> 00:09:49,980
let's see.

162
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,480
OK.

163
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,220
Shall we just remember what
U x equals zero represents?

164
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,730
What are my equations?

165
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:00,900
That first equation
is x1 plus just --

166
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,770
I'm just saying what are
these matrices meaning.

167
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,580
That's the first equation.

168
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:14,040
And the second equation
was 2x3 + 4x4=0.

169
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,330
Those are my two equations.

170
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,020
OK.

171
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:24,600
Now the point is I can find x1
and x3 by back substitution.

172
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,500
So we're building on
what we already know.

173
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,970
The new thing is that there
were some free variables that I

174
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,120
could give any numbers to.

175
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,260
And I'm systematically going
to make a choice like this, Now

176
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,760
what is x3?

177
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,920
1 and 0.

178
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,970
Let's, let's go
backwards, back up.

179
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,360
I look at the last equation.

180
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,740
x3 is zero, from
the last equation,

181
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,790
because, because x4
we've set x4 to zero,

182
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,180
and then we get x3 as zero.

183
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,680
OK.

184
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,400
Now we set x2 to be
one, so what is x1?

185
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,050
Negative two, right?

186
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,150
So then I have negative two
plus two, zero and zero,

187
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,400
correctly giving zero.

188
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,810
There is a vector
in the null space.

189
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,530
There is a solution
to A x equals zero.

190
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,740
In fact, what solution is that?

191
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,360
That simply says that minus
two times the first column

192
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,502
plus one times the second
column is the zero column.

193
00:11:28,502 --> 00:11:29,460
Of course that's right.

194
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,310
Minus two of that column plus
one of that, or minus two

195
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,580
of that plus one of that.

196
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,620
That solution is -- that, that's
just what we saw immediately,

197
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,690
that the second column is twice
as big as the first column.

198
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,400
OK, tell me some more
vectors in the null space.

199
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,580
I found one.

200
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:58,030
Tell me, how to get a bunch more
immediately out of that one.

201
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,620
Just take multiples of it.

202
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,440
Any multiple of --

203
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,200
I could multiply
this by anything.

204
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,430
I might as well call it, I could
say, C, some multiple of this.

205
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,380
So let me --

206
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,890
so X could be any
multiple of this one.

207
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,700
OK, that, that
describes now a line,

208
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,430
an infinitely long line
in four dimensional space.

209
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,720
But -- which is
in the null space.

210
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,390
Is that the whole null space?

211
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,460
No.

212
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,220
I've got two free
variables here.

213
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,330
I made this choice, one and
zero, for the free variables,

214
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,090
but I could have
made another choice.

215
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,420
Let me make the other
choice zero and one.

216
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,140
You see my system.

217
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,580
So let me repeat the system.

218
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,087
This is the algorithm that
you, you just learned to do.

219
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,100
Do elimination.

220
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,060
Decide which are
the pivot columns

221
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,420
and which are the free columns.

222
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,600
That tells you that, that
variables one and three

223
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,760
are pivot variables, two
and four are free variables.

224
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,800
Then those free variables,
you assign them --

225
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,870
you give one of them the value
one and the others the value

226
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,070
zero -- in this case, we
had a one and a zero --

227
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,080
and complete the solution.

228
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,550
And you do -- you give the other
one the value one and zero.

229
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,160
And now complete the solution.

230
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,310
So let's complete that solution.

231
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,790
I'm looking for a vector
in the null space,

232
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,550
and it's absolutely going to
be different from this guy,

233
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,350
because, because any
multiple of that zero

234
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,920
is never going to give the one.

235
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,050
So I have somebody
new in the null space,

236
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:46,930
and let me finish it

237
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,430
out.

238
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,140
What's x3 here?

239
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,360
So we're going by
back substitution,

240
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,790
looking at this equation.

241
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:59,680
Now x4 we've changed, we're
doing the other possibility,

242
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,870
where x2 is zero and x4 is one.

243
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,590
So x3 will happen
to be minus two.

244
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,510
And now what do I get
for that first equation?

245
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,420
x1 -- let's see.

246
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:19,430
Two x3s is minus four plus
two -- do I get a two there?

247
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,270
Perhaps, yeah.

248
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:25,500
Two for x1, minus four, and two.

249
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,020
OK.

250
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,360
That's in the null space.

251
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,220
What does that say
about the columns?

252
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,320
That says that two of
this column minus two

253
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,900
of this column plus this column
gives zero, which it does.

254
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,090
Two of that minus two
of that and one of that

255
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,520
gives the zero column.

256
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,420
OK, now, now I've found another
vector in the null space.

257
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,880
Now we're ready to tell
me the whole null space.

258
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,160
What are all the
solutions to Ax=0?

259
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,660
I've got this guy
and when I have him,

260
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,660
what else is, goes into the
null space along with that?

261
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,760
These are my two
special solutions.

262
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,710
I call them special --

263
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,250
I just invented that name.

264
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,110
Special solutions.

265
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,180
What's special about them
is the special numbers

266
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,360
I gave to the free variables,
the values zero and one

267
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,300
for the free variables.

268
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,560
I could have given the
free variables any values

269
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,440
and got vectors
in the null space.

270
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,210
But this was a good way to be
sure I got t- got everybody.

271
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:45,480
OK, so once I have him, I
also have any multiple, right?

272
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,700
So I could take any
multiple of that

273
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,910
and it's in the null space.

274
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,150
And now what else --

275
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,090
I left a little space for what?

276
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,910
What -- a plus sign.

277
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,580
I can take any combination.

278
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,050
Here is a line of vectors
in the null space.

279
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,110
A bunch of solutions.

280
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,540
Would you rather I say in the
null space or would you rather

281
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,330
I say, OK, I'm solving Ax=0?

282
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,545
Well, really I'm solving Ux=0.

283
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,290
Well, OK, let me put in
that crucial plus sign.

284
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:29,420
I'm taking all the combinations
of my two special solutions.

285
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,140
That's my conclusion there.

286
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:37,300
The null space contains,
contains exactly

287
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,270
all the combinations of
the special solutions.

288
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,020
And how many special
solutions are there?

289
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,650
There's one for
every free variable.

290
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,330
And how many free
variables are there?

291
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,860
Oh, I mean, we can see
all the whole picture now.

292
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,830
If the rank R was
two, this is the,

293
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:04,260
this is the number of
pivot variables, right,

294
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,569
because it counted the pivots.

295
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,960
So how many free variables?

296
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,970
Well, you know it's two, right?

297
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:20,260
What is it in -- for a matrix
that's m rows, n columns,

298
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:25,010
n variables that
means, with rank r?

299
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,420
How many free variables
have we got left?

300
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:34,440
If r of the variables are
pivot variables, we have n-r --

301
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,400
in this case four minus
two -- free variables.

302
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:53,390
Do you see that first of all
we get clean answers here?

303
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:59,300
We get r pivot variables -- so
there really were r equations

304
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,170
here.

305
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,990
There looked like
three equations,

306
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,730
but there were really only
two independent equations.

307
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:11,820
And there were n-r variables
that we could choose freely,

308
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,400
and we gave them those
special zero one values,

309
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,180
and we got the
special solutions.

310
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,680
OK.

311
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,710
For me -- we could
stop at that point.

312
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,580
That gives you a
complete algorithm

313
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:34,690
for finding all the
solutions to A x equals zero.

314
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,190
OK.

315
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,720
Again, you do elimination --

316
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,050
going onward when a column,
when there's nothing

317
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:50,570
to be done on one column,
you just continue.

318
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,360
There's this number r, the
number of pivots, is crucial,

319
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,150
and it leaves n-r free
variables, which you

320
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,100
give values zero and one to.

321
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,390
I would like to
take one more step.

322
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,020
I would like to clean up
this matrix even more.

323
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,930
So now I'm going to go
to -- this is in its,

324
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:20,420
this is in echelon form,
upper triangular if you like.

325
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,660
I want to go one more step to
make it as good as it can be.

326
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:31,310
OK, so now I'm going to speak
about the reduced row echelon

327
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,200
form.

328
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,540
OK, so now I'm going to speak
about the matrix R, which is

329
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:44,680
the reduced row echelon form.

330
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,700
So what does that mean?

331
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,470
That means I just --

332
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,370
I can, I can work harder on U.

333
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,310
So let me start, let
me suppose I got as far

334
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,125
as U, which was good.

335
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,450
Notice how that row
of zeros appeared.

336
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,360
I didn't comment on
that, but I should have.

337
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,630
That row of zeros up here
is because row three was

338
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,060
a combination of
rows one and two,

339
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,390
and elimination
discovered that fact.

340
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:32,610
When we get a row of zeros,
that's telling us that the --

341
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:38,580
original row that was there was
a combination of other rows,

342
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,630
and elimination knocked it out.

343
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,710
OK, so we got this far.

344
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,260
Now how can I clean
that up further?

345
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,430
I can do, elimination upwards.

346
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,390
I can get zero above the pivots.

347
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,740
So this reduced row
echelon form has zeros

348
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:05,745
above and below the pivots.

349
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,460
So let me do that.

350
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,940
So now I'll subtract one
of this from the row above.

351
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,150
That will leave a zero
and a minus two in there.

352
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,540
And that's good.

353
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,710
OK, and I can clean it
up even one more step.

354
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,400
I can make the pivots --

355
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,300
the pivots I'm going to make
equal to one, because I can

356
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,380
divide equation
two by the pivot.

357
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,110
That won't change the solutions.

358
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,940
So let me do that.

359
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,870
And then I really --

360
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,910
I'm ready to stop.

361
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:53,230
One, two, zero, minus
two, zero, zero, one, two.

362
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:58,000
I divided the second
equation by two,

363
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,560
because now I have a one in
the pivot and zeros below.

364
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,060
OK.

365
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:14,790
This is my matrix R.

366
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,810
I guess I'm hoping
that you could now

367
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:21,710
execute the whole algorithm.

368
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:27,518
Matlab will do it immediately
with the command --

369
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,490
reduced row echelon form of A.

370
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,630
So if I input that
original matrix A

371
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:43,360
and then I write, then I type
that command, press return,

372
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,210
that matrix will appear.

373
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,140
That's the reduced
row echelon form,

374
00:22:49,140 --> 00:23:00,140
and it's got all the
information as clear as can be.

375
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,890
What, what information
has it got?

376
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,000
Well, of course it
immediately tells me

377
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,530
the pivot rows, pivot
rows, one and two,

378
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,490
pivot columns, one and three.

379
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,240
And in fact it's got the
identity matrix in there,

380
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,820
It's, it's got zeros above
and below the pivots, right?

381
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,460
and the pivots are one,
so it's, so it's got a --

382
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:30,180
so notice the two by two
identity matrix that's sitting

383
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,370
in the pivot rows
and pivot columns.

384
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:42,710
it's I in the pivot
rows and columns.

385
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,930
It's got zero rows below.

386
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,580
Those are always indicating
that original rows were,

387
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,740
were combinations of other rows.

388
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,100
So we really only
had two rows there.

389
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,740
And now it also -- so
there's the identity.

390
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,740
Now it's also got
its free columns.

391
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:17,160
And, they're cleaned
up as much as possible.

392
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,720
Actually, actually it's now
so cleaned up that the special

393
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,070
solutions, I can read off --
you remember I went through

394
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:30,220
the steps of computing this --

395
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,760
doing back substitution?

396
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,390
Let me, let me,
instead of that system,

397
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,600
let me take this
improved system.

398
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,850
So I'm going to use
these numbers, right.

399
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,850
In these equations,
what did I do?

400
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:52,820
I divided this equation
by two and, oh yeah

401
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,540
and I had subtracted
two of this,

402
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,290
which knocked out this guy
and made that a minus sign.

403
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,500
Is that what --

404
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,570
I've now written Rx equals zero.

405
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:14,570
Now I guess I'm hoping everybody
in this room understands

406
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,150
the solutions to the
original A x equals zero,

407
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:23,050
the midway, halfway,
U x equals zero,

408
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:27,980
and the final R x equals
zero are all the same.

409
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,900
Because going from one
of those to another one

410
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,330
I didn't mess up.

411
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,280
I just multiplied
equations and subtracted

412
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,840
from other equations,
which I'm allowed to do.

413
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,340
OK.

414
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:47,530
But my point is that now
if I do this free variables

415
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:52,410
and back substitution, it's
just, the numbers are there.

416
00:25:52,410 --> 00:26:01,040
When I let x -- so in this guy,
I let x2 be one and x4 be zero.

417
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,380
I, I guess, what I seeing here?

418
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,070
Let me, let me sort of
separate this out here.

419
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:12,100
I'm seeing in the pivot,
in the pivot columns,

420
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,910
if I, if I put the pivot
columns here, I'm seeing those.

421
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:21,970
And I'm -- in the free
columns I'm seeing --

422
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,570
what I seeing in
the free columns?

423
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:29,030
A two, zero in that first
free column, the x2 column,

424
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:33,920
and a minus two, two
in the fourth column,

425
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,010
the other free column.

426
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:41,750
And the row of zeros below,
which of course have no --

427
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,860
that equation is
zero equals zero.

428
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,080
That's satisfied.

429
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,530
Here's my point.

430
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,220
That when I do
back substitution,

431
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,700
these numbers are
exactly what shows up --

432
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,480
oh, their signs get switched.

433
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,550
I was going to say those
numbers, two, minus two, zero,

434
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:06,240
two, can I just circle the
-- this is the free part

435
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,120
of the matrix.

436
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,220
This is the identity part.

437
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,710
This is the free part,
maybe I'll call it F.

438
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:18,650
This, of course, I call I,
because it's the identity.

439
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:25,020
The free part is a, I mean, I'm
just doing back substitution.

440
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,340
And those free numbers will
show up, with a minus sign,

441
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,040
because they pop onto the
other side of the equation --

442
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,870
so I see minus two, zero,
and I see two, minus two.

443
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,310
So that wasn't magic.

444
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,540
It had to happen.

445
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:48,240
Let me, show you
clearly why it happened.

446
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,340
OK, so that's --

447
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,290
this is what I'm
interested in here.

448
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:59,410
And now let me, let me just,
like, do it, do it for --

449
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:04,530
let's suppose we've,
we've got to --

450
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,940
let's suppose we've got
this system already in,

451
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:18,200
in rref form.

452
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,580
So my matrix R is --
what does it look like?

453
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,130
OK, and I'll --

454
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:30,570
let me pretend that the
pivot columns come first

455
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,220
and then whatever's
in the free columns.

456
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,970
And there might be
some zero rows below.

457
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,600
There's a typical --

458
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,750
a pretty typical reduced
row echelon form.

459
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,510
You see what's typical.

460
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,430
It's got -- this is r by r.

461
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,950
This is r pivot rows.

462
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,050
This is r pivot columns.

463
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:16,290
And here are n-r free columns.

464
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,480
OK.

465
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,650
Tell me what are the
special solutions?

466
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,350
What are the --

467
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,060
what's x?

468
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,440
If I want to solve
R x equals zero --

469
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,170
in fact, let me --

470
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:36,110
I'm really going to, do
the whole -- since these --

471
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,030
this is now block matrices,
I might as well do all

472
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,300
of the special
solutions at once.

473
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,740
So I want to solve
R x equals zero,

474
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,660
and I'll have some
special solutions.

475
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,830
Let me, actually --

476
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,780
can I do them all at once?

477
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:00,750
I'm going to create a
null space matrix, OK.

478
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,790
A matrix.

479
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:13,130
Its, its, its columns
are the special --

480
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,085
the columns are the
special solutions.

481
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,070
This is, I'm making
it sound harder,

482
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,670
it's going to be totally easy.

483
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:25,800
N will be this
null space matrix.

484
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,070
I want R N to be
the zero matrix.

485
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,830
These columns of N are
supposed to multipl-

486
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:37,300
to get multiplied by R
and give zero columns.

487
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,100
So what N will do the job?

488
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,450
Let me put --

489
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:45,290
I'm going to put the identity
in the free variable part

490
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:54,020
and then minus F will show up
in the pivot variables, just

491
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,980
the way it did in that example.

492
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,970
There we had the identity and F.

493
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,160
Here -- in the special solution.

494
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,400
So these columns are --
there's the matrix of special

495
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,430
solutions.

496
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,460
And actually, there -- so
there's a Matlab command

497
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:14,360
or a teaching code
command, NULL --

498
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,460
N equal, so this is the --

499
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,710
produces the null basis, the
null space matrix, NULL of A,

500
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,230
and there it is.

501
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,630
And how does that
command actually work?

502
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:38,590
It uses Matlab to
compute R, then

503
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,100
it picks out the pivot
variables, the free variables,

504
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,980
puts, puts ones and zeros
in for the free variables,

505
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,850
and copies out the
pivot variables.

506
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,760
It, it does back substitution,
but back substitution

507
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,180
for this system
is totally simple.

508
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,070
What is this system?

509
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,030
R x equals zero.

510
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:11,620
So this is R is I F, and
x is the pivot variables

511
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:18,240
and the free variables, and
it's supposed to give zero.

512
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,240
So what does that mean?

513
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,960
That means that the
pivot variables plus F

514
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,640
times the free
variables give zero.

515
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,950
So let me put F times the free
variables on the other side.

516
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:37,950
I get minus F times
the free variables.

517
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:43,530
There's my, equation,
as simple as it can be.

518
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,840
That's what back
substitution comes

519
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,280
to when I've reduced and
reduced and reduced this system

520
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,090
to the, to the best form, OK.

521
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:56,680
And, then if the
free variables, I

522
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,070
make this special
choice of the identity,

523
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,570
then the pivot variables are

524
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:08,710
minus F. OK, can I
do, another example?

525
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,180
Could you do another example?

526
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,300
Can I -- let me just
take another matrix

527
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:17,330
and, and let's go through
this algorithm once more, OK.

528
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,180
Here we go.

529
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:25,100
Here's a blackboard
for another matrix, OK.

530
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:31,180
So I'll call the matrix A
again, but let me make it --

531
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,680
yeah, how big shall
we make it this time?

532
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,620
Why don't I do this?

533
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,920
Just for the heck of it.

534
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,860
Let me take the transpose of
this A and see what happens to

535
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,670
that.

536
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:55,820
Two four six eight and
three six eight ten.

537
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:06,380
Before we do the calculations,
tell me what's coming?

538
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:12,170
How many pivot variables
do you expect here?

539
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:16,900
How many columns are
going to have pivots?

540
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:22,060
How many -- we have three
columns in that matrix,

541
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,739
but are we going to, are we
going to have three pivots?

542
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:31,429
No, because this third columns
is the sum of the first two

543
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,100
columns.

544
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:38,350
I'm totally expecting, totally
expecting that these will be

545
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,000
pivot columns --

546
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,949
because they're independent,
but that this third guy,

547
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:49,659
the third column, which is
dependent on the first two,

548
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:52,219
is going to be a free column.

549
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:54,889
Elimination better
discover that.

550
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:58,270
And elimination will
also straighten out

551
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:05,170
the rows, dependent rows
and some independent rows.

552
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,510
What's the, what's the row
reduced echelon form for this?

553
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,970
Let's just do it, OK.

554
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:16,710
So, so that's the first pivot.

555
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,360
Two times that away from
that gives me a row of zeros.

556
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,970
Two times that away from
that gives me a zero two two.

557
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:28,865
And two times that away from
that gives me a zero four four.

558
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,750
OK, first column is straight.

559
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,780
First variable is
a pivot variable.

560
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,010
No problem.

561
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,370
On to the second column.

562
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,880
I look at the second
pivot, it's a zero.

563
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,430
I look below it.

564
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,740
There's a two.

565
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,890
OK, I do a row exchange.

566
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,630
So this zero is now there.

567
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,710
I now have a perfectly
good pivot, and I use it.

568
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,030
OK, and I subtract two of
that row away from this row.

569
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,630
All right if I do it like that?

570
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,310
I've got to the form U now.

571
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,460
This was my A.

572
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:17,260
Now there's my U.
I can see now --

573
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,630
I have to stop, right?

574
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,340
I would go on to
the third column.

575
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,650
I should have tried.

576
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,120
I quit, but without trying.

577
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,440
I shouldn't have done that.

578
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,810
On to the third column,
look at the pivot position.

579
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,100
It's got a zero in it.

580
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,300
Look below, all zeros.

581
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,660
Now I'm entitled to stop, OK.

582
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,445
So the rank is two again.

583
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,440
What about the null space?

584
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,450
How many special solutions
are there this time?

585
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,990
How many special
solutions for this matrix?

586
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,600
I've got -- and which are the
free variables and which are

587
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,400
the pivot variables and so on?

588
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,610
Pivot columns, I've
got two pivot columns,

589
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,890
and that's no accident.

590
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:11,200
The number of pivot columns
for a matrix A, that's

591
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,120
a great fact, that the
number of pivot columns for A

592
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,250
and A transpose are the same.

593
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,680
And then I have a free column.

594
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,240
There's a free column.

595
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,330
One free column, because the
count is three minus two.

596
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,990
Three minus two gives
me one free column.

597
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:47,410
OK, so now let me solve,
what's in the null space.

598
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,390
OK, so how do I --

599
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,530
let's see.

600
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,800
These vectors have length three.

601
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,480
They only have three components.

602
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,200
I'm making too much space
for the, to write x.

603
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,320
x has just got three
components, and what are they?

604
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,340
I'm looking for the null space.

605
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,430
OK, so how do I start?

606
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:17,710
I give the free variable
some convenient value.

607
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,290
And what's that?

608
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,000
I set it to one.

609
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,970
I set the free variable to one.

610
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,520
If I set the free
variable to zero and solve

611
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,300
for the pivot variables, I'll
get all zeros: no progress.

612
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,430
But by setting the
free variable to one --

613
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:39,680
you see w- my two
equations now are --

614
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,230
my equations are x1+
2x2+ 3 x3 is zero,

615
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,200
that's my first equation.

616
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,130
And my second equation is
now 2x2+2x3 equals zero.

617
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:56,110
And, OK.

618
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:02,400
So if x3 is one,
then x2 is minus one.

619
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,430
And if x3 is one and x2 is
minus one, then maybe x1

620
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,510
is minus one.

621
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,360
And actually I go
back to check now.

622
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,410
I don't, like --

623
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,410
I did a quick
calculation mentally.

624
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,570
Can I mentally do a quick check?

625
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,180
That matrix, that
solution x says

626
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:28,710
that minus this column minus
this column plus this one

627
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,560
is the zero column.

628
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,860
And it is.

629
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,510
Minus that minus that
plus that is zero.

630
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,720
So that's in the null space.

631
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,790
And now you can tell me what
else is in the null space.

632
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:44,080
What's, what's the
whole null space now?

633
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,570
I multiply by C, right.

634
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:51,720
The whole null space is a line.

635
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,970
So that's the description.

636
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:57,520
You know, if I ask you on a
homework or a quiz or the final

637
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,630
what -- give me, describe,
tell me the null space,

638
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,410
find the null space
of this matrix,

639
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:07,340
you can take those steps.

640
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,790
And that's the answer
I'm looking for.

641
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:15,190
And I'm looking for that C
too, because that's telling me

642
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,360
that you're remembering that
it's a whole space and not

643
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,640
just one vector.

644
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,960
Later I will ask you for a
basis for the null space.

645
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,850
Then I just want this vector.

646
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,840
But if I ask for the
whole null space,

647
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,510
then there's the whole
line through that vector.

648
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:36,340
OK, now one more natural thing
to do with this example, right,

649
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:43,300
is keep going to the
reduced matrix, R.

650
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,180
So can I push onwards to R?

651
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,340
That should be quick,
but let's just practice.

652
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:54,000
Let me keep going to R.
OK, so what do I do here?

653
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,970
I subtract --

654
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,830
I clear out above
the pivot, so I

655
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:02,870
subtract that from that, that's
one zero one is left, right?

656
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,740
When I subtracted
this row from this

657
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,390
it produced a zero
above this pivot.

658
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:12,070
And now I want that
pivot to be a one.

659
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:18,160
So for the R matrix, I'll
divide this equation by two,

660
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,270
and of course these zero, zeros
are great, they don't change.

661
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,700
There's R.

662
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,370
That's R.

663
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,430
You see what R is?

664
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:32,100
You see the identity
matrix sitting up here?

665
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,370
You see the free part
F, the F part here?

666
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,370
And you see the zeros below.

667
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:42,460
This is I F zero zero.

668
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,180
And what's the x?

669
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,660
The x has the identity --

670
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,460
well, it's only a
single number one,

671
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:56,090
but it's the identity matrix
in the free, in the free part.

672
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:00,770
And what does it have
in the pivot variables?

673
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,620
What did back substitution give?

674
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,910
It gave minus these guys.

675
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:11,160
You see that what this
is is any multiple of --

676
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,360
this is the identity there,
and this is minus F here.

677
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:24,710
This is our null space
matrix N for this.

678
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,490
Our, our null space matrix
is the guy whose columns

679
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,680
are the special solutions.

680
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,570
So their free variables
have the special values

681
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:39,510
one and, pivot
variables have minus F.

682
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,210
So do you see, though,
how the minus F just

683
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,540
automatically shows up
in the special solutions.

684
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,389
That's it really.

685
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:51,930
I don't think there's
anything more I

686
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:55,980
can say about A x equals zero.

687
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,640
There's more I can
say about A x equal b,

688
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,080
but that'll be on Friday.
