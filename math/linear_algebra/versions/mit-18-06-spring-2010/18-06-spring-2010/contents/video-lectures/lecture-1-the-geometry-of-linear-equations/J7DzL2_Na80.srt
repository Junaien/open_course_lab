00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:09,210
Hi.

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,230
This is the first lecture
in MIT's course 18.06,

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:19,430
linear algebra, and
I'm Gilbert Strang.

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,440
The text for the
course is this book,

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,070
Introduction to Linear Algebra.

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,729
And the course web page, which
has got a lot of exercises from

7
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,470
the past, MatLab codes, the
syllabus for the course,

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:44,060
is web.mit.edu/18.06.

9
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,350
And this is the first
lecture, lecture one.

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,490
So, and later we'll give the
web address for viewing these,

11
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,270
videotapes.

12
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,200
Okay, so what's in
the first lecture?

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,530
This is my plan.

14
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,340
The fundamental problem
of linear algebra,

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,880
which is to solve a system
of linear equations.

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,210
So let's start
with a case when we

17
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:21,440
have some number of equations,
say n equations and n unknowns.

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,820
So an equal number of
equations and unknowns.

19
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,860
That's the normal, nice case.

20
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,870
And what I want to do is --
with examples, of course --

21
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:37,230
to describe, first, what
I call the Row picture.

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,870
That's the picture of
one equation at a time.

23
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,980
It's the picture you've
seen before in two

24
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,350
by two equations
where lines meet.

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,460
So in a minute, you'll
see lines meeting.

26
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,230
The second picture,
I'll put a star

27
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,070
beside that, because that's
such an important one.

28
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:01,600
And maybe new to you is the
picture -- a column at a time.

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,440
And those are the rows
and columns of a matrix.

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,970
So the third -- the algebra
way to look at the problem is

31
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,790
the matrix form and using
a matrix that I'll call A.

32
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,490
Okay, so can I do an example?

33
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:23,420
The whole semester will be
examples and then see what's

34
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,110
going on with the example.

35
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,990
So, take an example.

36
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,430
Two equations, two unknowns.

37
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:38,290
So let me take 2x
-y =0, let's say.

38
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:45,350
And -x 2y=3.

39
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,530
Okay.

40
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,680
let me -- I can even
say right away --

41
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:57,650
what's the matrix, that is,
what's the coefficient matrix?

42
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,590
The matrix that involves
these numbers --

43
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,190
a matrix is just a
rectangular array of numbers.

44
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,610
Here it's two rows and
two columns, so 2 and --

45
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,420
minus 1 in the first row minus
1 and 2 in the second row,

46
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,700
that's the matrix.

47
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,610
And the right-hand
-- the, unknown --

48
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,090
well, we've got two unknowns.

49
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,370
So we've got a vector, with
two components, x and y,

50
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,150
and we've got two right-hand
sides that go into a vector

51
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,940
0 3.

52
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,260
I couldn't resist writing
the matrix form, right --

53
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,050
even before the pictures.

54
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,030
So I always will think
of this as the matrix A,

55
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,440
the matrix of coefficients,
then there's a vector of

56
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,030
unknowns.

57
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,790
Here we've only
got two unknowns.

58
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,100
Later we'll have any
number of unknowns.

59
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,620
And that vector of
unknowns, well I'll often --

60
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,820
I'll make that x --

61
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,150
extra bold.

62
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,850
A and the right-hand
side is also a vector

63
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,230
that I'll always call b.

64
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,790
So linear equations are A
x equal b and the idea now

65
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,820
is to solve this
particular example

66
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,940
and then step back to
see the bigger picture.

67
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,630
Okay, what's the picture for
this example, the Row picture?

68
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,740
Okay, so here comes
the Row picture.

69
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,890
So that means I take
one row at a time

70
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:38,520
and I'm drawing
here the xy plane

71
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,990
and I'm going to plot
all the points that

72
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,860
satisfy that first equation.

73
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,120
So I'm looking at all the
points that satisfy 2x-y =0.

74
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,000
It's often good to start with
which point on the horizontal

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,480
line -- on this horizontal
line, y is zero.

76
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,510
The x axis has y as zero and
that -- in this case, actually,

77
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,720
then x is zero.

78
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,230
So the point, the origin --

79
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:16,560
the point with coordinates
(0,0) is on the line.

80
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,290
It solves that equation.

81
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,340
Okay, tell me in -- well,
I guess I have to tell you

82
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,980
another point that solves
this same equation.

83
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,090
Let me suppose x is one,
so I'll take x to be one.

84
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,930
Then y should be two, right?

85
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:40,250
So there's the point one two
that also solves this equation.

86
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,840
And I could put in more points.

87
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,720
But, but let me put
in all the points

88
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,810
at once, because they all
lie on a straight line.

89
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,540
This is a linear equation
and that word linear

90
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,310
got the letters

91
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,760
Okay, thanks. for line in it.

92
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,760
That's the equation --
this is the line that ...

93
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:08,690
of solutions to 2x-y=0 my
first row, first equation.

94
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:14,060
So typically, maybe, x equal
a half, y equal one will work.

95
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,660
And sure enough it does.

96
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,600
Okay, that's the first one.

97
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,750
Now the second one is not
going to go through the origin.

98
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,390
It's always important.

99
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,900
Do we go through
the origin or not?

100
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,020
In this case, yes, because
there's a zero over there.

101
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,270
In this case we don't
go through the origin,

102
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,220
because if x and y are
zero, we don't get three.

103
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,350
So, let me again say
suppose y is zero,

104
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,560
what x do we actually get?

105
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,230
If y is zero, then I
get x is minus three.

106
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,610
So if y is zero, I
go along minus three.

107
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,360
So there's one point
on this second line.

108
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:03,450
Now let me say, well,
suppose x is minus one --

109
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,370
just to take another x.

110
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,280
If x is minus one,
then this is a one

111
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,870
and I think y should be a one,
because if x is minus one,

112
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,790
then I think y should be a
one and we'll get that point.

113
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,900
Is that right?

114
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,330
If x is minus one, that's a one.

115
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,640
If y is a one, that's
a two and the one

116
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,550
and the two make three and
that point's on the equation.

117
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,330
Okay.

118
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,740
Now, I should just
draw the line, right,

119
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,470
connecting those
two points at --

120
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,410
that will give me
the whole line.

121
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,480
And if I've done
this reasonably well,

122
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,640
I think it's going to happen
to go through -- well,

123
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,520
not happen -- it was arranged
to go through that point.

124
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,600
So I think that the
second line is this one,

125
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,100
and this is the all-important
point that lies on both lines.

126
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,830
Shall we just check
that that point which

127
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,690
is the point x equal one
and y was two, right?

128
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,790
That's the point there
and that, I believe,

129
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,530
solves both equations.

130
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,500
Let's just check this.

131
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:18,590
If x is one, I have a minus one
plus four equals three, okay.

132
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,680
Apologies for
drawing this picture

133
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,150
that you've seen before.

134
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,690
But this -- seeing
the row picture --

135
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,140
first of all, for n equal 2,
two equations and two unknowns,

136
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,460
it's the right place to start.

137
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,270
Okay.

138
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,690
So we've got the solution.

139
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,679
The point that
lies on both lines.

140
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,600
Now can I come to
the column picture?

141
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,880
Pay attention, this
is the key point.

142
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,930
So the column picture.

143
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,520
I'm now going to look at
the columns of the matrix.

144
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,790
I'm going to look at
this part and this part.

145
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:05,010
I'm going to say that the
x part is really x times --

146
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,740
you see, I'm putting the two --

147
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,160
I'm kind of getting the
two equations at once --

148
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,290
that part and then I have a
y and in the first equation

149
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,260
it's multiplying a minus one and
in the second equation a two,

150
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,030
and on the right-hand
side, zero and three.

151
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,860
You see, the columns of the
matrix, the columns of A

152
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,050
are here and the
right-hand side b is there.

153
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,940
And now what is the
equation asking for?

154
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,750
It's asking us to find --
somehow to combine that vector

155
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,470
and this one in the right
amounts to get that one.

156
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,830
It's asking us to find the
right linear combination --

157
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,420
this is called a
linear combination.

158
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,840
And it's the most fundamental
operation in the whole course.

159
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,330
It's a linear combination
of the columns.

160
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,550
That's what we're
seeing on the left side.

161
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,190
Again, I don't want to
write down a big definition.

162
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,010
You can see what it is.

163
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,470
There's column one,
there's column two.

164
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,690
I multiply by some
numbers and I add.

165
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,940
That's a combination -- a linear
combination and I want to make

166
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,870
those numbers the right
numbers to produce zero three.

167
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,070
Okay.

168
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,110
Now I want to draw a picture
that, represents what this --

169
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,230
this is algebra.

170
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,740
What's the geometry, what's
the picture that goes with it?

171
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,360
Okay.

172
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,260
So again, these vectors
have two components,

173
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,730
so I better draw a
picture like that.

174
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,680
So can I put down these columns?

175
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,470
I'll draw these
columns as they are,

176
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,700
and then I'll do a
combination of them.

177
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:04,000
So the first column is over
two and down one, right?

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,210
So there's the first column.

179
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,860
The first column.

180
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,960
Column one.

181
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,830
It's the vector two minus one.

182
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,580
The second column is --

183
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,000
minus one is the first
component and up two.

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,960
It's here.

185
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,710
There's column two.

186
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:32,280
So this, again, you see
what its components are.

187
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,530
Its components are
minus one, two.

188
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,030
Good.

189
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,840
That's this guy.

190
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:40,845
Now I have to take
a combination.

191
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,310
What combination shall I take?

192
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,510
Why not the right
combination, what the hell?

193
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,010
Okay.

194
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,840
So the combination
I'm going to take

195
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,250
is the right one to
produce zero three

196
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,620
and then we'll see it
happen in the picture.

197
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,530
So the right combination is
to take x as one of those

198
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,140
and two of these.

199
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,760
It's because we already know
that that's the right x and y,

200
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,720
so why not take the correct
combination here and see it

201
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,280
happen?

202
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,840
Okay, so how do I picture
this linear combination?

203
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,180
So I start with this vector
that's already here --

204
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,220
so that's one of column
one, that's one times column

205
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,400
one, right there.

206
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,720
And now I want to add on --
so I'm going to hook the next

207
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,660
vector onto the front of the
arrow will start the next

208
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,590
vector and it will go this way.

209
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,170
So let's see, can I do it right?

210
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,240
If I added on one
of these vectors,

211
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,589
it would go left one and up two,
so we'd go left one and up two,

212
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:52,130
so it would probably
get us to there.

213
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,650
Maybe I'll do dotted
line for that.

214
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,610
Okay?

215
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,710
That's one of column
two tucked onto the end,

216
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,390
but I wanted to tuck
on two of column two.

217
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,000
So that -- the second one --
we'll go up left one and up two

218
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,660
also.

219
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,440
It'll probably end there.

220
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,520
And there's another one.

221
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,350
So what I've put in here
is two of column two.

222
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,340
Added on.

223
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,615
And where did I end up?

224
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,230
What are the coordinates
of this result?

225
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,570
What do I get when I take
one of this plus two of that?

226
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,810
I do get that, of course.

227
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,870
There it is, x is zero,
y is three, that's b.

228
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,530
That's the answer we wanted.

229
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,530
And how do I do it?

230
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,860
You see I do it just
like the first component.

231
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,700
I have a two and a minus
two that produces a zero,

232
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,680
and in the second component I
have a minus one and a four,

233
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,750
they combine to give the three.

234
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,190
But look at this picture.

235
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,230
So here's our key picture.

236
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:10,280
I combine this column and
this column to get this guy.

237
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,360
That was the b.

238
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,680
That's the zero three.

239
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,540
Okay.

240
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,790
So that idea of linear
combination is crucial,

241
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,130
and also --

242
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,915
do we want to think
about this question?

243
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,470
Sure, why not.

244
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,830
What are all the combinations?

245
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,655
If I took -- can I
go back to xs and ys?

246
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,610
This is a question for really --

247
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,450
it's going to come
up over and over,

248
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,350
but why don't we
see it once now?

249
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,610
If I took all the xs and all
the ys, all the combinations,

250
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,830
what would be all the results?

251
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,200
And, actually, the
result would be

252
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,400
that I could get any
right-hand side at all.

253
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,680
The combinations
of this and this

254
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,250
would fill the whole plane.

255
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,510
You can tuck that away.

256
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:14,080
We'll, explore it further.

257
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,610
But this idea of what linear
combination gives b and what do

258
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,650
all the linear
combinations give,

259
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,070
what are all the possible,
achievable right-hand sides be

260
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,610
-- that's going to be basic.

261
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,220
Okay.

262
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,980
Can I move to three
equations and three unknowns?

263
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:38,610
Because it's easy to
picture the two by two case.

264
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,980
Let me do a three
by three example.

265
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,330
Okay, I'll sort of
start it the same way,

266
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:50,210
say maybe 2x-y and maybe I'll
take no zs as a zero and maybe

267
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:55,940
a -x 2y and maybe
a -z as a -- oh,

268
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,130
let me make that a minus one
and, just for variety let me

269
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:09,930
take, -3z, -3ys, I should
keep the ys in that line,

270
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:14,400
and 4zs is, say, 4.

271
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,480
Okay.

272
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,100
That's three equations.

273
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,380
I'm in three
dimensions, x, y, z.

274
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,210
And, I don't have
a solution yet.

275
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:32,230
So I want to understand the
equations and then solve them.

276
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,780
Okay.

277
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,450
So how do I you understand them?

278
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,350
The row picture one way.

279
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,120
The column picture is
another very important way.

280
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,720
Just let's remember
the matrix form, here,

281
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,020
because that's easy.

282
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,140
The matrix form --
what's our matrix A?

283
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,280
Our matrix A is this right-hand
side, the two and the minus one

284
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,620
and the zero from the first
row, the minus one and the two

285
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,780
and the minus one
from the second row,

286
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:08,530
the zero, the minus three and
the four from the third row.

287
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,050
So it's a three by three matrix.

288
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,970
Three equations, three unknowns.

289
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,680
And what's our right-hand side?

290
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,190
Of course, it's the vector,
zero minus one, four.

291
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,180
Okay.

292
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:26,950
So that's the way, well, that's
the short-hand to write out

293
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,690
the three equations.

294
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,429
But it's the picture that
I'm looking for today.

295
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:32,470
Okay, so the row picture.

296
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:38,370
All right, so I'm in
three dimensions, x,

297
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,680
find out when there
isn't a solution.

298
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,950
y and z.

299
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:51,150
And I want to take those
equations one at a time and ask

300
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,820
--

301
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,280
and make a picture of all
the points that satisfy --

302
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,960
let's take equation number two.

303
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,820
If I make a picture of all
the points that satisfy --

304
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,900
all the x, y, z points
that solve this equation --

305
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,550
well, first of all, the
origin is not one of them.

306
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,620
x, y, z -- it being 0, 0, 0
would not solve that equation.

307
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,790
So what are some points
that do solve the equation?

308
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:23,750
Let's see, maybe if x is
one, y and z could be zero.

309
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,750
That would work, right?

310
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,870
So there's one point.

311
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,520
I'm looking at this
second equation,

312
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,120
here, just, to start with.

313
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,670
Let's see.

314
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,430
Also, I guess, if
z could be one,

315
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,710
x and y could be zero,
so that would just

316
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,930
go straight up that axis.

317
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,880
And, probably I'd want
a third point here.

318
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:55,390
Let me take x to be
zero, z to be zero,

319
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,400
then y would be
minus a half, right?

320
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,120
So there's a third point,
somewhere -- oh my -- okay.

321
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,900
Let's see.

322
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:13,080
I want to put in all the points
that satisfy that equation.

323
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,930
Do you know what that
bunch of points will be?

324
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,350
It's a plane.

325
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,430
If we have a linear
equation, then, fortunately,

326
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,070
the graph of the thing, the plot
of all the points that solve it

327
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,390
are a plane.

328
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,220
These three points
determine a plane,

329
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,570
but your lecturer
is not Rembrandt

330
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:43,380
and the art is going to
be the weak point here.

331
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,460
So I'm just going to
draw a plane, right?

332
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,310
There's a plane somewhere.

333
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,800
That's my plane.

334
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,960
That plane is all the
points that solves this guy.

335
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,880
Then, what about this one?

336
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,760
Two x minus y plus zero z.

337
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,410
So z actually can be anything.

338
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,390
Again, it's going
to be another plane.

339
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,290
Each row in a three
by three problem

340
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,480
gives us a plane in
three dimensions.

341
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,730
So this one is going to
be some other plane --

342
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,250
maybe I'll try to
draw it like this.

343
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:25,240
And those two planes
meet in a line.

344
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,280
So if I have two equations,
just the first two

345
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,380
equations in three dimensions,
those give me a line.

346
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,290
The line where those
two planes meet.

347
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:42,210
And now, the third
guy is a third plane.

348
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:49,290
And it goes somewhere.

349
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,820
Okay, those three
things meet in a point.

350
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,090
Now I don't know where
that point is, frankly.

351
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,140
But -- linear
algebra will find it.

352
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:05,580
The main point is that the three
planes, because they're not

353
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,100
parallel, they're not special.

354
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,780
They do meet in one point
and that's the solution.

355
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:16,910
But, maybe you can see
that this row picture is

356
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,120
getting a little hard to see.

357
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,520
The row picture was a cinch
when we looked at two lines

358
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,220
meeting.

359
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,740
When we look at
three planes meeting,

360
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:32,890
it's not so clear and in
four dimensions probably

361
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,780
a little less clear.

362
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,530
So, can I quit on
the row picture?

363
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,870
Or quit on the row picture
before I've successfully

364
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:45,940
found the point where
the three planes meet?

365
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:51,510
All I really want to see is
that the row picture consists

366
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,780
of three planes and, if
everything works right,

367
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,340
three planes meet in one
point and that's a solution.

368
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,730
Now, you can tell I
prefer the column picture.

369
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,990
Okay, so let me take
the column picture.

370
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,820
That's x times --

371
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,400
so there were two xs in the
first equation minus one x is,

372
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,690
and no xs in the third.

373
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,000
It's just the first
column of that.

374
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,300
And how many ys are there?

375
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,730
There's minus one in the first
equations, two in the second

376
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,430
and maybe minus
three in the third.

377
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,830
Just the second
column of my matrix.

378
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:37,740
And z times no zs minus
one zs and four zs.

379
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,270
And it's those three
columns, right,

380
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:46,640
that I have to combine to
produce the right-hand side,

381
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,945
which is zero minus one four.

382
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,910
Okay.

383
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,940
So what have we got on
this left-hand side?

384
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,470
A linear combination.

385
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,540
It's a linear combination
now of three vectors,

386
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,720
and they happen to be -- each
one is a three dimensional

387
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,000
vector, so we want to know
what combination of those three

388
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,090
vectors produces that one.

389
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,820
Shall I try to draw the
column picture, then?

390
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,830
So, since these vectors
have three components --

391
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,660
so it's some multiple -- let
me draw in the first column

392
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,340
as before --

393
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:27,287
x is two and y is minus one.

394
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:28,620
Maybe there is the first column.

395
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,570
y -- the second column has maybe
a minus one and a two and the y

396
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:44,180
is a minus three, somewhere,
there possibly, column two.

397
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,950
And the third column has --

398
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:52,760
no zero minus one four,
so how shall I draw that?

399
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,000
So this was the first component.

400
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,230
The second component
was a minus one.

401
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,270
Maybe up here.

402
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:08,921
That's column three, that's the
column zero minus one and four.

403
00:24:08,921 --> 00:24:09,420
This guy.

404
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,430
So, again, what's my problem?

405
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,260
What this equation
is asking me to do

406
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,340
is to combine
these three vectors

407
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:27,900
with a right combination
to produce this one.

408
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,620
Well, you can see what the
right combination is, because

409
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,250
in this special problem,
specially chosen

410
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,780
by the lecturer, that right-hand
side that I'm trying to get

411
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,060
is actually one
of these columns.

412
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,660
So I know how to get that one.

413
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,420
So what's the solution?

414
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,910
What combination will work?

415
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,940
I just want one of
these and none of these.

416
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:59,070
So x should be zero, y
should be zero and z should

417
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,040
be one.

418
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,520
That's the combination.

419
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,600
One of those is
obviously the right one.

420
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,870
Column three is
actually the same

421
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,090
as b in this particular problem.

422
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,860
I made it work
that way just so we

423
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,770
would get an answer,
(0,0,1), so somehow that's

424
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,890
the point where those
three planes met

425
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,710
and I couldn't see it before.

426
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,830
Of course, I won't always be
able to see it from the column

427
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,170
picture, either.

428
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:39,390
It's the next lecture, actually,
which is about elimination,

429
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:46,670
which is the systematic
way that everybody --

430
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:51,950
every bit of software, too --

431
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,830
production, large-scale software
would solve the equations.

432
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,020
So the lecture that's coming up.

433
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,450
If I was to add that
to the syllabus,

434
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:09,050
will be about how to find
x, y, z in all cases.

435
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:15,110
Can I just think again,
though, about the big picture?

436
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,910
By the big picture I mean
let's keep this same matrix

437
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,990
on the left but
imagine that we have

438
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,250
a different right-hand side.

439
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,430
Oh, let me take a
different right-hand side.

440
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,100
So I'll change that
right-hand side

441
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,610
to something that actually
is also pretty special.

442
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,810
Let me change it to --

443
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,940
if I add those
first two columns,

444
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,220
that would give me a one
and a one and a minus three.

445
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,210
There's a very special
right-hand side.

446
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:51,420
I just cooked it up by
adding this one to this one.

447
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,640
Now, what's the solution with
this new right-hand side?

448
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,960
The solution with this new
right-hand side is clear.

449
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,880
took one of these
and none of those.

450
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,030
So actually, it just
changed around to this

451
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,150
when I took this
new right-hand side.

452
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,010
Okay.

453
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:19,070
So in the row picture, I
have three different planes,

454
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,800
three new planes meeting
now at this point.

455
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,000
In the column picture, I
have the same three columns,

456
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,640
but now I'm combining
them to produce this guy,

457
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,100
and it turned out that column
one plus column two which would

458
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,500
be somewhere -- there
is the right column --

459
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,260
one of this and one of this
would give me the new b.

460
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,690
Okay.

461
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,730
So we squeezed in
an extra example.

462
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:55,970
But now think about all
bs, all right-hand sides.

463
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,920
Can I solve these equations
for every right-hand side?

464
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,980
Can I ask that question?

465
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,020
So that's the algebra question.

466
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,870
Can I solve A x=b for every b?

467
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,490
Let me write that down.

468
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:24,320
Can I solve A x =b for
every right-hand side b?

469
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,420
I mean, is there a solution?

470
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,670
And then, if there
is, elimination

471
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,940
will give me a way to find it.

472
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,520
I really wanted to ask,
is there a solution

473
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,850
for every right-hand side?

474
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,390
So now, can I put that
in different words --

475
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,140
in this linear
combination words?

476
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:52,510
So in linear combination words,
do the linear combinations

477
00:28:52,510 --> 00:29:03,060
of the columns fill
three dimensional space?

478
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:12,500
Every b means all the bs
in three dimensional space.

479
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,050
Do you see that I'm just
asking the same question

480
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,600
in different words?

481
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,040
Solving A x --

482
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,020
A x -- that's very important.

483
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:31,790
A times x -- when I multiply
a matrix by a vector,

484
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,940
I get a combination
of the columns.

485
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,650
I'll write that
down in a moment.

486
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:43,550
But in my column picture,
that's really what I'm doing.

487
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,080
I'm taking linear combinations
of these three columns

488
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,620
and I'm trying to find b.

489
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:57,750
And, actually, the answer
for this matrix will be yes.

490
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:04,330
For this matrix A -- for these
columns, the answer is yes.

491
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:19,590
This matrix -- that I chose for
an example is a good matrix.

492
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,780
A non-singular matrix.

493
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,180
An invertible matrix.

494
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,700
Those will be the matrices
that we like best.

495
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,490
There could be other --

496
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:35,070
and we will see other matrices
where the answer becomes, no --

497
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,320
oh, actually, you can see
when it would become no.

498
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,890
What could go wrong? find out
-- because if elimination fails,

499
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,820
How could it go wrong
that out of these --

500
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,310
out of three columns and
all their combinations --

501
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:58,390
when would I not be able
to produce some b off here?

502
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,610
When could it go wrong?

503
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,350
Do you see that
the combinations --

504
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,370
let me say when it goes wrong.

505
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:12,310
If these three columns
all lie in the same plane,

506
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:18,110
then their combinations
will lie in that same plane.

507
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,640
So then we're in trouble.

508
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,880
If the three columns
of my matrix --

509
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,180
if those three vectors happen
to lie in the same plane --

510
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,090
for example, if
column three is just

511
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:36,360
the sum of column one and column
two, I would be in trouble.

512
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,060
That would be a matrix A
where the answer would be no,

513
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,360
because the combinations --

514
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,260
if column three is in the same
plane as column one and two,

515
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,250
I don't get anything
new from that.

516
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,610
All the combinations are in the
plane and only right-hand sides

517
00:31:54,610 --> 00:32:00,010
b that I could get would
be the ones in that plane.

518
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,680
So I could solve it for
some right-hand sides, when

519
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,320
b is in the plane, but
most right-hand sides

520
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,270
would be out of the
plane and unreachable.

521
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,190
So that would be
a singular case.

522
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,830
The matrix would
be not invertible.

523
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,810
There would not be a
solution for every b.

524
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,511
The answer would
become no for that.

525
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:23,010
Okay.

526
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,040
I don't know --

527
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,190
shall we take just a
little shot at thinking

528
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,510
about nine dimensions?

529
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,645
Imagine that we have vectors
with nine components.

530
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,920
Well, it's going to be
hard to visualize those.

531
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,800
I don't pretend to do it.

532
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,950
But somehow, pretend you do.

533
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,610
Pretend we have -- if this
was nine equations and nine

534
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:59,260
unknowns, then we would
have nine columns,

535
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,720
and each one would be a vector
in nine-dimensional space

536
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,930
and we would be looking at
their linear combinations.

537
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,340
So we would be having
the linear combinations

538
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,320
of nine vectors in
nine-dimensional space,

539
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,380
and we would be trying to
find the combination that hit

540
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,000
the correct right-hand side b.

541
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,990
And we might also ask the
question can we always do it?

542
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,380
Can we get every
right-hand side b?

543
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,840
And certainly it will depend
on those nine columns.

544
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,480
Sometimes the answer
will be yes --

545
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,500
if I picked a random matrix,
it would be yes, actually.

546
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,630
If I used MatLab and just used
the random command, picked

547
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:44,820
out a nine by nine matrix,
I guarantee it would be

548
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,320
good.

549
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,140
It would be
non-singular, it would

550
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,270
be invertible, all beautiful.

551
00:33:49,270 --> 00:34:00,750
But if I choose those columns
so that they're not independent,

552
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:05,790
so that the ninth column is
the same as the eighth column,

553
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,020
then it contributes
nothing new and there

554
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,080
would be right-hand sides
b that I couldn't get.

555
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,210
Can you sort of think
about nine vectors

556
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:22,050
in nine-dimensional space
an take their combinations?

557
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,460
That's really the
central thought --

558
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,920
that you get kind of used
to in linear algebra.

559
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,340
Even though you can't
really visualize it,

560
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,139
you sort of think you
can after a while.

561
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:40,830
Those nine columns and
all their combinations

562
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:45,030
may very well fill out the
whole nine-dimensional space.

563
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,239
But if the ninth column happened
to be the same as the eighth

564
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,090
column and gave nothing new,
then probably what it would

565
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,102
fill out would be --

566
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:03,070
I hesitate even to say this --
it would be a sort of a plane

567
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,320
--

568
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,030
an eight dimensional plane
inside nine-dimensional space.

569
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,890
And it's those eight
dimensional planes

570
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,040
inside nine-dimensional
space that we

571
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,830
have to work with eventually.

572
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:25,970
For now, let's stay with a nice
case where the matrices work,

573
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,980
we can get every
right-hand side b and here

574
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,350
we see how to do
it with columns.

575
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,160
Okay.

576
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,520
There was one step
which I realized

577
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,210
I was saying in words that I
now want to write in letters.

578
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,750
Because I'm coming back to the
matrix form of the equation,

579
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,210
so let me write it here.

580
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:54,270
The matrix form of my
equation, of my system

581
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:57,970
is some matrix A
times some vector x

582
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,920
equals some right-hand side b.

583
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,950
Okay.

584
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,450
So this is a multiplication.

585
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,520
A times x.

586
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,430
Matrix times vector,
and I just want to say

587
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:11,620
how do you multiply
a matrix by a vector?

588
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:16,550
Okay, so I'm just going
to create a matrix --

589
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:21,640
let me take two
five one three --

590
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:28,140
and let me take a vector
x to be, say, 1and 2.

591
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,500
How do I multiply a
matrix by a vector?

592
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:40,530
But just think a little
bit about matrix notation

593
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,120
and how to do that
in multiplication.

594
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,390
So let me say how I multiply
a matrix by a vector.

595
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,760
Actually, there are
two ways to do it.

596
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,430
Let me tell you my favorite way.

597
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,770
It's columns again.

598
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,720
It's a column at a time.

599
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,980
For me, this matrix
multiplication

600
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,290
says I take one of that column
and two of that column and add.

601
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,770
So this is the way
I would think of it

602
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:12,820
is one of the first column
and two of the second column

603
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:17,300
and let's just see what we get.

604
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,510
So in the first component
I'm getting a two and a ten.

605
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,470
I'm getting a twelve there.

606
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,220
In the second component I'm
getting a one and a six,

607
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,860
I'm getting a seven.

608
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:35,460
So that matrix times that
vector is twelve seven.

609
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,207
Now, you could do
that another way.

610
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:40,540
You could do it a row at a time.

611
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,760
And you would get this twelve --
and actually I pretty much did

612
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,970
it here --

613
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:45,710
this way.

614
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,470
Two -- I could take that
row times my vector.

615
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:53,180
This is the idea
of a dot product.

616
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:58,140
This vector times this vector,
two times one plus five times

617
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,720
two is the twelve.

618
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,610
This vector times this vector --
one times one plus three times

619
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,000
two is the seven.

620
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,810
So I can do it by rows,
and in each row times

621
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:16,360
my x is what I'll later
call a dot product.

622
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,430
But I also like to
see it by columns.

623
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,490
I see this as a linear
combination of a column.

624
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,130
So here's my point.

625
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:36,180
A times x is a combination
of the columns of A.

626
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:43,650
That's how I hope you will
think of A times x when we need

627
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,150
it.

628
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,230
Right now we've got
-- with small ones,

629
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,390
we can always do it in
different ways, but later,

630
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,930
think of it that way.

631
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:54,480
Okay.

632
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:02,020
So that's the picture
for a two by two system.

633
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,970
And if the right-hand side B
happened to be twelve seven,

634
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:12,110
then of course the correct
solution would be one two.

635
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,610
Okay.

636
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:17,950
So let me come back next
time to a systematic way,

637
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:23,470
using elimination,
to find the solution,

638
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:29,810
if there is one, to a
system of any size and
