1
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,620
Okay.

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,290
This is lecture five
in linear algebra.

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,015
And, it will complete
this chapter of the book.

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,030
So the last section
of this chapter

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:30,060
is two point seven that talks
about permutations, which

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,240
finished the previous
lecture, and transposes,

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,650
which also came in
the previous lecture.

8
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,750
There's a little more to do
with those guys, permutations

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,860
and transposes.

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,180
But then the heart of the
lecture will be the beginning

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,910
of what you could say is the
beginning of linear algebra,

12
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,470
the beginning of real linear
algebra which is seeing

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,590
a bigger picture with vector
spaces -- not just vectors,

14
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,650
but spaces of vectors and
sub-spaces of those spaces.

15
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,110
So we're a little ahead
of the syllabus, which

16
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,150
is good, because we're
coming to the place

17
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,780
where, there's a lot to

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,620
do.

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,800
Okay.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,400
So, to begin with permutations.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,790
Can I just --

22
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:36,850
so these permutations, those
are matrices P and they execute

23
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,400
row exchanges.

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,910
And we may need them.

25
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,120
We may have a
perfectly good matrix,

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,310
a perfect matrix A that's
invertible that we can solve A

27
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,580
x=b, but to do it --

28
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,050
I've got to allow myself
that extra freedom

29
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:05,070
that if a zero shows up in the
pivot position I move it away.

30
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,630
I get a non-zero.

31
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,460
I get a proper pivot there by
exchanging from a row below.

32
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,000
And you've seen that
already, and I just

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,200
want to collect
the ideas together.

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,310
And principle, I
could even have to do

35
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,750
that two times, or more times.

36
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,290
So I have to allow --

37
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,330
to complete the --

38
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:34,370
the theory, the possibility
that I take my matrix A,

39
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,540
I start elimination, I find
out that I need row exchanges

40
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,620
and I do it and
continue and I finish.

41
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,750
Okay.

42
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:49,150
Then all I want to do is say --
and I won't make a big project

43
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,160
out of this --

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,300
what happens to A equal L U?

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,570
So A equal L U --

46
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:05,130
this was a matrix L with ones
on the diagonal and zeroes

47
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,450
above and multipliers
below, and this U

48
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,425
we know, with zeroes down here.

49
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,080
That's only possible.

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,770
That description of
elimination assumes

51
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,480
that we don't have a P, that we
don't have any row exchanges.

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,570
And now I just want
to say, okay, how

53
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,220
do I account for row exchanges?

54
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,990
Because that doesn't.

55
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:40,030
The P in this factorization
is the identity matrix.

56
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,140
The rows were in a good
order, we left them there.

57
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,830
Maybe I'll just add a
little moment of reality,

58
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:55,190
too, about how Matlab
actually does elimination.

59
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,520
Matlab not only checks whether
that pivot is not zero,

60
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,770
as every human would do.

61
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,480
It checks for is that
pivot big enough,

62
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,380
because it doesn't like
very, very small pivots.

63
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,550
Pivots close to zero
are numerically bad.

64
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,660
So actually if we ask
Matlab to solve a system,

65
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,420
it will do some elimination
some row exchanges, which

66
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,180
we don't think are necessary.

67
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,930
Algebra doesn't say they're
necessary, but accuracy --

68
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,680
numerical accuracy
says they are.

69
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,930
Well, we're doing
algebra, so here we

70
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,380
will say, well, what
do row exchanges do,

71
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,230
but we won't do them
unless we have to.

72
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,340
But we may have to.

73
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,380
And then, the result is --

74
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,850
it's hiding here.

75
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,040
It's the main fact.

76
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,100
This is the description of
elimination with row exchanges.

77
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:12,280
So A equal L U
becomes P A equal L U.

78
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,210
So this P is the matrix
that does the row exchanges,

79
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,080
and actually it does them --

80
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,780
it gets the rows
into the right order,

81
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,810
into the good order
where pivots will not --

82
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,120
where zeroes won't appear
in the pivot position,

83
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,700
where L and U will come
out right as up here.

84
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,430
So, that's the point.

85
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,650
Actually, I don't want
to labor that point,

86
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,110
that a permutation matrix --

87
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,260
and you remember
what those were.

88
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,280
I'll remind you from last time
of what the main points about

89
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,820
permutation matrices were --

90
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,340
and then just leave
this factorization

91
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,820
as the general case.

92
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:17,220
This is -- any
invertible A we get this.

93
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,090
For almost every one,
we don't need a P.

94
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,220
But there's that handful
that do need row exchanges,

95
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,480
and if we do need
them, there they are.

96
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,410
Okay, finally, just to
remember what P was.

97
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:46,440
So permutations, P is
the identity matrix

98
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,480
with reordered rows.

99
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,707
I include in reordering the
possibility that you just

100
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:00,540
leave them the same.

101
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,880
So the identity
matrix is -- okay.

102
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,490
That's, like, your basic
permutation matrix --

103
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,840
your do-nothing permutation
matrix is the identity.

104
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,730
And then there are the ones
that exchange two rows and then

105
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,940
the ones that exchange three
rows and then then ones that

106
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,040
exchange four --

107
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,640
well, it gets a little --

108
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,310
it gets more interesting
algebraically

109
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,630
if you've got four rows,
you might exchange them

110
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,190
all in one big cycle.

111
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,550
One to two, two to three,
three to four, four to one.

112
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:41,070
Or you might have -- exchange
one and two and three and four.

113
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,467
Lots of possibilities there.

114
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:43,800
In fact, how many possibilities?

115
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,310
The answer was (n)factorial.

116
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,984
This is n(n-1)(n-2)...

117
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,230
(3)(2)(1).

118
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:05,100
That's the number of --
this counts the reorderings,

119
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,990
the possible reorderings.

120
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:15,730
So it counts all the
n by n permutations.

121
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,200
And all those
matrices have these --

122
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:32,380
have this nice property
that they're all invertible,

123
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:39,140
because we can bring those rows
back into the normal order.

124
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,679
And the matrix that
does that is just P --

125
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,590
is just the same
as the transpose.

126
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,180
You might take a
permutation matrix,

127
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,820
multiply by its transpose
and you will see how --

128
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,220
that the ones hit the ones and
give the ones in the identity

129
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,010
matrix.

130
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,980
So this is a --

131
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,590
we'll be highly
interested in matrices

132
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,980
that have nice properties.

133
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,580
And one property that -- maybe
I could rewrite that as P

134
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,880
transpose P is the identity.

135
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,950
That tells me in
other words that this

136
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,300
is the inverse of that.

137
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,210
Okay.

138
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:25,940
We'll be interested in
matrices that have P transpose

139
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,940
P equal the identity.

140
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,470
There are more of them
than just permutations,

141
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,000
but my point right now is that
permutations are like a little

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,870
group in the middle --

143
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,180
in the center of these
special matrices.

144
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,270
Okay.

145
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,590
So now we know how
many there are.

146
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,750
Twenty four in the case of
-- there are twenty four four

147
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,960
by four permutations, there
are five factorial which is

148
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,340
a hundred and twenty, five times
twenty four would bump us up

149
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,710
to a hundred and twenty -- so
listing all the five by five

150
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:09,990
permutations would
be not so much fun.

151
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,380
Okay.

152
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,320
So that's permutations.

153
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,960
Now also in section two seven is
some discussion of transposes.

154
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,895
And can I just complete
that discussion.

155
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,910
First of all, I haven't
even transposed a matrix

156
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,110
on the board here, have I?

157
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,710
So I'd better do it.

158
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:39,975
So suppose I take a matrix
like (1 2 4; 3 3 1).

159
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,640
It's a rectangular
matrix, three by two.

160
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,030
And I want to transpose it.

161
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,380
So what's --

162
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:59,040
I'll use a T, also
Matlab would use a prime.

163
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,050
And the result will be --

164
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,770
I'll right it here, because this
was three rows and two columns,

165
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,060
this was a three by two matrix.

166
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,080
The transpose will be two
rows and three columns,

167
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,380
two by three.

168
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,180
So it's short and wider.

169
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,730
And, of course, that row --
that column becomes a row --

170
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,510
that column becomes
the other row.

171
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:36,200
And at the same time,
that row became a column.

172
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,970
This row became a column.

173
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,610
Oh, what's the general
formula for the transpose?

174
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:48,920
So the transpose --

175
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,740
you see it in numbers.

176
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,570
What I'm going to write is
the same thing in symbols.

177
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,920
The numbers are the
clearest, of course.

178
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,170
But in symbols, if
I take A transpose

179
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:10,135
and I ask what number is in row
I and column J of A transpose?

180
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,320
Well, it came out of A.

181
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,080
It came out A by this flip
across the main diagonal.

182
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:28,030
And, actually, it
was the number in A

183
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:34,540
which was in row J, column I.

184
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,920
So the row and column --

185
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,880
the row and column
numbers just get reversed.

186
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,030
The row number becomes
the column number,

187
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,450
the column number
becomes the row number.

188
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,610
No problem.

189
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,260
Okay.

190
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,280
Now, a special --

191
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,880
the best matrices, we could say.

192
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,590
In a lot of applications,
symmetric matrices show up.

193
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:02,145
So can I just call attention
to symmetric matrices?

194
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,840
What does that mean?

195
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,110
What does that word
symmetric mean?

196
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,000
It means that this transposing
doesn't change the matrix.

197
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,690
A transpose equals A.

198
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,255
And an example.

199
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,900
So, let's take a matrix
that's symmetric,

200
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,750
so whatever is sitting
on the diagonal --

201
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,800
but now what's above the
diagonal, like a one,

202
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,630
had better be there, a
seven had better be here,

203
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,410
a nine had better be there.

204
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,460
There's a symmetric matrix.

205
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,420
I happened to use all positive
numbers as its entries.

206
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,030
That's not the point.

207
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,160
The point is that if I
transpose that matrix,

208
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,880
I get it back again.

209
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,370
So symmetric matrices have this
property A transpose equals A.

210
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,150
I guess at this point --

211
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:14,130
I'm just asking you to notice
this family of matrices that

212
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,830
are unchanged by transposing.

213
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:22,950
And they're easy to
identify, of course.

214
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:28,060
You know, it's not maybe so
easy before we had a case where

215
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,830
the transpose gave the inverse.

216
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,230
That's highly important,
but not so simple to see.

217
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,200
This is the case where the
transpose gives the same matrix

218
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,720
back again.

219
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,510
That's totally simple to see.

220
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,380
Okay.

221
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,410
Could actually -- maybe I could
even say when would we get such

222
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,150
a matrix?

223
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,740
For example, this -- that
matrix is absolutely far from

224
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,850
symmetric, right?

225
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,150
The transpose isn't
even the same shape --

226
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,700
because it's rectangular,
it turns the --

227
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,580
lies down on its side.

228
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,970
But let me tell you a way to
get a symmetric matrix out of

229
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,880
this.

230
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,640
Multiply those together.

231
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,210
If I multiply this
rectangular, shall I

232
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,910
call it R for rectangular?

233
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,890
So let that be R for
rectangular matrix

234
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:27,580
and let that be R
transpose, which it is.

235
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,000
Then I think that if I
multiply those together,

236
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,390
I get a symmetric matrix.

237
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,780
Can I just do it
with the numbers

238
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:44,700
and then ask you why, how did
I know it would be symmetric?

239
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:52,415
So my point is that R transpose
R is always symmetric.

240
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:52,914
Okay?

241
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,470
And I'm going to do it for that
particular R transpose R which

242
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,750
was --

243
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,815
let's see, the column was
one two four three three one.

244
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
I called that one R
transpose, didn't I,

245
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,030
and I called this guy one
two four three three one.

246
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,550
I called that R.

247
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,970
Shall we just do
that multiplication?

248
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,960
Okay, so up here
I'm getting a ten.

249
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,310
Next to it I'm getting two, a
nine, I'm getting an eleven.

250
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,390
Next to that I'm getting
four and three, a seven.

251
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,650
Now what do I get there?

252
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:37,650
This eleven came from one
three times two three, right?

253
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,720
Row one, column two.

254
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,530
What goes here?

255
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,360
Row two, column one.

256
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,050
But no difference.

257
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,220
One three two three or two
three one three, same thing.

258
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,750
It's going to be an eleven.

259
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,310
That's the symmetry.

260
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,230
I can continue to fill it out.

261
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,100
What -- oh, let's
get that seven.

262
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,520
That seven will show
up down here, too,

263
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,650
and then four more numbers.

264
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,619
That seven will show up here
because one three times four

265
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:10,630
one gave the seven, but also
four one times one three

266
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,599
will give that seven.

267
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,030
Do you see that it works?

268
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:24,630
Actually, do you want to see it
work also in matrix language?

269
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,089
I mean, that's quite
convincing, right?

270
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,965
That seven is no accident.

271
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,550
The eleven is no accident.

272
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:40,680
But just tell me how do I know
if I transpose this guy --

273
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,820
How do I know it's symmetric?

274
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,620
Well, I'm going to transpose it.

275
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,610
And when I transpose
it, I'm hoping

276
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,210
I get the matrix back again.

277
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,630
So can I transpose
R transpose R?

278
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,157
So just -- so, why?

279
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,945
Well, my suggestion
is take the transpose.

280
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,670
That's the only way to
show it's symmetric.

281
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,340
Take the transpose and
see that it didn't change.

282
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,970
Okay, so I take the
transpose of R transpose R.

283
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,470
Okay.

284
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,190
How do I do that?

285
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,680
This is our little practice
on the rules for transposes.

286
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,780
So the rule for transposes
is the order gets reversed.

287
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,300
Just like inverses,
which we did prove,

288
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:44,390
same rule for transposes
and -- which we'll now use.

289
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,110
So the order gets reversed.

290
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,600
It's the transpose of
that that comes first,

291
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,880
and the transpose of
this that comes -- no.

292
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,010
Is that -- yeah.

293
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,130
That's what I have
to write, right?

294
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,500
This is a product of two
matrices and I want its

295
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,350
transpose.

296
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,880
So I put the matrices
in the opposite order

297
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,480
and I transpose them.

298
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,780
But what have I got here?

299
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,320
What is R transpose transpose?

300
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,670
Well, don't all speak at once.

301
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,080
R transpose transpose, I
flipped over the diagonal,

302
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,540
I flipped over the diagonal
again, so I've got R.

303
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,770
And that's just my point, that
if I started with this matrix,

304
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,740
I transposed it, I
got it back again.

305
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:46,810
So that's the check, without
using numbers, but with --

306
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:52,510
it checked in two lines that I
always get symmetric matrices

307
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,480
this way.

308
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,680
And actually, that's
where they come

309
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,220
from in so many
practical applications.

310
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,730
Okay.

311
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:07,580
So now I've said something today
about permutations and about

312
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:14,540
transposes and about
symmetry and I'm ready

313
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,290
for chapter three.

314
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:21,550
Can we take a breath --

315
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,250
the tape won't take a breath,
but the lecturer will,

316
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:31,980
because to tell you
about vector spaces is --

317
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:38,220
we really have to start now
and think, okay, listen up.

318
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,500
What are vector spaces?

319
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
And what are sub-spaces?

320
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,890
Okay.

321
00:20:51,890 --> 00:21:01,430
So, the point is, The main
operations that we do --

322
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,450
what do we do with vectors?

323
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,820
We add them.

324
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,270
We know how to add two vectors.

325
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,930
We multiply them by numbers,
usually called scalers.

326
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,350
If we have a vector, we
know what three V is.

327
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:24,030
If we have a vector V and
W, we know what V plus W is.

328
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,670
Those are the two
operations that we've

329
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,090
got to be able to do.

330
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:33,220
To legitimately talk
about a space of vectors,

331
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,870
the requirement
is that we should

332
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,990
be able to add the things
and multiply by numbers

333
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,380
and that there should be
some decent rules satisfied.

334
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,370
Okay.

335
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,590
So let me start with examples.

336
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,755
So I'm talking now
about vector spaces.

337
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,685
And I'm going to
start with examples.

338
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,480
Let me say again what this
word space is meaning.

339
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,010
When I say that word
space, that means to me

340
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:19,440
that I've got a bunch of
vectors, a space of vectors.

341
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,010
But not just any
bunch of vectors.

342
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,720
It has to be a
space of vectors --

343
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,300
has to allow me to do the
operations that vectors

344
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,740
are for.

345
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,110
I have to be able to add
vectors and multiply by numbers.

346
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,560
I have to be able to
take linear combinations.

347
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,120
Well, where did we meet
linear combinations?

348
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,960
We met them back in, say in R^2.

349
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,370
So there's a vector space.

350
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,010
What's that vector space?

351
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:59,270
So R two is telling me I'm
talking about real numbers

352
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,370
and I'm talking about
two real numbers.

353
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:11,470
So this is all two
dimensional vectors --

354
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:16,580
real, such as --

355
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,750
well, I'm not going to
be able to list them all.

356
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,210
But let me put a few down.

357
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:30,420
|3; 2|, |0;0|, |pi; e|.

358
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:30,920
So on.

359
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,890
And it's natural -- okay.

360
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,270
Let's see, I guess I
should do algebra first.

361
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,980
Algebra means what can
I do to these vectors?

362
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,130
I can add them.

363
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,520
I can add that to that.

364
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,660
And how do I do it?

365
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,460
A component at a
time, of course.

366
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,240
Three two added to zero
zero gives me, three two.

367
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,190
Sorry about that.

368
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:05,780
Three two added to pi e gives
me three plus pi, two plus e.

369
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,260
Oh, you know what it does.

370
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,240
And you know the picture
that goes with it.

371
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,830
There's the vector three two.

372
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,520
And often, the
picture has an arrow.

373
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,550
The vector zero zero, which is
a highly important vector --

374
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,610
it's got, like, the
most important here

375
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,930
-- is there.

376
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:29,840
And of course there's
not much of an arrow.

377
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,110
Pi -- I'll have to remember --
pi is about three and a little

378
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,570
more, e is about two
and a little more.

379
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,090
So maybe there's pi e.

380
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,690
I never drew pi e before.

381
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,030
It's just natural to --

382
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:55,560
this is the first
component on the horizontal

383
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,470
and this is the
second component,

384
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,010
going up the vertical.

385
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:02,910
Okay.

386
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:07,570
And the whole plane is R two.

387
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:14,980
So R two is, we
could say, the plane.

388
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,710
The xy plane.

389
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,920
That's what everybody thinks.

390
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:32,800
But the point is it's a vector
space because all those vectors

391
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,140
are in there.

392
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,380
If I removed one of them --

393
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,420
Suppose I removed zero zero.

394
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,480
Suppose I tried to take the --
considered the X Y plane with

395
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,360
a puncture, with
a point removed.

396
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,200
Like the origin.

397
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,470
That would be, like, awful
to take the origin away.

398
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,570
Why is that?

399
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,550
Why do I need the origin there?

400
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:59,570
Because I have to be allowed --
if I had these other vectors,

401
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,330
I have to be allowed to
multiply three two --

402
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,610
this was three two --

403
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,820
by anything, by any
scaler, including zero.

404
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,020
I've got to be allowed
to multiply by zero

405
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,010
and the result's
got to be there.

406
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,110
I can't do without that point.

407
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:23,670
And I have to be able to add
three two to the opposite guy,

408
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,800
minus three minus two.

409
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,230
And if I add those I'm
back to the origin again.

410
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,360
No way I can do
without the origin.

411
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,280
Every vector space has got
that zero vector in it.

412
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,650
Okay, that's an
easy vector space,

413
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,520
because we have a
natural picture of it.

414
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,840
Okay.

415
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,260
Similarly easy is R^3.

416
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,630
This would be all -- let
me go up a little here.

417
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,820
This would be --

418
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:02,670
R three would be all three
dimensional vectors --

419
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:09,645
or shall I say vectors
with three real components.

420
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,000
Okay.

421
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,030
Let me just to be
sure we're together,

422
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,661
let me take the
vector three two zero.

423
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:33,390
Is that a vector in R^2 or R^3?

424
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:38,490
Definitely it's in R^3.

425
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,150
It's got three components.

426
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,040
One of them happens to be zero,
but that's a perfectly okay

427
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,850
number.

428
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,290
So that's a vector in R^3.

429
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:51,590
We don't want to mix up the --

430
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,090
I mean, keep these vectors
straight and keep R^n straight.

431
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,630
So what's R^n?

432
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,150
R^n.

433
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:05,990
So this is our big example, is
all vectors with n components.

434
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:11,170
And I'm making these darn
things column vectors.

435
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,050
Can I try to follow
that convention,

436
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,530
that they'll be column vectors,
and their components should

437
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,690
be real numbers.

438
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:24,830
Later we'll need complex
numbers and complex vectors,

439
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,721
but much later.

440
00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:27,220
Okay.

441
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,780
So that's a vector space.

442
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,670
Now, let's see.

443
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,910
What do I have to tell
you about vector spaces?

444
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:44,090
I said the most important thing,
which is that we can add any

445
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,760
two of these and
we -- still in R^2.

446
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,220
We can multiply by any number
and we're still in R^2.

447
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,380
We can take any combination
and we're still in R^2.

448
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,290
And same goes for R^n.

449
00:28:55,290 --> 00:29:02,240
It's -- honesty requires me to
mention that these operations

450
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,300
of adding and multiplying
have to obey a few rules.

451
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,790
Like, we can't just arbitrarily
say, okay, the sum of three two

452
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,610
and pi e is zero zero.

453
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,410
It's not.

454
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,650
The sum of three two and
minus three two is zero zero.

455
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:27,030
So -- oh, I'm not going
to -- the book, actually,

456
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:32,420
lists the eight rules that the
addition and multiplication

457
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,680
have to satisfy, but they do.

458
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,810
They certainly satisfy it in
R^n and usually it's not those

459
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,170
eight rules that are in doubt.

460
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:50,070
What's -- the question is, can
we do those additions and do we

461
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,250
stay in the space?

462
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,580
Let me show you a
case where you can't.

463
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,810
So suppose this is going
to be not a vector space.

464
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,780
Suppose I take the xy
plane -- so there's R^2.

465
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,240
That is a vector space.

466
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,940
Now suppose I just
take part of it.

467
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,670
Just this.

468
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:22,270
Just this one -- this is one
quarter of the vector space.

469
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:29,965
All the vectors with positive
or at least not negative

470
00:30:29,965 --> 00:30:30,465
components.

471
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,540
Can I add those safely?

472
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,410
Yes.

473
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,690
If I add a vector
with, like, two --

474
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,030
three two to another
vector like five six,

475
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,950
I'm still up in this quarter,
no problem with adding.

476
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:54,860
But there's a heck of a problem
with multiplying by scalers,

477
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,690
because there's a lot of
scalers that will take me out

478
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,280
of this quarter plane,
like negative ones.

479
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,820
If I took three two and I
multiplied by minus five,

480
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,240
I'm way down here.

481
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,220
So that's not a vector
space, because it's not --

482
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,250
closed is the right word.

483
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,870
It's not closed
under multiplication

484
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,850
by all real numbers.

485
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,150
So a vector space has to be
closed under multiplication

486
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,010
and addition of vectors.

487
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,680
In other words,
linear combinations.

488
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:37,560
It -- so, it means that if
I give you a few vectors --

489
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,980
yeah look, here's an
important -- here --

490
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,420
now we're getting to some
really important vector spaces.

491
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:47,460
Well, R^n -- like, they
are the most important.

492
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:52,520
But we will be interested in
so- in vector spaces that are

493
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,700
inside R^n.

494
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:01,790
Vector spaces that follow
the rules, but they --

495
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:10,140
we don't need all of -- see,
there we started with R^2 here,

496
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,060
and took part of it
and messed it up.

497
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,420
What we got was
not a vector space.

498
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:25,670
Now tell me a vector space that
is part of R^2 and is still

499
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:31,480
safely -- we can multiply, we
can add and we stay in this

500
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,880
smaller vector space.

501
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,680
So it's going to be
called a subspace.

502
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,990
So I'm going to change this
bad example to a good one.

503
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,440
Okay.

504
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,620
So I'm going to
start again with R^2,

505
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:50,120
but I'm going to take an
example -- it is a vector space,

506
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,805
so it'll be a vector
space inside R^2.

507
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:03,560
And we'll call that
a subspace of R^2.

508
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,040
Okay.

509
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,010
What can I do?

510
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:11,960
It's got something in it.

511
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,730
Suppose it's got
this vector in it.

512
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,070
Okay.

513
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,740
If that vector's in
my little subspace

514
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,500
and it's a true
subspace, then there's

515
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,990
got to be some more in it,

516
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:25,640
right?

517
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,900
I have to be able to
multiply that by two,

518
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,660
and that double vector
has to be included.

519
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,610
Have to be able to multiply
by zero, that vector,

520
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,420
or by half, or by
three quarters.

521
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,310
All these vectors.

522
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:44,470
Or by minus a half,
or by minus one.

523
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,730
I have to be able to
multiply by any number.

524
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,250
So that is going to say that I
have to have that whole line.

525
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:56,410
Do you see that?

526
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,440
Once I get a vector in there --

527
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,070
I've got the whole line of
all multiples of that vector.

528
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:09,320
I can't have a vector space
without extending to get

529
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,770
those multiples in there.

530
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,399
Now I still have
to check addition.

531
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,179
But that comes out okay.

532
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,560
This line is going to work,
because I could add something

533
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,219
on the line to something
else on the line

534
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,540
and I'm still on the line.

535
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,469
So, example.

536
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:33,340
So this is all examples
of a subspace --

537
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:45,199
our example is a line in R^2
actually -- not just any line.

538
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:50,239
If I took this
line, would that --

539
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,960
so all the vectors on that line.

540
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,929
So that vector and that vector
and this vector and this vector

541
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,380
--

542
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:05,450
in lighter type, I'm drawing
something that doesn't work.

543
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,510
It's not a subspace.

544
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,890
The line in R^2 --
to be a subspace,

545
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:15,220
the line in R^2 must go
through the zero vector.

546
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,700
Because -- why is
this line no good?

547
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,140
Let me do a dashed line.

548
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,290
Because if I multiplied that
vector on the dashed line

549
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,490
by zero, then I'm down here,
I'm not on the dashed line.

550
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,620
Z- zero's got to be.

551
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,920
Every subspace has
got to contain zero --

552
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,230
because I must be allowed to
multiply by zero and that will

553
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,300
always give me the zero vector.

554
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,020
Okay.

555
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,410
Now, I was going to make --

556
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,460
create some subspaces.

557
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,610
Oh, while I'm in R^2,
why don't we think of all

558
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,110
the possibilities.

559
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,760
R two, there can't be that many.

560
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,510
So what are the possible
subspaces of R^2?

561
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,720
Let me list them.

562
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,220
So I'm listing now
the subspaces of R^2.

563
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:23,750
And one possibility
that we always allow

564
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:29,760
is all of R two, the whole
thing, the whole space.

565
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,010
That counts as a
subspace of itself.

566
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,830
You always want to allow that.

567
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:39,750
Then the others are lines --

568
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:45,690
any line, meaning infinitely
far in both directions

569
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,810
through the zero.

570
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,790
So that's like
the whole space --

571
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,550
that's like whole two D space.

572
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,860
This is like one dimension.

573
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,320
Is this line the same as R^1 ?

574
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,470
No.

575
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:11,200
You could say it
looks a lot like R^1.

576
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,380
R^1 was just a line
and this is a line.

577
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,460
But this is a line inside R^2.

578
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,440
The vectors here
have two components.

579
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,600
So that's not the same as R^1,
because there the vectors only

580
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,570
have one component.

581
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,590
Very close, you could
say, but not the same.

582
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,320
Okay.

583
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,250
And now there's a
third possibility.

584
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,940
There's a third
subspace that's --

585
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:47,970
of R^2 that's not the whole
thing, and it's not a line.

586
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,170
It's even less.

587
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,840
It's just the zero vector alone.

588
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,170
The zero vector alone, only.

589
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,550
I'll often call this
subspace Z, just for zero.

590
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,700
Here's a line, L.

591
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,010
Here's a plane, all of R^2.

592
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:14,680
So, do you see that
the zero vector's okay?

593
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,970
You would just -- to
understand subspaces,

594
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,820
we have to know the rules -- and
knowing the rules means that we

595
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,040
have to see that yes, the
zero vector by itself,

596
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,990
just this guy alone
satisfies the rules.

597
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,690
Why's that?

598
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,320
Oh, it's too dumb to tell you.

599
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,430
If I took that and added it
to itself, I'm still there.

600
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,320
If I took that and multiplied
by seventeen, I'm still there.

601
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,070
So I've done the operations,
adding and multiplying

602
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:47,010
by numbers, that are
required, and I didn't go

603
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,300
outside this one point space.

604
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:57,170
So that's always -- that's
the littlest subspace.

605
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:00,930
And the largest subspace is the
whole thing and in-between come

606
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,370
all --

607
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,080
whatever's in between.

608
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,580
Okay.

609
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,610
So for example, what's
in between for R^3?

610
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:12,100
So if I'm in ordinary three
dimensions, the subspace is R,

611
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:18,250
all of R^3 at one extreme,
the zero vector at the bottom.

612
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:23,430
And then a plane, a
plane through the origin.

613
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,510
Or a line, a line
through the origin.

614
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:32,970
So with R^3, the subspaces were
R^3, plane through the origin,

615
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:37,560
line through the origin and
a zero vector by itself,

616
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,030
zero zero zero, just
that single vector.

617
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,360
Okay, you've got the idea.

618
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,080
But, now comes --

619
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,350
the reality is --

620
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:57,530
what are these -- where
do these subspaces come --

621
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,950
how do they come
out of matrices?

622
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:06,080
And I want to take
this matrix --

623
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,350
oh, let me take that matrix.

624
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:17,430
So I want to create some
subspaces out of that matrix.

625
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:26,980
Well, one subspace
is from the columns.

626
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,760
Okay.

627
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,050
So this is the
important subspace,

628
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:38,190
the first important subspace
that comes from that matrix --

629
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,750
I'm going to -- let
me call it A again.

630
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,370
Back to -- okay.

631
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:48,150
I'm looking at the columns of A.

632
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,530
Those are vectors in R^3.

633
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,380
So the columns are in R^3.

634
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:58,100
The columns are in R^3.

635
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,585
So I want those columns
to be in my subspace.

636
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,960
Now I can't just put two
columns in my subspace

637
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,512
and call it a subspace.

638
00:41:14,512 --> 00:41:16,970
What do I have to throw in --
if I'm going to put those two

639
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,460
columns in, what else has got
to be there to have a subspace?

640
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:25,050
I must be able to
add those things.

641
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:28,460
So the sum of those columns --

642
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:34,970
so these columns are in R^3,
and I have to be able --

643
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,330
I'm, you know, I want
that to be in my subspace,

644
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,080
I want that to be
in my subspace,

645
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,880
but therefore I have to be able
to multiply them by anything.

646
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,910
Zero zero zero has got
to be in my subspace.

647
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,630
I have to be able to add
them so that four five five

648
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,150
is in the subspace.

649
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,054
I've got to be able to add one
of these plus three of these.

650
00:41:53,054 --> 00:41:54,470
That'll give me
some other vector.

651
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:02,180
I have to be able to take
all the linear combinations.

652
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:14,200
So these are columns in R^3 and
all there linear combinations

653
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,920
form a subspace.

654
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,400
What do I mean by
linear combinations?

655
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,060
I mean multiply
that by something,

656
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,290
multiply that by
something and add.

657
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:33,350
The two operations of linear
algebra, multiplying by numbers

658
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,060
and adding vectors.

659
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,930
And, if I include
all the results,

660
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,875
then I'm guaranteed
to have a subspace.

661
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,860
I've done the job.

662
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,210
And we'll give it a name --

663
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:49,960
the column space.

664
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,380
Column space.

665
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,920
And maybe I'll call it C of A.

666
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,120
C for column space.

667
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,020
There's an idea there that --

668
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:22,750
Like, the central idea
for today's lecture is --

669
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,220
got a few vectors.

670
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,130
Not satisfied with
a few vectors,

671
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,800
we want a space of vectors.

672
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,160
The vectors, they're in --
these vectors in -- are in R^3 ,

673
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,050
so our space of vectors
will be vectors in R^3.

674
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:40,940
The key idea's -- we
have to be able to take

675
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,400
their combinations.

676
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,300
So tell me, geometrically,
if I drew all these things --

677
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,060
like if I drew one two four,
that would be somewhere maybe

678
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:50,930
there.

679
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:54,740
If I drew three three one,
who knows, might be --

680
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,140
I don't know, I'll say there.

681
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:01,690
There's column one,
there's column two.

682
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,700
What else -- what's in
the whole column space?

683
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:11,160
How do I draw the
whole column space now?

684
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,430
I take all combinations
of those two vectors.

685
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:18,220
Do I get -- well, I
guess I actually listed

686
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,160
the possibilities.

687
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,940
Do I get the whole space?

688
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,190
Do I get a plane?

689
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,984
I get more than a
line, that's for sure.

690
00:44:26,984 --> 00:44:28,900
And I certainly get more
than the zero vector,

691
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,610
but I do get the
zero vector included.

692
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,160
What do I get if I combine --

693
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,115
take all the combinations
of two vectors in R^3 ?

694
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,450
So I've got all this stuff on --

695
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,040
that whole line gets filled
out, that whole line gets filled

696
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,190
out, but all in-between
gets filled out --

697
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,900
between the two
lines because I --

698
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,610
I allowed to add something
from one line, something

699
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,850
from the other.

700
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:58,810
You see what's coming?

701
00:44:58,810 --> 00:44:59,643
I'm getting a plane.

702
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,790
That's my -- and it's
through the origin.

703
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:17,950
Those two vectors, namely one
two four and three three one,

704
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,590
when I take all
their combinations,

705
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,770
I fill out a whole plane.

706
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:25,240
Please think about that.

707
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,280
That's the picture
you have to see.

708
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,940
You sure have to see it in R^3
, because we're going to do it

709
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:36,880
in R^10, and we may take a
combination of five vectors

710
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,740
in R^10, and what will we have?

711
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,630
God knows.

712
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:44,910
It's some subspace.

713
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,880
We'll have five vectors.

714
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,010
They'll all have ten components.

715
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:52,320
We take their combinations.

716
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:58,240
We don't have R^5 , because our
vectors have ten components.

717
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:05,020
And we possibly have, like,
some five dimensional flat thing

718
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,680
going through the
origin for sure.

719
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,110
Well, of course, if those five
vectors were all on the line,

720
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:13,710
then we would only
get that line.

721
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:16,840
So, you see, there are, like,
other possibilities here.

722
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,690
It depends what -- it depends
on those five vectors.

723
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:25,440
Just like if our two columns
had been on the same line,

724
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,640
then the column space would
have been only a line.

725
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,440
Here it was a plane.

726
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:31,940
Okay.

727
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,610
I'm going to stop at that point.

728
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:44,220
That's the central idea of
-- the great example of how

729
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,960
to create a subspace
from a matrix.

730
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,990
Take its columns, take
their combinations,

731
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:57,360
all their linear combinations
and you get the column space.

732
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,060
And that's the
central sort of --

733
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,320
we're looking at linear
algebra at a higher level.

734
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,600
When I look at A -- now,
I want to look at Ax=b.

735
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,090
That'll be the first
thing in the next lecture.

736
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:17,300
How do I understand
Ax=b in this language --

737
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:22,580
in this new language of vector
spaces and column spaces.

738
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,830
And what are other subspaces?

739
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:30,230
So the column space is a big
one, there are others to come.

740
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,270
Okay, thanks.
