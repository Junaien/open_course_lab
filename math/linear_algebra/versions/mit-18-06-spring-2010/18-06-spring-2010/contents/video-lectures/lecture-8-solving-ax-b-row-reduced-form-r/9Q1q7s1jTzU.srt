1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,750
OK, when the camera
says, we'll start.

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,320
You want to give me a signal?

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,290
OK, this is lecture
eight in linear algebra,

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,020
and this is the lecture
where we completely

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,820
solve linear equations.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,810
So Ax=b.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,040
That's our goal.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,159
If it has a solution.

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,990
It certainly can happen
that there is no solution.

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,370
We have to identify that
possibility by elimination.

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,110
And then if there is a solution
we want to find out is there

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,650
only one solution or are
-- is there a whole family

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,190
of solutions, and
then find them all.

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,370
OK.

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,420
Can I use as an
example the same matrix

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,010
that I had last
time when we were

17
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,890
looking for the null space.

18
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:10,060
So the, the matrix has
rows 1 2 2 2, 2 4 6 8,

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,150
and the third row -- you
remember the main point was

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:21,890
the third row, 3 6 8 10, is the
sum of row one plus row two.

21
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,710
In other words, if I add
those left-hand sides,

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,710
I get the third left-hand side.

23
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,530
So you can tell
me right away what

24
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,460
elimination is going to discover
about the right-hand sides.

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,570
What's -- there is a
condition on b1, b2,

26
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,690
and b3 for this system
to have a solution.

27
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:50,240
Most cases -- if I took
these numbers to be one --

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,950
5, and 17, there would
not be a solution.

29
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,700
In fact, if I took those
first numbers to be 1 and 5,

30
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,600
what is the only b3
that would be OK?

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,560
Six.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,860
If the left-hand -- if these
left-hand sides add up to that,

33
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,729
then B --

34
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,000
I need b1 plus b2 to equal b3.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,470
Let's just see how
elimination discovers that.

36
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,430
But we can see it coming, right?

37
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,450
That if -- let me say
it in other words.

38
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,300
If some combination
on the left-hand side

39
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,090
gives all 0s then
the same combination

40
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,580
on the right-hand
side must give 0.

41
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,080
OK.

42
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,670
So let me take that
example and write down

43
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,670
instead of copying out
all the plus signs,

44
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,830
let me write down the matrix.

45
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:59,130
1 2 2 2, 2 4 6 8,
and that 6 3 8 10,

46
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,930
where the third row is the
sum of the first two rows.

47
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,700
Now how do we deal with
the right-hand side?

48
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,840
That's -- we want to do the same
thing to the right-hand side

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,700
that we're doing to these
rows on the left side,

50
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,920
so we just tack on the
right-hand side as another

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,660
vector, another column.

52
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,220
So this is the augmented matrix.

53
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,840
It's, it's the matrix A
with the vector b tacked on.

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,440
In Matlab, that's all
you would need to type.

55
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,050
OK.

56
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,470
So we do elimination on that.

57
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,580
Can we just do
elimination quickly?

58
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,790
The first pivot is fine,
I subtract two of this

59
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,470
away from this, three
of this away from this,

60
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,870
so I have 1 2 2 2 b1.

61
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,840
Two of those away will
give me 0 0 2 and 4,

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,570
and that was b2 minus two b1.

63
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,130
I, I have to do the same
thing to that third,

64
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,630
that last column.

65
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,700
And then three of
these away from this

66
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,980
gave me 0 0 2 4 b3
minus three b1s.

67
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,660
So that's the,
that's elimination

68
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,830
with the first column completed.

69
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,750
We move on.

70
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,570
There's the first pivot still.

71
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,500
Here is the second pivot.

72
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,660
We're always remembering,
now, these are then

73
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,650
going to be the pivot columns.

74
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,640
And let me get the final
result -- well, let me --

75
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,615
can I do it by eraser?

76
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,680
We're capable of subtracting
this row from this row,

77
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,280
just by -- that'll knock this
out completely and give me

78
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,090
the row of 0s, and on
the right-hand side,

79
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,660
when I subtract this away
from this, what do I have?

80
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:22,550
I think I have b3 minus a b2,
and I had minus three b1s.

81
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,380
This is going to, it's
going to be a minus a b1.

82
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh yeah that's
exactly what I expect.

83
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,430
So now the -- what's
the last equation?

84
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,930
The last equation, this
represented by this zero row,

85
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:45,750
that last equation is, says 0
equals b3 minus b2 minus b1.

86
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,519
So that's the condition
for solvability.

87
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,310
That's the condition
on the right-hand side

88
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,450
that we expected.

89
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,900
It says that b1+b2
has to match b3,

90
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,350
and if our numbers happen
to have been 1, 5, and 6 --

91
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,220
so let me take,
suppose b is 1 5 6.

92
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,920
That's an OK b.

93
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,120
And when I do this
elimination, what will I have?

94
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,390
The b1 will still be a 1.

95
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,950
b2 would be 5 minus
2, this would be a 3.

96
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:24,860
5 -- my 6 minus 5 minus
1, this will be --

97
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,800
this is the main point --
this will be a 0, thanks.

98
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,300
OK.

99
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,720
So the last equation is OK now.

100
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,880
And I can proceed to solve the
two equations that are really

101
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,160
there with four unknowns.

102
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,660
OK, I, I, I want to do
that, so this, this b is OK.

103
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,700
It allows a solution.

104
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,850
We're going to be,
naturally, interested

105
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:04,200
to keep track what are
the conditions on b that

106
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,550
make the equation solvable.

107
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,020
So let me write down
what we already see

108
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,490
before I continue to solve it.

109
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,286
Let me first --
solvability, solvability.

110
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:31,015
So which -- so this is the
condition on the right-hand

111
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:31,515
sides.

112
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,010
And what is that condition?

113
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,440
This is solvability
always of Ax=b.

114
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,150
So Ax=b is solvable --

115
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,870
well, actually, we had an answer
in the language of the column

116
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,640
space.

117
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,530
Can you remind me
what that answer is?

118
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,510
That, that was like our
answer from earlier lecture.

119
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,980
b had to be in the column space.

120
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:10,140
Solvable if -- when -- exactly
when b is in the column space

121
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,560
of A.

122
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,110
Right?

123
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,840
That just says that b has to be
a combination of the columns,

124
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,890
and of course that's exactly
what the equation is looking

125
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,660
for.

126
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,800
So that -- now I
want to answer it --

127
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,050
the same answer but
in different language.

128
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,990
Another way to answer this --

129
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:52,980
if a combination of the rows
of A gives the zero row,

130
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,010
and this was an example
where it happened,

131
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,940
some combination of the rows
of A produced the zero row --

132
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,560
then what's the
requirement on b?

133
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,130
Since we're going to do the
same thing to both sides of all

134
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,520
equations --

135
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:16,190
the same combination of the
components of b has to give 0.

136
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,740
Right?

137
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,590
That's -- so if there's a
combination of the rows that

138
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:29,920
gives the zero row, then the
same combination of the entries

139
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,700
of b must give 0.

140
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,475
And this isn't the zero
row, that's the zero number.

141
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,860
Tthis is another way of saying
-- and it is not immediate,

142
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:54,582
OK. right, that these two
statements are equivalent.

143
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:56,290
But somehow they must
be, because they're

144
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,961
both equivalent to the
solvability of the system.

145
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:00,460
OK.

146
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,030
So we've got this, this sort
of -- like question zero is,

147
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,180
does the system have a solution?

148
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,670
OK, I'll come back to
discuss that further.

149
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,310
Let's go forward when it does.

150
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,470
When there is a solution.

151
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,684
And so what's our job now?

152
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:24,600
Abstractly we sit back
and we say, OK, there's

153
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,660
a solution, finished.

154
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,570
It exists.

155
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,450
But we want to construct it.

156
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:34,500
So what's the
algorithm, the sequence

157
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,330
of steps to find the solution?

158
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,670
That's what I --

159
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,130
and of course the
quiz and the final,

160
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,440
I'm going to give you a system
Ax=b and I'm going to ask you

161
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,350
for the solution,
if there is one.

162
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:54,430
And so this algorithm
that you want to follow.

163
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,290
OK, let's see.

164
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:13,190
So what's the -- so now to find
the complete solution to Ax=b.

165
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,000
OK.

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,150
Let me start by
finding one solution,

167
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,410
one particular solution.

168
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,060
I'm expecting that I can,
because my system of equations

169
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,730
now, that last equation
is zero equals zero,

170
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,850
so that's all fine.

171
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,720
I really have two equations --

172
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,910
actually I've got
four unknowns, so I'm

173
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,410
expecting to find
not only a solution

174
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,230
but a whole bunch of them.

175
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,020
But let's just find one.

176
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,930
So step one, a particular
solution, x particular.

177
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,010
How do I find one
particular solution?

178
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,740
Well, let me tell you
how I, how I find it.

179
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,160
So this is --

180
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,080
since there are
lots of solutions,

181
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,100
you could have your own way
to find a particular one.

182
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,780
But this is a
pretty natural way.

183
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:20,880
Set all free variables to zero.

184
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,810
Since those free variables are
the guys that can be anything,

185
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,790
the most convenient
choice is zero.

186
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:37,975
And then solve Ax=b for
the pivot variables.

187
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,240
So what does that
mean in this example?

188
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,490
Which are the free variables?

189
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,500
Which, which are the variables
that we can assign freely

190
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
and then there's
one and only one way

191
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,070
to find the pivot variables?

192
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:01,120
They're x2 and -- so x2 is
zero, because that's in a column

193
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,280
without a pivot, the
second column has no pivot.

194
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,010
And the -- what's the other one?

195
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,620
The fourth, x4 is zero.

196
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,330
Because that, those
are the, the free ones.

197
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,870
Those are in the
columns with no pivots.

198
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,300
So you see what my
-- so when I knock --

199
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:28,660
when x2 and x4 are zero,
I'm left with the --

200
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,010
what I left with here?

201
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,460
I'm just left with --

202
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,500
see, now I'm not
using the two free

203
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,020
columns.

204
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,380
I'm only using
the pivot columns.

205
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,370
So I'm really left with x1 --

206
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,360
the first equation
is just x1 and two

207
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,720
x3s should be the
right-hand side, which

208
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,700
we picked to be a one.

209
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,130
And the second
equation is two x3s,

210
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,735
as it happened, turned
out to be, three.

211
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,680
I just write it again here
with the x2 and the x4

212
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,420
knocked out, since
we're set them to zero.

213
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,150
And you see that we're back in
the normal case of having back

214
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,030
-- where back
substitution will do it.

215
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:21,640
So x3 is three halves,
and then we go back up

216
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,490
and x1 is one minus two x3.

217
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,270
That's probably minus two.

218
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,400
Good.

219
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,210
So now we have the
solution, x particular

220
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:41,940
is the vector minus two
zero three halves zero.

221
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,790
OK, good.

222
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:52,200
That's one particular solution,
and we should and could plug it

223
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,600
into the original system.

224
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,010
Really if -- on
the quiz, please,

225
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,230
it's a good thing to do.

226
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,650
So we did all this,
these, row operations,

227
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,960
but this is supposed to
solve the original system,

228
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,430
and I think it does.

229
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,120
OK.

230
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,810
So that's x particular
which we've got.

231
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,320
So that's like what's new today.

232
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,780
The particular solution comes
-- first you check that you have

233
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,700
zero equals zero, so
you're OK on the last

234
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,920
equations.

235
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,980
And then you set the
free variables to zero,

236
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,830
solve for the pivot
variables, and you've

237
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,500
got a particular solution,
the particular solution that

238
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,150
has zero free variables.

239
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,040
OK.

240
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,000
Now -- but that's
only one solution,

241
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,270
and now I'm looking for all.

242
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,480
So how do I find the rest?

243
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:58,770
The point is I can add on x --
anything out of the null space.

244
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,190
We know how to find the
vectors in the null space --

245
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,950
because we did it last time,
but I'll remind you what we

246
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,710
got.

247
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,620
And then I'll add.

248
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,650
So the final result will be
that the complete solution --

249
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,620
this is now the complete guy --

250
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,980
the complete solution is
this one particular solution

251
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:34,930
plus any, any vector,
all different vectors out

252
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,600
of the null space.

253
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,050
xn, OK.

254
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,630
Well why, why this pattern,
because this pattern shows up

255
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,560
through all of mathematics,
because it shows up everywhere

256
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,690
we have linear equations.

257
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,050
Let me just put here
the, the reason.

258
00:16:52,050 --> 00:17:01,830
A xp, so that's x particular,
so what does Ax particular give?

259
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,410
That gives the correct
right-hand side b.

260
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:10,520
And what does A times an
x in the null space give?

261
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,710
Zero.

262
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:17,920
So I add, and I
put in parentheses.

263
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:25,420
So xp plus xn is b
plus zero, which is b.

264
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,540
So -- oh, what I saying?

265
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,450
Let me just say it in words.

266
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:36,800
If I have one solution,
I can add on anything

267
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,600
in the null space, because
anything in the null space

268
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,910
has a zero right-hand
side, and I still

269
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,670
have the correct
right-hand side B.

270
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,850
So that's my system.

271
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,290
That's my complete solution.

272
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:54,620
Now let me write out what
that will be for this example.

273
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:02,070
So in this example, x
general, x complete,

274
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,440
the complete solution,
is x particular,

275
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,230
which is minus two
zero three halves zero,

276
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,900
with those zeroes in the
free variable, plus --

277
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,410
you remember there were the
special solutions in the null

278
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,680
space that had a one in
the free variables --

279
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,220
or one and zero in
the free variables,

280
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,880
and then we filled in to find
I've forgotten what they were,

281
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,020
but maybe it was
that. the others?

282
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,010
That was a special
solution, and then

283
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,950
there was another
special solution that

284
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,820
had that free variable zero and
this free variable equal one,

285
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,260
and I have to fill those in.

286
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,420
Let's see, can I remember
how those fill in?

287
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,570
Maybe this was a minus
two and this was a two,

288
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,070
possibly?

289
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,700
I think probably that's right.

290
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,290
I'm not -- yeah.

291
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:05,230
Does that look write to you?

292
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,480
I would have to remember
what are my equations.

293
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,930
Can I, rather than go
way back to that board,

294
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,680
let me remember the
first equation was

295
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,520
two x3 plus two x4
equaling zero now,

296
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,450
because I'm looking for
the guys in the null space.

297
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:28,510
So I set x4 to be one
and the second equation,

298
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,850
that I didn't copy again, gave
me minus two for this and then

299
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,090
-- yeah, so I
think that's right.

300
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:40,131
Two minus four and
two gives zero, check.

301
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:40,630
OK.

302
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,830
Those were the
special solutions.

303
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,060
What do we do to get
the complete solution?

304
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,270
How do I get the
complete solution now?

305
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:57,020
I multiply this by
anything, c1, say,

306
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,930
and I multiply
this by anything --

307
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,960
I take any combination.

308
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,140
Remember that's how we
described the null space?

309
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,060
The null space consists
of all combinations of --

310
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,760
so this is xn --

311
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,430
all combinations of
the special solutions.

312
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,410
There were two special
solutions because there

313
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,730
were two free variables.

314
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,560
And we want to
make that count --

315
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,660
carefully now.

316
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,857
Just while I'm up here.

317
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:30,190
So there's, that's what the
-- that's the kind of answer

318
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,230
I'm looking for.

319
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,810
Is there a constant
multiplying this guy?

320
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,790
Is there a free constant
that multiplies x particular?

321
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,180
No way.

322
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,430
Right? x particular
solves A xp=b.

323
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,450
I'm not allowed to
multiply that by three.

324
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,120
But Axn, I'm allowed to
multiply xn by three,

325
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,790
or add to another xn, because I
keep getting zero on the right.

326
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,290
OK.

327
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,250
So, so again, xp is
one particular guy.

328
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,630
xn is a whole subspace.

329
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,590
Right?

330
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,380
It's one guy plus, plus
anything from a subspace.

331
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,120
Let me draw it.

332
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,740
Let me try to -- oh.

333
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,950
I want to draw, I want
to graph all this --

334
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:25,910
I want to, I want to
plot all solutions.

335
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,020
Now x.

336
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,850
So what dimension I in?

337
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,950
This is a unfortunate point.

338
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,650
How many components does x have?

339
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,150
Four.

340
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,280
There are four unknowns.

341
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:47,150
So I have to draw a four
dimensional picture on this MIT

342
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,450
cheap blackboard.

343
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:48,950
OK.

344
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,970
So here we go.

345
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:58,080
x1 -- Einstein could do
it, but, this, this is --

346
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:06,090
those are four
perpendicular axes in --

347
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,740
representing four
dimensional space.

348
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,720
OK.

349
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,520
Where are my solutions?

350
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,580
Do my solutions form a subspace?

351
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,470
Does the set of solutions
to Ax=b form a subspace?

352
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,900
No way.

353
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,890
What does it actually
look like, though?

354
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,530
A subspace is in this picture.

355
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,250
This part is a subspace, right?

356
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,060
That part is some,
like, two dimensional,

357
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,860
because I've got two
parameters, so it's --

358
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:41,120
I'm thinking of this null space
as a two dimensional subspace

359
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,890
inside R^4.

360
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,410
Now I have to tell you and
will tell you next time,

361
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,760
what does it mean to say a
subspace, what's the dimension

362
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,580
of a subspace.

363
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,680
But you see what
it's going to be.

364
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:58,180
It's the number of free
independent constants

365
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,750
that we can choose.

366
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,560
So somehow there'll be a two
dimensional subspace, not

367
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,860
a line, and not a three
dimensional plane, but only

368
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,110
a two dimensional guy.

369
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,710
But it's doesn't go
through the origin

370
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,600
because it goes
through this point.

371
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,350
So there's x particular.

372
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,970
x particular is somewhere here.

373
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,580
x particular.

374
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,750
So it's somehow a subspace --
can I try to draw it that way?

375
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:36,070
It's a two dimensional subspace
that goes through x particular

376
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,970
and then onwards by --
so there's x particular,

377
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,090
and I added on
xn, and there's x.

378
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,420
There's x=xp+xn.

379
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,430
But the xn was anywhere
in this subspace,

380
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:56,700
so that filled out a plane.

381
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,930
It's a subspace --

382
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,320
it's not a subspace,
what I saying?

383
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,220
It's like a flat thing,
it's like a subspace,

384
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,450
but it's been shifted,
away from the origin.

385
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,450
It doesn't contain zero.

386
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,200
Thanks.

387
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,150
OK.

388
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,340
That's the picture, and
that's the algorithm.

389
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,940
So the algorithm is just
go through elimination

390
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,150
and, find the
particular solution,

391
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,290
and then find those
special solutions.

392
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,010
You can do that.

393
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,620
Let me take our time here
in the lecture to think,

394
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,240
about the bigger picture.

395
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,030
So let me think about --

396
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,050
so this is my pattern.

397
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,040
Now I want to think --

398
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:54,410
I want to ask you
about a question --

399
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,260
I want to ask you
some questions.

400
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,070
So when I mean think bigger,
I mean I'll think about an m

401
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:09,495
by n matrix A of rank r.

402
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,140
OK.

403
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,630
What's our definition of rank?

404
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,910
Our current definition of
rank is number of pivots.

405
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,410
OK.

406
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,400
First of all, how are
these numbers related?

407
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,050
Can you tell me a
relation between r and m?

408
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,860
If I have m rows in the
matrix and R pivots, --

409
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:42,240
then I certainly know, always --

410
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,890
what relation do I
know between r and m?

411
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,810
r is less or equal, right?

412
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,620
Because I've got m rows, I
can't have more than m pivots,

413
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,720
I might have m and
I might have fewer.

414
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,980
Also, I've got n columns.

415
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,630
So what's the relation
between r and n?

416
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:10,480
It's the same, less or
equal, because a column

417
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,150
can't have more than one pivot.

418
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,450
So I can't have more
than n pivots altogether.

419
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,740
OK, OK.

420
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,360
So I have an m by
n matrix of rank r.

421
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,420
And I always know r less than
or equal to m, r less than

422
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,560
or equal to n.

423
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,870
Now I'm specially
interested in the case

424
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:35,540
of full rank, when the rank
r is as big as it can be.

425
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:40,840
Well, I guess I've got two
separate possibilities here,

426
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,310
depending on what these
numbers m and n are.

427
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:49,970
So let me talk about the
case of full column rank.

428
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,958
And by that I mean r=n.

429
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:11,960
And I want to ask you, what does
that imply about our solutions?

430
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,190
What does that tell us
about the null space?

431
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,240
What does that tell us
about, the complete solution?

432
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,860
OK, so what does that mean?

433
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:28,520
So I want to ask you,
well, OK, if the rank is

434
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,580
n, what does that mean?

435
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,570
That means there's a
pivot in every column.

436
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,280
So how many pivot
variables are there?

437
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,160
n.

438
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,150
All the columns have
pivots in this case.

439
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,150
So how many free
variables are there?

440
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,460
None at all.

441
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,770
So no free variables.

442
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,770
r=n, no free variables.

443
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,270
So what does that
tell us about what's

444
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:04,610
going to happen then in our,
in our little algorithms?

445
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:07,440
What will be in the null space?

446
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,570
The null space of A
has got what in it?

447
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,990
Only the zero vector.

448
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,590
There are no free variables
to give other values to.

449
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,780
So the null space is
only the zero vector.

450
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:33,580
And what about our
solution to Ax=b?

451
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:38,510
Solution to Ax=b?

452
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,790
What, what's the
story on that one?

453
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,950
So now that's coming
from today's lecture.

454
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:51,020
The solution x is --

455
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,290
what's the complete solution?

456
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,570
It's just x particular, right?

457
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,830
If, if, if there is an x,
if there is a solution.

458
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,190
It's x equal x particular.

459
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,900
There's nothing -- you know,
there's just one solution.

460
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,050
If there's one at all.

461
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,920
So it's unique solution --

462
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,900
unique means only one --

463
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:22,945
unique solution if it
exists, if it exists.

464
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,880
In other words, I would say --
let me put it a different way.

465
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,910
There're either zero
or one solutions.

466
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,920
This is all in this case r=n.

467
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:50,400
So I'm -- because many, many
applications in reality,

468
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,693
the columns will be what
I'll later call independent.

469
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:04,340
And we'll have, nothing to
look for in the null space,

470
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,611
and we'll only have
particular solutions.

471
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:07,110
OK.

472
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,500
Everybody see that possibility?

473
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,920
But I need an example, right?

474
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,590
So let me create an example.

475
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:23,170
What sort of a matrix -- what's
the shape of a matrix that has

476
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,390
full column rank?

477
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:30,140
So can I squeeze in
an, an example here?

478
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:35,080
If it exists.

479
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,150
Let me put in an example,
and it's just the right space

480
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:41,140
to put in an example.

481
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,330
Because the example will
be like tall and thin.

482
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,940
It will have --

483
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:54,140
well, I mean, here's an example,
one two six five, three one

484
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,130
one one.

485
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,610
Brilliant example.

486
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,590
OK.

487
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:06,039
So there's a matrix A,
and what's its rank?

488
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,330
What's the rank of that matrix?

489
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,235
How many pivots will I
find if I do elimination?

490
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,810
Two, right?

491
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:16,990
Two.

492
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,320
I see a pivot there --

493
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,730
oh certainly those two
columns are headed off

494
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,810
in different directions.

495
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,870
When I do elimination, I'll
certainly get another pivot

496
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:35,270
here, fine, and I can use those
to clean out below and above.

497
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:43,960
So the -- actually, tell me
what its row reduced row echelon

498
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,360
form would be.

499
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,410
Can you carry that,
that elimination

500
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,360
process to the bitter end?

501
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,590
So what do, what does that mean?

502
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,610
I subtract a multiple of
this row from these rows.

503
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,910
So I clean up, all zeros there.

504
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,540
Then I've got some pivot here.

505
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,140
What do I do with that?

506
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,330
I go subtract it
below and above,

507
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,860
and then I divide through,
and what's R for that example?

508
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,450
Maybe I can -- you'll allow
me to put that just here

509
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,580
in the next board.

510
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,150
What's the row reduced echelon
form, just out of practice,

511
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,300
for that matrix?

512
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,800
It's got ones in the pivots.

513
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,750
It's got the identity matrix,
a little two by two identity

514
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,270
matrix, and below it all zeros.

515
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:43,940
That's a matrix that really
has two independent rows,

516
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,510
and they're the
first two, actually.

517
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,280
The first two rows
are independent.

518
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,190
They're not in the
same direction.

519
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,660
But the other rows are
combinations of the first two,

520
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,970
so --

521
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,850
is there always a
solution to Ax=b?

522
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,050
Tell me what's the picture here?

523
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:06,880
For this matrix A, this is
a case of full column rank.

524
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,320
The two columns are
-- give two pivots.

525
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,090
There's nothing
in the null space.

526
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,540
There's no combination
of those columns

527
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,001
that gives the zero column
except the zero zero

528
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:19,500
combination.

529
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:25,400
So there's nothing
in the null space.

530
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,830
But is there always a
solution to A X equal B?

531
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,530
What's up with A X equal B?

532
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:38,220
I've got four, four equations
here, and only two Xs.

533
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,460
So the answer is certainly no.

534
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,240
There's not always a solution.

535
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,660
I may have zero solutions,
and if I make a random choice,

536
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,590
I'll have zero solutions.

537
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,690
Or if I make a great particular
choice of the right-hand side,

538
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,160
which just happens to be a
combination of those two guys

539
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,500
-- like tell me one right-hand
side that would have

540
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,540
a solution.

541
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,190
Tell me a right-hand side
that would have a solution.

542
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,800
Well, 0 0 0 0, OK.

543
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,880
No prize for that one.

544
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,250
Tell me another one.

545
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,850
Another right-hand side that
has a solution would be 4 3 7 6.

546
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,900
I could add the two columns.

547
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,070
What would be the total
complete solution if the

548
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,360
Right? right-hand
side was 4 3 7 6?

549
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,489
There would be the
particular solution one

550
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:34,067
one, one of that column
plus one of that,

551
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:35,150
and that would be the only

552
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,429
solution.

553
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:39,770
So there would be -- x
particular would be one one

554
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,560
in the case when the right
side is the sum of those two

555
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,850
columns, and that's it.

556
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,670
So that would be a
case with one solution.

557
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,250
OK.

558
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:55,469
That, this is the typical
setup with full column rank.

559
00:34:55,469 --> 00:35:00,000
Now I go to full row rank.

560
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,260
You see the sort of natural
symmetry of this discussion.

561
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:14,523
Full row rank means r=m.

562
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,940
So this is what I'm
interested in now, r=m.

563
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,710
OK, what's up with that?

564
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,010
How many pivots?

565
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,000
m.

566
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,060
So what happens when we do
elimination in that case?

567
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,520
I'm going to get m pivots.

568
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,520
So every row has a pivot, right?

569
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,855
Every row has a pivot.

570
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,950
Then what about solvability?

571
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,880
What about this business of --
for which right-hand sides can

572
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,120
I solve it?

573
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,970
So that's my question.

574
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:14,180
I can solve Ax=b for
which right-hand sides?

575
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,450
Do you see what's coming?

576
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:23,990
I do elimination, I
don't get any zero rows.

577
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,890
So there aren't any
requirements on b.

578
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,730
I can solve Ax=b for every b.

579
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,990
I can solve Ax=b for
every right-hand side.

580
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:46,705
So this is the existence,
exists a solution.

581
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:57,180
Now tell me, so the, u- u- so
every row has a pivot in it.

582
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,820
So how many free
variables are there?

583
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,780
How many free
variables in this case?

584
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,560
If I had n variables
to start with,

585
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,180
how many are used up
by pivot variables?

586
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,890
r, which is m.

587
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:25,600
So I'm left with, left
with n-r free variables.

588
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:31,910
OK.

589
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:37,220
So this case of full row
rank I can always solve,

590
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,440
and then this tells me how
many variables are free,

591
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,400
and this is of course n-m.

592
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,040
This is n-m free variables.

593
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,980
Can I do an example?

594
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,750
You know, the best way for
me to do an example is just

595
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,140
to transpose that example.

596
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,950
So let me take, let me take
that matrix that had column one

597
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,970
two six five and make it a row.

598
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:11,470
And let me take three one
one one as the second row.

599
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:18,700
And let me ask you, this is
my matrix A, what's its rank?

600
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,230
What's the rank of that matrix?

601
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:24,560
Sorry to ask, but
not sorry really,

602
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,130
because we're just
getting the idea of rank.

603
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,770
What's the rank of that matrix?

604
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:32,260
Two, exactly, two.

605
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,770
There will be two pivots.

606
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,770
What will the row
reduced echelon form be?

607
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,850
Anybody know that one?

608
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,230
Actually, tell me not only --
you have to tell me not only

609
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,110
the, there'll be two pivots
but which will be the pivot

610
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,550
columns.

611
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:50,060
Which columns of this matrix
will be pivot columns?

612
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,140
So the first column
is fine, and then

613
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,720
I go on to the next
column, and what do I get?

614
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,640
Do I get a second
pivot out of --

615
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,410
will I get a second
pivot in this position?

616
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,300
Yes.

617
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:07,200
So the pivots, when I get all
the way to R, will be there.

618
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,860
And here will be some numbers.

619
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:18,670
This is the part that
I previously called F.

620
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:23,720
This is the part that -- the
pivot columns in R will be

621
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,680
the identity matrix.

622
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,300
There are no zero rows, no zero
rows, because the rank is two.

623
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,630
But there'll be stuff over here.

624
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:42,530
And that will, enter the special
solutions and the null space.

625
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,230
OK.

626
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:51,840
So this is a typical matrix
with r=m smaller than n.

627
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,135
Now finally I've got a
space here for r=m=n.

628
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,190
I'm off in the corner here with
the most important case of all.

629
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,910
So what's up with this matrix?

630
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,970
So let me give an example.

631
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:15,065
OK, brilliant example, 1 2 3 1.

632
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,628
Tell me what -- how do I
describe a matrix that has rank

633
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:24,127
r=m=n?

634
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:32,560
So the matrix is square,
right, it's a square matrix.

635
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,350
And if I know its rank is
-- it's full rank, now.

636
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,290
I don't have to say full
column rank or full row rank --

637
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:43,800
I just say full rank, because
the count, column count

638
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,130
and the row count are
the same, and the rank

639
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,040
is as big as it can be.

640
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,090
And what kind of a
matrix have I got?

641
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,670
It's invertible.

642
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:01,510
So that's exactly the
invertible matrices.

643
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:06,310
r=m=n means the -- what's
the row echelon form,

644
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:10,920
the reduced row echelon form,
for an invertible matrix?

645
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,630
For a square, nice,
square, invertible matrix?

646
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,320
It's I.

647
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,880
Right.

648
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,530
So you see that the,
the good matrices

649
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:31,580
are the ones that kind of
come out trivially in R.

650
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,270
You reduce them all the
way to the identity matrix.

651
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,900
What's the null space for
this, for this matrix?

652
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,170
Can I just hammer
away with questions?

653
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,160
What's the null space
for this matrix?

654
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:51,570
The null space of that matrix
is the zero vector only.

655
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:54,660
The zero vector only.

656
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,530
What are the conditions
to solve Ax=b?

657
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,950
Which right-hand sides b are OK?

658
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:07,560
If I want to solve Ax=b for
this example, so A is this,

659
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:14,140
b is b1 b2, what are the
conditions on b1 and b2?

660
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,170
None at all, right.

661
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:21,850
So this is the case, this is
the case where I can solve --

662
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:25,660
so I've coming back here, I
can -- since the rank equals m,

663
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,460
I can solve for every b.

664
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:33,840
And since the rank is also
n, there's a unique solution.

665
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,640
Let me summarize the
whole picture here.

666
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,210
Here's the whole picture.

667
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:44,780
I could have r=m=n.

668
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:51,190
This is the case where this
is the identity matrix.

669
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,595
And this is the case where
there is one solution.

670
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:02,300
That's the square
invertible chapter two case.

671
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,420
Now we're into chapter three.

672
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,330
We could have r=m
smaller than n.

673
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,730
Now that's what
we had over there,

674
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:17,610
and the row echelon form
looked like the identity

675
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:18,960
with some zero rows.

676
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,565
And that was the case where
there are zero or one solution.

677
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,420
When I say solution
I mean to Ax=b.

678
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,590
So this case,
there's always one.

679
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:42,130
This case there's zero or one.

680
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:45,640
And now let me take the
case of full column rank,

681
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:55,860
but some, extra rows.

682
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:00,000
So now R has --

683
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,700
well, the identity --

684
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,280
I'm almost tempted to write
the identity matrix and then F,

685
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,130
but that isn't
necessarily right.

686
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:20,360
I have -- is that right?

687
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,310
Am I getting this correct here?

688
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:25,430
Oh, I'm not!

689
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,390
My God!

690
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:33,330
This is the case R equals n,
the columns, the columns are,

691
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,390
are OK.

692
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:38,770
That's the case that was on that
board, r=n, full column rank.

693
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:43,240
Now I want the case
where m is smaller than n

694
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,550
and I've got extra columns.

695
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:47,050
OK.

696
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:47,810
There we go.

697
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:57,140
So this is now the
case of full row rank,

698
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:02,070
and it looks like
I F except that I

699
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:08,430
can't be sure that the pivot
columns are the first columns.

700
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:14,690
So the I and the F, could
be partly mixed into the I.

701
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:18,670
Can I write that
with just like that?

702
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:23,830
So the F could be sort
of partly into the I

703
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:28,450
if the first columns
weren't the pivot columns.

704
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:31,760
Now how many solutions
in this case?

705
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,330
There's always a solution.

706
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,850
This is the existence case.

707
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:37,020
There's always a solution.

708
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,160
We're not getting any zero rows.

709
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,430
There are no zero rows here.

710
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:45,635
So there's always either one
or infinitely many solutions.

711
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:50,560
OK.

712
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,600
Actually, I guess there's
always an infinite number,

713
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:02,760
because we always have some
null space to deal with.

714
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,150
Then the final case is
where r is smaller than m

715
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:08,880
and smaller than n.

716
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,380
OK.

717
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:14,830
Now that's the case
where R is the identity

718
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:19,920
with some free stuff but
with some zero rows too.

719
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,580
And that's the case where
there's either no solution --

720
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:29,200
because we didn't get a zero
equals zero for some bs,

721
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,330
or infinitely many solutions.

722
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,010
OK.

723
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:44,310
Do you -- this board really
summarizes the lecture,

724
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:47,370
and this sentence
summarizes the lecture.

725
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:55,070
The rank tells you everything
about the number of solutions.

726
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:57,010
That number, the
rank r, tells you

727
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:01,620
all the information except the
exact entries in the solutions.

728
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,140
For that you go to the matrix.

729
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,150
OK, good.

730
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,770
Have a great weekend, and
I'll see you on Monday.
