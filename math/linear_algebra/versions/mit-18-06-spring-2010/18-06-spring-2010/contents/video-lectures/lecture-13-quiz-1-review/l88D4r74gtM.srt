1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,100
OK.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:16,500
Uh this is the review
lecture for the first part

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,880
of the course, the Ax=b
part of the course.

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:28,710
And the exam will
emphasize chapter three.

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,890
Because those are
the --0 chapter

6
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,940
three was about the
rectangular matrices

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,750
where we had null spaces and
null spaces of A transpose,

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,450
and ranks, and all
the things that

9
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:49,890
are so clear when the matrix
is square and invertible,

10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:57,080
they became things to think
about for rectangular matrices.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,590
So, and vector spaces and
subspaces and above all

12
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,400
those four subspaces.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,940
OK, I'm thinking to
start at least I'll

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,210
just look at old exams,
read out questions, write

15
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,320
on the board what
I need to and we

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,980
can see what the answers are.

17
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,420
The first one I see is
one I can just read out.

18
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,930
Well, I'll write a little.

19
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:32,145
Suppose u, v and w are
nonzero vectors in R^7.

20
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:44,190
What are the possible -- they
span a -- a vector space.

21
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,510
They span a subspace of R^7,
and what are the possible

22
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,130
dimensions?

23
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,840
So that's a
straightforward question,

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,610
what are the possible dimensions
of the subspace spanned

25
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,040
by u, v and w?

26
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,430
OK, one, two, or three, right.

27
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,320
One, two or three.

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,930
Couldn't be more because
we've only got three vectors,

29
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,430
and couldn't be zero because --

30
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,030
because I told you the
vectors were nonzero.

31
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,020
Otherwise if I allowed the
possibility that those were all

32
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,319
the zero vector -- then the
zero-dimensional subspace would

33
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,110
have been in there.

34
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,250
OK.

35
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,970
Now can I jump to a
more serious question?

36
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,600
OK.

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,850
We have a five by three matrix.

38
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,860
And I'm calling it U.

39
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,010
I'm saying it's in echelon form.

40
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,600
And it has three pivots, r=3.

41
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,810
Three pivots.

42
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,140
Ok.

43
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,820
First question what's
the null space?

44
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,865
What's the null
space of this matrix

45
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:11,910
U, so this matrix is five by
three, and I find it helpful to

46
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,860
just see

47
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,750
visually what five by three
means, what that shape is.

48
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,420
Three columns.

49
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,810
Three columns in U,

50
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,040
then five rows,

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,430
three pivots,

52
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,650
and what's the null space?

53
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,360
The null space of U is --

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,000
and it asks for a
spec-of course I'm

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,390
looking for an answer
that isn't just

56
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,340
the definition of
the null space,

57
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,030
but is the null space of this
matrix, with this information.

58
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,220
And what is it?

59
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,110
It's only the zero vector.

60
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,810
Because we're told
that the rank is three,

61
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,840
so those three columns must be
independent, no combination --

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,890
of those columns is the
zero vector except --

63
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,671
so the only thing in this
null space is the zero vector,

64
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:02,170
and I --

65
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,030
I could even say what that
vector is, zero, columns also?

66
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,200
zero, zero.

67
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,870
That's OK.

68
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,020
So that's what's
in the null space.

69
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,015
All right? let me go on with
-- this question has multiple

70
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:15,515
parts.

71
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:24,950
What's the -- oh now it asks you
about a ten by three matrix, B,

72
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:31,530
which is the matrix U and two U.

73
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:37,340
It actually -- I would
probably be writing R --

74
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,630
and maybe I should be
writing R here now.

75
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:47,800
This exam goes back a few
years when I emphasized U more

76
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,980
than R.

77
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,630
Now, what's the echelon
form for that matrix?

78
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,150
So the echelon form,
what's the rank,

79
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,125
Yes. and what's
the echelon form?

80
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,270
Let's suppose this is
in reduced echelon form,

81
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:06,360
so that I could be
using the letter R.

82
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,480
So I'll ask for the reduced row
echelon form so imagine that

83
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:06,610
So I'm seeing the same length
in b, three, and also in x.

84
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,110
these are --

85
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,880
U is in reduced row
echelon form but now

86
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,500
I've doubled the
height of the matrix,

87
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,720
So the (x)-s that it multiplies
have three components,

88
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,150
what will happen when
we do row reduction?

89
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,950
What row reduction will
take us to what matrix here?

90
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,270
So you start doing elimination.

91
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,590
You're doing elimination
on single rows.

92
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,050
But of course we're
allowed to think of blocks.

93
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,820
So what, well, what's
the answer look like?

94
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,921
U and z- or R --

95
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,170
let's -- I'll stay with this
letter U but I'm what was

96
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:56,660
the name of that --2 winning
a million dollars or really

97
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,030
thinking it's in
reduced form, and zero.

98
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,710
OK.

99
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,810
Fine.

100
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:10,390
Then it asks oh, further,
it asks about this matrix.

101
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,720
U, U, U, and zero.

102
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,190
OK, what's the
echelon form of this?

103
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,050
So it's just like
practice in thinking

104
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,560
through what would
row elimination,

105
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,790
what would row reduction do.

106
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,450
Have I thought this through,
so what -- what are we --

107
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,920
if we start doing elimination,
basically we're going

108
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,030
to subtract these
rows from these --

109
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,080
In the column
space, because I do

110
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,190
know that it can so it's going
to take us to U, U, zero,

111
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,090
and minus U, For example, I'm
going to ask you for a I guess,

112
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:44,590
right?

113
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,240
But is it a- is
it three by three?

114
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,690
Take the thing all the way to R
-- let's suppose U is really R.

115
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,660
Suppose that we're really going
for the reduced row echelon

116
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:56,930
doing linear
algebra of course --

117
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,390
but I didn't have
to do the form.

118
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,090
Then would we stop there?

119
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,260
No.

120
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,740
We would clean out, we would
-- we could use this to --

121
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,770
is that right, can I
so I took this row --

122
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,540
these rows away from
these to get there.

123
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,885
Now I take these rows away from
these, so that gives me zero.

124
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,030
There. there?1 And now what
more would I do if I'm really

125
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,460
shooting for R, the
reduced row echelon form?

126
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,200
I would -- then I want
plus ones in the pivot,

127
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,750
so I would multiply through by
minus one to get plus there.

128
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,170
So essentially I'm seeing
reduced row echelon form

129
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,180
there and there, and there's
just one little twist

130
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,040
still to go.

131
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,324
Do you see what that
final twist might be?

132
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:52,490
It certainly has three rows.

133
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,790
To have if -- if U is in
reduced row echelon form and now

134
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:02,490
I'm looking at U, U, there's
one little step to take,

135
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,090
this isn't like a big
deal at all, but --

136
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,880
but if I really want this
to be in reduced form,

137
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,050
what would I still --

138
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,740
might I still have to do?

139
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,750
I might have some
zero rows here,

140
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,720
I might have some zero
rows here that strictly

141
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
should move to the bottom.

142
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,079
Well, I'm not going to
make a project out of that.

143
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,620
first of all?

144
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,760
OK.

145
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,445
What's the rank of that matrix?

146
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,250
What's the rank
of this matrix C?

147
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,854
Given that I know that the
original U has rank three,

148
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,020
what's the rank of this guy?

149
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,080
Six, right.

150
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,289
That has rank six, I can tell.

151
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,030
What was -- what's the
rank of this B, while --

152
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,159
while we're at on TV for a
few weeks, did you see that,

153
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,659
it?

154
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:56,690
The rank of B, is
that six or three?

155
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,200
So A is a three by three matrix.

156
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,300
Three is right.

157
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,940
Three is right.

158
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,520
Because we actually got it to
where we could just see three

159
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,330
pivots.

160
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,230
OK, and oh, now
finally this easy one,

161
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:15,020
what's the dimension be solved
exactly when B is in the column

162
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,410
space, of the null space --

163
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,370
of the null space
of C transpose?

164
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:22,980
Oh, boy.

165
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,260
OK, so what do I -- if I want
the dimension of a null space,

166
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,240
I want to know the
size of the matrix --

167
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,450
so what's the size
of the matrix C?

168
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:38,200
It looks like it's
ten by six, is it?

169
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:49,280
Ten by six, so C is ten by six,
so m is ten, so C has ten rows,

170
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,190
C transpose has ten columns,
so there are ten columns there.

171
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,950
So how many free variables
have I got, once I --

172
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,950
There's quite a few trues,
shall I take a poll,

173
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,950
if I start with the ten
columns in C transpose,

174
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,050
that's the m for the original C.

175
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,640
And what do I subtract off?

176
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,140
Six.

177
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,240
Because we said
that was the rank.

178
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,540
So I'm left with four.

179
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,040
Thanks.

180
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,540
OK.

181
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,840
If b is in the -- and what
would -- what does the exam say

182
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,080
So I think that's
the right answer --

183
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,580
the dimension of the null space
of C transpose would be four.

184
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,870
Right.

185
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,870
OK.

186
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,570
Yeah.

187
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,650
OK.

188
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:34,710
So that's one question, at
least it brought in some --

189
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,130
some of the dimension counts.

190
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:37,630
OK.

191
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,088
Here's another type of question.
think about, what's the --

192
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:44,520
what's the shape of the matrix,

193
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:52,870
I give you an equation,
Ax equals two four two.

194
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,590
And I give you the
complete solution.

195
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,992
And what's its rank?

196
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,325
But I don't give you the matrix.

197
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,810
And another -- there's another
vector, zero, zero, one.

198
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,310
OK.

199
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:16,450
All right.

200
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:22,660
My first question is what's
the dimension of the row space?

201
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,160
Of the matrix A?

202
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:31,890
So the main thing that you
want to get from this question

203
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,130
is that a question
could start this way.

204
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,770
exam, don't just tell me.

205
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,890
Sort of backward way.

206
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,130
so I guess I'm
asking you what is

207
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:50,420
the column space for this
basis for the null space.

208
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:56,770
By giving you the answer and
not telling you what the problem

209
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:02,590
homework, so I was watching
it, so there were three --

210
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,650
the is.

211
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,890
But we can get a
lot of information,

212
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,590
and sometimes we can
get complete information

213
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,710
about that matrix A.

214
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,240
OK.

215
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,530
So what's the dimension
of the row space of A?

216
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,120
What's the rank?

217
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,470
Tell me about what's the size
of the matrix, yeah, just --

218
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,230
These are the things
we want to matrix b

219
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,470
and I'll answer them
without multiplying it out.2

220
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:41,760
Its rank -- tell me something
about its null space,

221
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,000
I heard the right
answer for the rank,

222
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,700
the rank is one in this case.

223
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,230
Why?

224
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,940
Because the dimension
of the null space,

225
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,760
so the dimension of this
instant?3 the null space of A

226
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,050
is from knowing that that's the
complete solution, it's two.

227
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,760
I'm seeing two vectors
here, and they're

228
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,460
independent in the
null space of A,

229
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,170
because they have to be in the

230
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,400
OK, which -- did
you watch that quiz,

231
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,750
there was a quiz program null
space of A if I'm allowed

232
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,650
to throw into the solution
any amount of those vectors,

233
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,620
that tells me that's the
null space part then.

234
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,400
So the dimension of the null
space is two, and then I --

235
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,010
of course I know the dimensions
of all the -- four subspaces.

236
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,090
Now actually it asks
what's the matrix?

237
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:52,440
Well, what's the
matrix in this case?

238
00:13:52,440 --> 00:14:01,210
Do we want to -- shall I
try to figure that out?

239
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:01,790
Sure.

240
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,290
Let's -- you'd like
me to do it, OK.

241
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,164
Well, what's the ----

242
00:14:04,164 --> 00:14:05,590
I actually say in this in the

243
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:09,630
So what about the matrix,
or let me at least start it,

244
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,140
OK.

245
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,720
If A times this x
gives two, four, two,

246
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,300
what does that tell
me about the matrix A?

247
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:26,210
If A times that x solves that
equation then it tells me that

248
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,900
the first column is --

249
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:35,560
the first column of A is
-- one, two, one, right.

250
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,580
The first column of A
has to be one, two, one,

251
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:37,650
because if I
multiply by x, that's

252
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:37,730
going to multiply just
matrix? the first column,

253
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:37,790
and give me two, four, two.

254
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:37,900
And then I've got two
more columns to find,

255
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,000
and what information have
I got to find them with?

256
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,070
A basis for the null space.

257
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,130
I've got the null space.

258
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:38,230
So the fact that this
is in the null space,

259
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,370
what does that tell So what
is if b has the form --

260
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,411
so I guess I'm asking
what's me about the matrix?

261
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:59,047
A matrix that has zero,
zero, one in its null space?

262
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,840
That tells me that the last
column of the matrix is zeroes.

263
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,880
so how many think true?

264
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,820
Because this is
in the null space,

265
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,897
the last column has to be

266
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:16,230
When could it be solved? zeroes.

267
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,510
And because this is in
the null space, what's

268
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,850
the second column?

269
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,880
Well, this in the
null space means

270
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,910
that if I multiply
A by that vector

271
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,530
I must be getting zeroes, so I
think that better be minus one,

272
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:44,370
minus two, and minus one.

273
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,300
OK.

274
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,340
That's a type of question
that just brings out

275
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,050
the information that's in
that complete solution.

276
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,180
And then actually I go on to
ask what vectors -- for what

277
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,250
OK. vectors B can
Ax=b be solved?

278
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:53,380
Ax=b can be solved if what --
so I'm looking for a condition

279
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:53,460
Definitely not. on b,
if any. interesting --

280
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:53,550
the novel point was there
were three ways that

281
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:53,640
Can it be solved for
every right-hand side b?

282
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,140
No.

283
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:07,315
And the answer is --

284
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:25,505
yes or no --

285
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,054
right.

286
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:34,596
solvable?

287
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,920
the column space of this
matrix, and what is it?

288
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,810
It's so the column space of
that matrix is all multiples b

289
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,490
Can you tell me something --

290
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,170
so I'll ask questions
about this --

291
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:04,609
b is a multiple
of one, two, one.

292
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:05,290
Right?

293
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:14,140
I can solve the thing if it's
a multiple of one, two, one,

294
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,220
and of course sure enough --

295
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:24,140
yeah, that was a multiple
of one, two, one,

296
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,829
and so I had a solution.

297
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:34,640
So this is a case where
we've got lots of null space.

298
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:44,760
Let me just recall rank is
big, don't forget those cases,

299
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:57,390
don't forget the other cases
when r is as big as it can be,

300
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,580
OK. r equal m or r equal n.

301
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,970
Those are -- we had a full
lecture on that, the full rank,

302
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,480
full lecture, and important
-- important case.

303
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,471
I gave you every chance
to think about that.

304
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:13,970
OK.

305
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,760
I'll just move on.

306
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,800
I think this is the
best type of review.

307
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,380
So I'm going to
solve Bx equals zero.

308
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,080
It's just brings
these ideas out.

309
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,511
Apologies to the camera while
I recover glasses and exam.

310
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:31,010
OK.

311
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,700
How about a few true-false ones?

312
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,100
Actually there won't be
a true-false on the quiz.

313
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,980
But it gives us a
moment of quick review.

314
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,500
True or false, how do
you feel about it at

315
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,190
Here's one.

316
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,930
If the null space --

317
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,400
I have a square matrix.

318
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,740
If its null space is
just the zero vector,

319
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,750
what about the null
space of A transpose?

320
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,840
If the null space of A
is just the zero vector,

321
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,580
and the matrix is
square, what do I

322
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,430
know about the null
space of A transpose?

323
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,420
Also the zero vector.

324
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:07,960
Good.

325
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,270
And that's a very
very important fact.

326
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,630
OK.

327
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,000
How about this?

328
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,450
These -- look at the space
of five by five matrices

329
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,280
as a vector space.

330
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,690
So it's actually a
twenty-five-dimensional vector

331
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,190
space.

332
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,990
All five by five matrices.

333
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,770
Look at the invertible matrices.

334
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,430
Do they form a subspace?

335
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:40,430
So I have this five by --
a space of all five by five

336
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,580
matrices.

337
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,180
I can add them, I can
multiply by numbers.

338
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,110
But now I narrow down
to the invertible ones.

339
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,700
And I ask are they a subspace?

340
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,600
And you -- your answer is --

341
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,418
quiet, but nevertheless
definite, no.

342
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:00,800
Right?

343
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,040
Because if I add two invertible
matrices I have no idea if the

344
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,570
No. answer is invertible.

345
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,340
If I multiply that
invertible -- well,

346
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,600
it doesn't even have
the zero matrix in it,

347
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,630
it couldn't be a subspace.

348
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,020
I have to be able to
multiply by zero --

349
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,010
and stay in my subspace, and the
invertible ones wouldn't work.

350
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,210
Well, the singular ones
wouldn't work either.

351
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,540
They have zero -- the zero
matrix is in the singular

352
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,720
matrices, but if I add two
singular matrices I don't know

353
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,410
if the answer is
singular or not.

354
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,340
OK.

355
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,420
So another true-false.

356
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:36,510
If b squared equals
zero then b equals zero.

357
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:36,580
columns then the
question is does Ax=b,

358
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,904
is it always True or false?

359
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,320
If b squared equals zero, true,
false? you could get help,

360
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:40,820
right --

361
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:54,590
b squared equals zero, b has to
be a square -- square matrix,

362
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,960
so that I can
multiply it by itself,

363
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,910
does that imply that B is zero?

364
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:10,470
Are there matrices whose square
could be the zero matrix?

365
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,630
Yes or no?

366
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,830
Yes there are.

367
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,350
There are matrices whose
square is the zero matrix.

368
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,725
So this statement is false.

369
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,980
If b squared is zero, we
don't know that b is zero.

370
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,290
For example -- the best
example is that matrix.

371
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,510
That matrix is a
dangerous matrix.

372
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:42,580
It will come up in later parts
of this course as an example

373
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,890
of what can go wrong.

374
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,720
And here is a real
simple -- so this --

375
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,010
so if I square that without
doing the multiplication

376
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,940
and finding the
matrix b. matrix,

377
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:04,770
I do get the zero
matrix,and it shows --

378
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,270
OK.

379
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:16,220
A system of m
equations in m unknowns

380
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:30,620
is solvable for
every right-hand side

381
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:36,490
if the columns are independent.

382
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,870
So can I say that again, I'm --

383
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,750
I'll write it down then

384
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,440
OK.

385
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,820
for short.

386
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,270
m by m matrix independent

387
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:52,110
So give me a basis for --

388
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:56,250
for the null space of B.

389
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,630
Let's see.

390
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:03,150
but you could only
use each way once,

391
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:09,370
so you couldn't like
use them all the time.

392
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,440
So remember that?

393
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,650
You could -- so you
could poll the audience,

394
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,800
and that was a very --

395
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,630
that was a hundred
percent successful way,

396
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:31,460
so I'll poll the
audience on this.

397
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,920
If the other possibility --

398
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:40,440
another possibility you could
call your friend, right,

399
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:48,030
or he's your friend until he
gives you the wrong answer,

400
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,410
which --

401
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:57,010
that turned out subspaces,
then A is some multiple of B.

402
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:01,840
to be very unreliable,
you know, you'd

403
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,990
call up your
brother or something

404
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:12,200
and ask him for the capital
of whatever, Bosnia.

405
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,940
What does he know,
he makes some guess,

406
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:29,560
So what -- I would just take
extreme cases if it was me,

407
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,602
matrix, independent columns,
is Ax=b always solvable?

408
00:24:32,602 --> 00:24:33,810
Maybe just hands up for that?

409
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,310
A few.

410
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,420
And who says no?

411
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,730
Oh, gosh, this audience
is not reliable.

412
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,230
Fifty fifty.

413
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,070
I guess I'd say, I'd vote yes.

414
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:54,120
Because independent
columns, that

415
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,190
means that the rank
is the full size m,

416
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,890
I have a matrix of rank m.

417
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,530
That means it's --

418
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,710
I mean it's square, so
it's an invertible matrix,

419
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,330
and nothing could go wrong.

420
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,090
Yes.

421
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,070
So that's the good case and
we always expect it in chapter

422
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:18,130
two, but of course
chapter three is --

423
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:24,990
only one of the possibilities.

424
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,360
OK.

425
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:41,460
Let me move on to another
question from an old quiz.

426
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,840
OK.

427
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,210
OK.

428
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,960
Let's see.

429
00:25:46,960 --> 00:26:07,550
I'm going to give you a matrix,
but I'm going to give it to you

430
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,920
OK.

431
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:19,910
as a product of a
couple of matrices,

432
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:32,260
one, one, zero, zero,
one, zero, one, zero, one,

433
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:39,130
times another matrix, one, zero,

434
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:52,860
I would like to ask you
questions about that matrix

435
00:26:52,860 --> 00:27:07,960
minus one, two, zero, one,
one, minus one, and all zeroes.

436
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,330
OK.

437
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,070
Let's see, what
dimension I in --

438
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:17,210
the null space of B
is a subspace of R.

439
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,110
What size vectors
I looking for here?

440
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,124
Because if we don't
know the size,

441
00:27:24,124 --> 00:27:26,040
we aren't going to find
it, right? the null --

442
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:33,530
this matrix is three
by four obviously.

443
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,950
So if we're looking for the null
space we're looking for those

444
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,870
vectors x in R^4.

445
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,830
OK.

446
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:45,490
So the null space of B is
certainly a subspace of R^4.

447
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,490
What do you think
its dimension is?

448
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,930
Of course once we
find the basis we

449
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,010
would know the dimension
immediately, but let's

450
00:27:55,010 --> 00:28:00,590
stop first, what's the
rank of this matrix B?

451
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:05,010
Let's see, what -- is
that matrix invertible,

452
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,306
that square one there?

453
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:15,110
Let's say sure, I
think it is, yes,

454
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,330
that matrix B looks invertible.

455
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:21,230
Is that pretty clear?

456
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,090
Yeah.

457
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,180
Yeah.

458
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,450
So I've gone wrong in
this course already,

459
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:33,210
but I'll still hope that
that matrix is invertible.

460
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,650
Yeah, yeah, because if I look
for a combination of those

461
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:41,600
three columns -- well, I
couldn't use this middle column

462
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,890
because it would have a one
and in a position that I --

463
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:51,370
column is otherwise all zero,
so a combination that gives zero

464
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:56,180
can't give us that problem, and
then the other two are clearly

465
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,090
independent sets -- so
that matrix is invertible.

466
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:03,600
Later we could take a
determinant or other things.

467
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,100
OK.

468
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,500
What's the setup?

469
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,850
If I have an invertible matrix,
a nice invertible square

470
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,620
matrix, times this guy,
times this second factor,

471
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,840
and I'm looking
for the null space,

472
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,305
does this have any effect?

473
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,490
Is the null -- so what I'm
asking is is the null space

474
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:33,500
of B the same as the null
space of just this part?

475
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,950
I think so.

476
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,820
I think so.

477
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,470
If Bx is zero, then
multiplying by that guy

478
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,870
I'll still have zero.

479
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:47,970
But also if this times
some x give zero,

480
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,550
I could always multiply on the
left by the inverse of that,

481
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,100
because it is invertible,
and I would discover

482
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,040
that this kind of Bx is zero.

483
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,700
You want me to write
some of that down --

484
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,730
if I have a product
here, C times --

485
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:14,040
times D, say, and
if C is invertible,

486
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,660
the null space of CD,
well, it will the same

487
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,880
as the null space of D.

488
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,770
If C is invertible.

489
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,570
Multiplying by an invertible
matrix on the left

490
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,520
can't change the null space.

491
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,050
OK.

492
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,550
So basically I'm asking you
for the null space of this.

493
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,920
so when do I know -- well, I
would say suppose the matrix

494
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,540
I don't have to do
the multiplication

495
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,210
because I have C is invertible.

496
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,220
That first factor
C is invertible.

497
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,550
It's not going to
change the null space.

498
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,320
OK.

499
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:55,430
So can we just write down a
basis now for the null space?

500
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:59,060
So what's the basis for the
null space of -- of that?

501
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:06,080
So basis for the null space
I'm looking for the two --

502
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,330
there are two pivot
columns obviously.

503
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,200
It clearly has rank two.

504
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,450
If -- so true or false, if
A and B have the same four

505
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,070
I'm looking for the
two special solutions.

506
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,070
They'll come from the
third and the fourth.

507
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,200
The free variables.

508
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,940
OK. so if the third
free variable is a one,

509
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,690
then I think probably I
need a minus one there

510
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,320
and a one there, it looks like.

511
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,690
Do you agree that if I then do
that multiplication I'll get

512
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,190
zero?

513
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,940
And if I have one in the
fourth variable, then

514
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:46,190
maybe I need a one in the second
variable and maybe a minus two

515
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,970
in the third.

516
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,310
So I just reasoned that through
and then if I look back I see

517
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:55,450
sure enough that the free
variable part that I sometimes

518
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,410
call F, that up --
that two by two corner,

519
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:06,250
is sitting here with
all its signs reversed.

520
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,720
So that's -- here
I'm seeing minus F,

521
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,110
and here I'm seeing the identity
in the null space matrix.

522
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,460
OK, so that's the null space.

523
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:23,980
Another question is solve
Bx equal one, zero, one.

524
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,190
OK.

525
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:34,890
So that's one question, now
solve complete solutions.

526
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:39,090
To Bx equal one, zero, one.

527
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,200
OK.

528
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,020
Yeah, so I guess I'm
seeing if I wanted

529
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:54,790
to get one, zero, one - What's
our particular solution?

530
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,460
So I'm looking for a
particular solution

531
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,720
and then the null space

532
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,390
part.

533
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,090
OK.

534
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:05,360
I-- actually the
first column of B,

535
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,840
so what's the first
column of our matrix B?

536
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,770
It's the vector one, zero, one.

537
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:14,140
The first column of
our matrix agrees

538
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,430
with the right-hand side.

539
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,670
So I guess I'm
thinking x particular

540
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:22,570
plus x null space will be
the particular solution,

541
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:27,814
since the first column of B is
exactly right, that's great.

542
00:33:27,814 --> 00:33:29,980
And then I have C times
that first null space vector

543
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:37,881
and D times the other
null space vector.

544
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:38,380
Right?

545
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,700
The two -- the null space
part of the solution,

546
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:48,060
as always has the
arbitrary constants,

547
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,380
the particular solution doesn't
have any arbitrary constants,

548
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,840
it's one particular solution,
and in this case it'll --

549
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,160
that one would do.

550
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,070
OK.

551
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,750
Fine.

552
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:03,030
so those are questions
taken from old quizzes,

553
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:09,781
any questions coming to mind?

554
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:10,280
Yeah.

555
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,780
Q: value.

556
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,300
OK.

557
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,000
Well, so that
particular x particular,

558
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,330
it says that let's see,
when I multiply by this guy,

559
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:26,850
I'm going to get the
first column of B.

560
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,050
That -- if that's a
solution, I multiply B,

561
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,060
B times this x will be
the first column of B,

562
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:39,480
and so I'm saying that the first
column of this B agrees with

563
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,300
the right-hand side.

564
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:47,340
So I'm saying that look at the
first column of that matrix B.

565
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,780
If you do the
multiplication, it's --

566
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,659
so what's the first
column of that matrix?

567
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,370
Is that how you do
that multiplication?

568
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,203
I multiply that matrix
by that first column.

569
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:59,400
And it picks out one, zero, one.

570
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:11,020
So the first column
of B is exactly that.

571
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:18,650
And therefore a particular
solution will be this guy.

572
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,960
So I'll repeat that question.

573
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,150
Yeah.

574
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:21,650
OK.

575
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,150
Yes.

576
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,170
Q: particular solution.

577
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,320
Any of the solutions can
be the particular one

578
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,180
that we pick out.

579
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,940
So like this plus -- plus this
would be another particular

580
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,610
OK.

581
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,110
solution.

582
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:48,260
It would be another solution.

583
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:53,040
The particular is just
telling us only take one.

584
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,370
But it's not telling us
which one we have to take.

585
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,850
We take the most convenient one.

586
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:02,560
I guess in this -- in this
problem that was that one.

587
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,480
Good.

588
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,750
Other questions?

589
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,250
Yes.

590
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,550
And this pattern
of particular plus

591
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:15,370
null space, of course, that's
going throughout mathematics

592
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,770
of linear systems.

593
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,970
We're really doing mathematics
of linear systems here.

594
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,070
Our systems are discrete and
they're finite-dimensional --

595
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:31,860
and so it's linear algebra, but
this particular plus null space

596
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:37,850
goes -- that doesn't depend
on having finite matrices --

597
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:42,990
that spreads much --
that spreads everywhere.

598
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,280
OK, I'm going to just
like to encourage

599
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,370
you to take problems
out of the book,

600
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,250
let me do the same myself.

601
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,160
OK well here's some
easy true or falses.

602
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,440
I don't know why the
author put these in here.

603
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,530
OK.

604
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,720
If m=n, then the row space
equals the column space.

605
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,390
is invertible -- suppose
A is an invertible

606
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,790
So these are true or falses.

607
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:13,230
If m equals n, so that
means the matrix is square,

608
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,410
then the row space
equals the column space?

609
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,760
False, good.

610
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,260
Good, what is equal there?

611
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:25,830
What can I say is
equal, if M -- well,

612
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,440
yeah.

613
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,610
Yeah it -- so that's
definitely false --

614
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,160
the row space and
the column space,

615
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:37,550
and this matrix is like always
a good example to consider.

616
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,530
So there's a square
matrix but it's row

617
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,200
space is the multiples
of zero, one,

618
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,310
and its column space is
the multiples of one, zero.

619
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,240
Very different.

620
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,680
The row space and
the column space

621
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,230
are totally different
for that matrix.

622
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,730
Now of course if the
matrix was symmetric,

623
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:01,780
well, then clearly the row
space equals the column space.

624
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,280
OK.

625
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,930
How about this question?

626
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,910
The matrices A and minus A
share the same four subspaces?

627
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,230
Do the matrices A and minus
A have the same column space,

628
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,100
do they have the
same null space,

629
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,480
do they have the same row

630
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,050
space?

631
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,960
What's the answer on that?

632
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:31,120
Yes or no.

633
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,620
Yes.

634
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,310
Good.

635
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,100
OK.

636
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,900
How about this?

637
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:40,020
If A and B have the
same four subspaces,

638
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,470
then A is a multiple of B.

639
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,261
If -- suppose those
subspaces are the same.

640
00:38:43,261 --> 00:38:44,680
Then is A a multiple of B?

641
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,510
OK.

642
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:53,000
How how do you answer
a question like that?

643
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,500
Of course if you want to
answer it yes, then I would --

644
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,460
then they'd have to
think of a reason why.

645
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,050
If you want to answer no
way, then you would --

646
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:06,410
and I would sort of like
first I would try to think no,

647
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,540
I would say can I come up with
an example where it isn't true?

648
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:17,680
Let me repeat the question.

649
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:24,810
And then write the answer.

650
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:30,520
matrix, then what --

651
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:40,510
suppose it's six by
six invertible matrix,

652
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:59,070
then what's its row space, and
its column space is all of R^6,

653
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:17,620
and the null space, and the null
space of A transpose would be

654
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,900
the zero vector.

655
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:36,170
So every invertible matrix
is going to give that answer.

656
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:49,020
If I have a six by
six invertible matrix,

657
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,602
I know what those subspaces are.

658
00:40:51,602 --> 00:40:53,060
Heck, that was back
in chapter two,

659
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,720
when I didn't even know
what subspaces were.

660
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:01,890
The row space and column space
are both all six-dimensional

661
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,470
space -- the whole space,
and the rank is six,

662
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:10,280
in other words, and the null
spaces have zero dimension.

663
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,870
So do you see now the answer?

664
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,060
So A and B could be.

665
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,970
So A and B could be for example
any -- so I'm going to say

666
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:17,470
false.

667
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:21,070
Because A and B for example --

668
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:34,230
So an example: A and B any
invertible six by six, six

669
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,730
by six.

670
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:39,230
So those would have
the same four subspaces

671
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,480
but they wouldn't be the same.

672
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,890
Of course th- there should be
something about those matrices

673
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:45,930
that would be the same.

674
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:50,070
It's sort of a natural
problem, so now actually we're

675
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,120
getting to a math question.

676
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,390
The answer is this is not true.

677
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:59,300
One matrix doesn't have to
be a multiple of the other.

678
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,420
But there must be
something that's true.

679
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:07,770
And that would be sort of like
a natural question to ask.

680
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:15,850
If they have the same
subspaces, same four subspaces,

681
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:29,700
then what -- what could you --

682
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,480
instinct wasn't
necessarily right.

683
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,700
But I hope you now see that
the correct answer is false.

684
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,550
And then you might think
OK, well, they certainly

685
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,530
do have the same rank.

686
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:51,860
But do -- obviously if they
have the same four subspaces,

687
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,460
they have the same rank.

688
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:58,620
I might say if
they have the well,

689
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:03,820
I could extend that question and
think about other possibilities

690
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:08,500
and finally come up with
something that was true.

691
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,620
But I won't press that one.

692
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:15,270
Let me keep going with
practice questions.

693
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:19,430
And these practice questions
are quite appropriate I

694
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,510
think for the exam.

695
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,030
OK.

696
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,070
let's see.

697
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:29,310
If I exchange two rows of A
which subspaces stay the same?

698
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,950
So I'm trying to
take out questions

699
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:38,670
that we can answer without you
know we can answer quickly.

700
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:45,560
If I have a matrix A, and I
exchange two of its rows, which

701
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,570
subspaces stay the same?

702
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:50,560
The row space does
stay the same.

703
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,440
And the null space
stays the same.

704
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,270
Good.

705
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,200
Good.

706
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,690
Correct.

707
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,170
Column space would
be a wrong answer.

708
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,280
OK.

709
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,140
all right, here's a question.

710
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,730
Oh, this leads into
the next chapter.

711
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,990
Why can the vector
one, two, three not

712
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:12,280
be a row and also
in the null space?

713
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,040
Fitting we close
with this question.

714
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,860
Close is -- so V
equal this one, two,

715
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:33,900
three can't be in the null space
of a matrix and the row space.

716
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:40,690
And my question is why not?

717
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:41,378
Why not?

718
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,950
So this is a
question that we can

719
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:51,360
because it's sort of asked
in a straightforward way,

720
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,410
we can figure out an answer.

721
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,460
Well, actually yeah --

722
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,550
I'll even pin it down, it
can't be in the null space --

723
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:04,420
and be a row.

724
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:07,050
I'll even pin it down further.

725
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:12,550
Ask it to be a row of A.

726
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:15,000
Why not?

727
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,820
So I'm -- we know the
dimensions of these spaces.

728
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:26,330
But now I'm asking you sort
of like the overlap between --

729
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:30,320
so the null space
and the row space,

730
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,210
those are in the same
n-dimensional space.

731
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:41,410
Those are -- well, those are
both subspaces of n-dimensional

732
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:45,060
space, and I'm basically
saying they can't overlap.

733
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:49,040
I can't have a vector like
this, a typical vector, that's

734
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,110
in the null space and it's
also a row of the matrix.

735
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,580
Why is that?

736
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,350
So that's a new sort of idea.

737
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:58,320
Let's just see
what it would mean.

738
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:04,860
I mean that A times this V,
why can this A times this

739
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,770
V it can't be zero.

740
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:12,410
Oh well, if it's
zero, so this is --

741
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:16,830
I'm getting it into
the null space here.

742
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:20,750
So this is -- now let's put
that vector's in the null space,

743
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:27,600
why can't the first row of
a matrix be one, two, three?

744
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:35,470
I can fill out the
matrix as I like.

745
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:37,010
Why is that impossible?

746
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,310
Well, you're seeing
it's impossible, right?

747
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:44,690
That if that was a row of the
matrix and in the null space,

748
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:48,421
that number would not be
zero, it would be fourteen.

749
00:46:48,421 --> 00:46:48,920
Right.

750
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,960
So now we actually are beginning
to get a more complete picture

751
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,170
of these four subspaces.

752
00:46:55,170 --> 00:47:00,220
The two that are over
in n-dimensional space,

753
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:04,450
they actually only
share the zero vector.

754
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:08,110
The intersection of the
null space and the row space

755
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:09,310
is only the zero vector.

756
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:14,970
And in fact the null space is
perpendicular to the row space.

757
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:18,920
That'll be the first
topic let's see,

758
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,940
we have a holiday Monday --

759
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:29,800
and I'll see you Wednesday
with perpendiculars.

760
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,980
And I'll see you Friday.

761
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:39,710
So good luck on the quiz.
