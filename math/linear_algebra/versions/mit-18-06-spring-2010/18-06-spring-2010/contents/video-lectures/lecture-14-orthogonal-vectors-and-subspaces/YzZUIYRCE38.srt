1
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:12,325
OK.

2
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,900
cameras are rolling.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,840
This is lecture fourteen,
starting a new chapter.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,660
Chapter about orthogonality.

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,480
What it means for
vectors to be orthogonal.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,070
What it means for
subspaces to be orthogonal.

7
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,370
What it means for
bases to be orthogonal.

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:44,460
So ninety degrees, this is
a ninety-degree chapter.

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,800
So what does it mean --

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,890
let me jump to subspaces.

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,830
Because I've drawn
here the big picture.

12
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,910
This is the 18.06 picture here.

13
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,800
And hold it down, guys.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,280
So this is the picture and we
know a lot about that picture

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,550
already.

16
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,570
We know the dimension
of every subspace.

17
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:22,040
We know that these
dimensions are r and n-r.

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,320
We know that these
dimensions are r and m-r.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,780
What I want to show now is
what this figure is saying,

20
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,140
that the angle --

21
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:43,520
the figure is just my attempt to
draw what I'm now going to say,

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,510
that the angle between these
subspaces is ninety degrees.

23
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,890
And the angle between these
subspaces is ninety degrees.

24
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,670
Now I have to say
what does that mean?

25
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:01,080
What does it mean for
subspaces to be orthogonal?

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,540
But I hope you appreciate
the beauty of this picture,

27
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,340
that that those
subspaces are going

28
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,170
to come out to be orthogonal.

29
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,140
Those two and also those two.

30
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:24,870
So that's like one point,
one important point

31
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,960
to step forward in
understanding those subspaces.

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,140
We knew what each
subspace was like,

33
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,500
we could compute bases for them.

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,440
Now we know more.

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,240
Or we will in a few minutes.

36
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,750
OK.

37
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,110
I have to say first of all what
does it mean for two vectors

38
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,920
to be orthogonal?

39
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,470
So let me start with that.

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Orthogonal vectors.

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,610
The word orthogonal is
-- is just another word

42
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,620
for perpendicular.

43
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,510
It means that in
n-dimensional space

44
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,290
the angle between those
vectors is ninety degrees.

45
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,480
It means that they
form a right triangle.

46
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,940
It even means that the going
way back to the Greeks that this

47
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:29,010
angle that this triangle
a vector x, a vector x,

48
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,560
and a vector x+y -- of course
that'll be the hypotenuse,

49
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,750
so what was it the Greeks
figured out and it's neat.

50
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,860
It's the fact that the --

51
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,980
so these are orthogonal,
this is a right angle, if --

52
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:57,660
so let me put the great
name down, Pythagoras,

53
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,540
I'm looking for --
what I looking for?

54
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,980
I'm looking for the condition if
you give me two vectors, how do

55
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,540
I know if they're orthogonal?

56
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,490
How can I tell two
perpendicular vectors?

57
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,830
And actually you
probably know the answer.

58
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,770
Let me write the answer down.

59
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,550
Orthogonal vectors, what's
the test for orthogonality?

60
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:29,430
I take the dot product which I
tend to write as x transpose y,

61
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,060
because that's a
row times a column,

62
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,390
and that matrix multiplication
just gives me the right thing,

63
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:45,340
that x1y1+x2y2 and so on, so
these vectors are orthogonal

64
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:52,560
if this result x
transpose y is zero.

65
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,130
That's the test.

66
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,340
OK.

67
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,850
Can I connect that
to other things?

68
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,480
I mean -- it's just beautiful
that here we have we're in n

69
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,390
dimensions, we've got
a couple of vectors,

70
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,620
we want to know the
angle between them,

71
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,750
and the right thing to look at
is the simplest thing that you

72
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,930
could imagine, the dot product.

73
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,600
OK.

74
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,890
Now why?

75
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,430
So I'm answering the
question now why --

76
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:33,500
let's add some justification
to this fact, that's the test.

77
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,050
OK, so Pythagoras would say
we've got a right triangle,

78
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,400
if that length squared plus
that length squared equals

79
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,170
that length squared.

80
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:51,800
OK, can I write it as x
squared plus y squared equals

81
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,890
x plus y squared?

82
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,120
Now don't, please don't think
that this is always true.

83
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,360
This is only going
to be true in this --

84
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,600
it's going to be equivalent
to orthogonality.

85
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,180
For other triangles of
course, it's not true.

86
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,540
For other triangles it's not.

87
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,860
But for a right triangle
somehow that fact

88
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,810
should connect to that fact.

89
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,240
Can we just make
that connection?

90
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,090
What's the connection between
this test for orthogonality

91
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,040
and this statement
of orthogonality?

92
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,520
Well, I guess I have to say
what is the length squared?

93
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,370
So let's continue on the board
underneath with that equation.

94
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,800
Give me another way to express
the length squared of a vector.

95
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,960
And let me just
give you a vector.

96
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,420
The vector one, two, three.

97
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,730
That's in three dimensions.

98
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,720
What is the length squared of
the vector x equal one, two,

99
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,410
three?

100
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,820
So how do you find
the length squared?

101
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,710
Well, really you just, you want
the length of that vector that

102
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,220
goes along one -- up
two, and out three --

103
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,910
and we'll come back to
that right triangle stuff.

104
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,928
The length squared is
exactly x transpose x.

105
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,230
Whenever I see x
transpose x, I know

106
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,040
I've got a number
that's positive.

107
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,750
It's a length
squared unless it --

108
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,440
unless x happens to
be the zero vector,

109
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,500
that's the one case
where the length is zero.

110
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,770
So right -- this is just x1
squared plus x2 squared plus

111
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,920
so on, plus xn squared.

112
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,830
So one -- in the example I gave
you what was the length squared

113
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,230
of that vector one, two, three?

114
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,070
So you square those, you
get one, four and nine,

115
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,310
you add, you get fourteen.

116
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,590
So the vector one, two,
three has length fourteen.

117
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,000
So let me just put
down a vector here.

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,995
Let x be the vector
one, two, three.

119
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,060
Let me cook up a vector
that's orthogonal to it.

120
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,590
So what's the vector
that's orthogonal?

121
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:33,270
So right down here, x squared
is one plus four plus nine,

122
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:38,480
fourteen, let me cook up a
vector that's orthogonal to it,

123
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:47,170
we'll get right that that
-- those two vectors are

124
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:55,320
orthogonal, the length
of y squared is five,

125
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:02,520
and x plus y is one
and two making three,

126
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,290
two and minus one making one,
three and zero making three,

127
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:13,010
and the length of this squared
is nine plus one plus nine,

128
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,700
nineteen.

129
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,810
And sure enough, I
haven't proved anything.

130
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:28,900
I've just like checked to
see that my test x transpose

131
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,530
y equals zero, which
is true, right?

132
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,370
Everybody sees that x
transpose y is zero here?

133
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,740
That's maybe the main point.

134
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,910
That you should get really
quick at doing x transpose y,

135
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,980
so it's just this plus this
plus this and that's zero.

136
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,730
And sure enough, that clicks
with fourteen plus five

137
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,190
agreeing with nineteen.

138
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,780
Now let me just do
that in letters.

139
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:01,110
So that's y transpose y.

140
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:08,150
And this is x plus y
transpose x plus y.

141
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,290
OK.

142
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,530
So I'm looking, again,
this isn't always true.

143
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,110
I repeat.

144
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,020
This is going to be true
when we have a right angle.

145
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,210
And let's just --
well, of course,

146
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,850
I'm just going to
simplify this stuff here.

147
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,960
There's an x transpose x there.

148
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,850
And there's a y
transpose y there.

149
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,450
And there's an x transpose y.

150
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,610
And there's a y transpose x.

151
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,990
I knew I could do that
simplification because I'm just

152
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,150
doing matrix multiplication and
I've just followed the rules.

153
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,880
OK.

154
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,650
So x transpose x-s cancel.

155
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,910
Y transpose y-s cancel.

156
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,950
And what about these guys?

157
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:03,400
What can you tell me about
the inner product of x with y

158
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,890
and the inner
product of y with x?

159
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,620
Is there a difference?

160
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,150
I think if we -- while
we're doing real vectors,

161
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,310
which is all we're doing now,
there isn't a difference,

162
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,660
there's no difference.

163
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,690
If I take x transpose
y, that'll give me zero,

164
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,840
if I took y transpose x I would
have the same x1y1 and x2y2

165
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:35,280
and x3y3, it would be
the same, so this is --

166
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,820
this is the same as
that, this is really

167
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,070
I'll knock that guy out
and say two of these.

168
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,360
So actually that's the --

169
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,960
this equation boiled down
to this thing being zero.

170
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,670
Right?

171
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,010
Everything else canceled
and this equation

172
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,250
boiled down to that one.

173
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,450
So that's really all I wanted.

174
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:08,170
I just wanted to check that
Pythagoras for a right triangle

175
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,250
led me to this -- of course
I cancel the two now.

176
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,680
No problem.

177
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,880
To x transpose y equals
zero as the test.

178
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,610
Fair enough.

179
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,190
OK.

180
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,150
You knew it was coming.

181
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,010
The dot product of
orthogonal vectors is zero.

182
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,010
It's just -- I just want
to say that's really neat.

183
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,760
That it comes out so well.

184
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,830
All right.

185
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,760
Now what about -- so
now I know if two --

186
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,700
when two vectors are orthogonal.

187
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,860
By the way, what about if one of
these guys is the zero vector?

188
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,660
Suppose x is the zero
vector, and y is whatever.

189
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,010
Are they orthogonal?

190
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,190
Sure.

191
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,310
In math the one thing
about math is you're

192
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,910
supposed to follow the rules.

193
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,450
So you're supposed to --
if x is the zero vector,

194
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,330
you're supposed to take the
zero vector dotted with y

195
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,180
and of course you
always get zero.

196
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,340
So just so we're all
sure, the zero vector

197
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,730
is orthogonal to everybody.

198
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,770
But what I want to --

199
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:32,240
what I now want to think
about is subspaces.

200
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,530
What does it mean for me to
say that some subspace is

201
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,320
orthogonal to some
other subspace?

202
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,110
So OK.

203
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,590
Now I've got to write this down.

204
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:47,960
So because we're defining
definition of subspace

205
00:13:47,960 --> 00:14:02,390
S is orthogonal so to
subspace let's say T,

206
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,130
so I've got a
couple of subspaces.

207
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,480
And what should it mean for
those guys to be orthogonal?

208
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,780
It's just sort of what's
the natural extension

209
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,990
from orthogonal vectors
to orthogonal subspaces?

210
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:26,820
Well, and in
particular, let's think

211
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:34,410
of some orthogonal
subspaces, like this wall.

212
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,300
Let's say in three dimensions.

213
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,320
So the blackboard extended
to infinity, right, is a --

214
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,950
is a subspace, a plane, a
two-dimensional subspace.

215
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,310
It's a little bumpy
but anyway, it's a --

216
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:57,001
think of it as a subspace, let
me take the floor as another

217
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:57,500
subspace.

218
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:07,840
Again, it's not
a great subspace,

219
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:15,400
MIT only built it
like so-so, but I'll

220
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,840
put the origin right here.

221
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,040
So the origin of the
world is right there.

222
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,540
OK.

223
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,340
Thereby giving linear algebra
its proper importance in this.

224
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,190
OK.

225
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,290
So there is one subspace,
there's another one.

226
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,940
The floor.

227
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:42,200
And are they orthogonal?

228
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,130
What does it mean
for two subspaces

229
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,460
to be orthogonal and
in that special case

230
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,650
are they orthogonal?

231
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,290
All right.

232
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,950
Let's finish this sentence.

233
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:58,501
What does it mean
means we have to know

234
00:15:58,501 --> 00:15:59,500
what we're talking about

235
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,040
here.

236
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,310
So what would be a reasonable
idea of orthogonal?

237
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,740
Well, let me put
the right thing up.

238
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:17,930
It means that every vector
in S, every vector in S,

239
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:23,565
is orthogonal to --

240
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,080
what I going to say?

241
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:38,000
Every vector in T.

242
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,990
That's a reasonable
and it's a good

243
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,560
and it's the right
definition for two subspaces

244
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,010
to be orthogonal.

245
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,740
But I just want you to see,
hey, what does that mean?

246
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,620
So answer the
question about the --

247
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,440
the blackboard and the floor.

248
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Are those two subspaces,
they're two-dimensional, right,

249
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,830
and we're in R^3.

250
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:09,665
It's like a xz plane or
something and a xy plane.

251
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:17,109
Are they orthogonal?

252
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,560
Is every vector in the
blackboard orthogonal

253
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,349
to every vector in the floor,
starting from the origin

254
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,140
right there?

255
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,900
Yes or no?

256
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,010
I could take a vote.

257
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,040
Well we get some
yeses and some noes.

258
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,170
No is the answer.

259
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,810
They're not.

260
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,340
You can tell me a
vector in the blackboard

261
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,995
and a vector in the floor
that are not orthogonal.

262
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,960
Well you can tell me
quite a few, I guess.

263
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,140
Maybe like I could take
some forty-five-degree guy

264
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:05,730
in the blackboard, and
something in the floor,

265
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,580
they're not at ninety
degrees, right?

266
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,780
In fact, even more,
you could tell me

267
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:17,140
a vector that's in both the
blackboard plane and the floor

268
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,550
plane, so it's certainly
not orthogonal to itself.

269
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,600
So for sure, those two
planes aren't orthogonal.

270
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,950
What would that be?

271
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,350
So what's a vector that's --

272
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,320
in both of those planes?

273
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,170
It's this guy running
along the crack

274
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:39,540
there, in the intersection,
the intersection.

275
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,360
A vector, you know --

276
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,460
if two subspaces meet at some
vector, well then for sure

277
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,170
they're not orthogonal,
because that vector is in one

278
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,240
and it's in the other, and
it's not orthogonal to itself

279
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,770
unless it's zero.

280
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:01,000
So the only I mean
so orthogonal is

281
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,220
for me to say these two
subspaces are orthogonal first

282
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,080
of all I'm certainly saying
that they don't intersect

283
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,550
in any nonzero vector.

284
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,430
But also I mean more than
that just not intersecting

285
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:18,990
isn't good

286
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,490
enough.

287
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:26,150
So give me an example, oh,
let's say in the plane, oh well,

288
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:30,090
when do we have orthogonal
subspaces in the plane?

289
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,100
Yeah, tell me in the
plane, so we don't --

290
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,960
there aren't that many different
subspaces in the plane.

291
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,385
What what have we got in the
plane as possible subspaces?

292
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,420
The zero vector, real small.

293
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,330
A line through the origin.

294
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,570
Or the whole plane.

295
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,420
OK.

296
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,769
Now so when is a line
through the origin orthogonal

297
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:56,560
to the whole plane?

298
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,070
Never, right, never.

299
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,620
When is a line through the
origin orthogonal to the zero

300
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,120
subspace?

301
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,180
Always.

302
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,910
Right.

303
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,480
When is a line through
the origin orthogonal

304
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,920
to a different line
through the origin?

305
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,880
Well, that's the case that
we all have a clear picture

306
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,070
of, they --

307
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,610
the two lines have to
meet at ninety degrees.

308
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,340
They have only the -- so
that's like this simple case

309
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,090
I'm talking about.

310
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,970
There's one subspace,
there's the other subspace.

311
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,770
They only meet at zero.

312
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,570
And they're orthogonal.

313
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,340
OK.

314
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,930
Now.

315
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:43,540
So we now know what it means for
two subspaces to be orthogonal.

316
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,240
And now I want to say that
this is true for the row

317
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,080
space and the null space.

318
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,740
OK.

319
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,880
So that's the neat fact.

320
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:05,720
So row space is orthogonal
to the null space.

321
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,435
Now how did I come up with that?

322
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,500
But you see the rank it's
great, that means that these --

323
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,020
that these subspaces are
just the right things,

324
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,220
they're just cutting
the whole space up

325
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,560
into two perpendicular
subspaces.

326
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,060
OK.

327
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,560
So why?

328
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,040
Well, what have I
got to work with?

329
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,230
All I know is the null space.

330
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,360
The null space has vectors
that solve Ax equals zero.

331
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,780
So this is a guy x.

332
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,940
x is in the null space.

333
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,350
Then Ax is zero.

334
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:03,250
So why is it orthogonal
to the rows of A?

335
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,340
If I write down Ax
equals zero, which

336
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,720
is all I know about
the null space,

337
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,130
then I guess I want you to
see that that's telling me,

338
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,430
just that equation right
there is telling me

339
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,670
that the rows of A,
let me write it out.

340
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:24,000
There's row one of A.

341
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,540
Row two.

342
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:32,300
Row m of A. that's A.

343
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,530
And it's multiplying X.

344
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,560
And it's producing zero.

345
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,060
OK.

346
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:47,200
Written out that
way you'll see it.

347
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,200
So I'm saying that a
vector in the row space

348
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,250
is perpendicular to this
guy X in the null space.

349
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,310
And you see why?

350
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,550
Because this equation
is telling you

351
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:06,330
that row one of A multiplying
that's a dot product, right?

352
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,480
Row one of A dot product with
this x is producing this zero.

353
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,970
So x is orthogonal
to the first row.

354
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,670
And to the second row.

355
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,630
Row two of A, x is
giving that zero.

356
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,590
Row m of A times x
is giving that zero.

357
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,020
So x is --

358
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,380
the equation is
telling me that x

359
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,309
is orthogonal to all the rows.

360
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,600
Right, it's just sitting there.

361
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,380
That's all we -- it had to
be sitting there because we

362
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,000
didn't know anything more
about the null space than this.

363
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,120
And now I guess to be
totally complete here

364
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,350
I'd now check that
x is orthogonal

365
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,720
to each separate row.

366
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,710
But what else strictly
speaking do I have to do?

367
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,340
To show that those
subspaces are orthogonal,

368
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,580
I have to take this x in
the null space and show that

369
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,380
it's orthogonal to every
vector in the row space,

370
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,740
every vector in the
row space, so what --

371
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,330
what else is in the row space?

372
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,970
This row is in the row space,
that row is in the row space,

373
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,870
they're all there, but it's
not the whole row space,

374
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,990
right, we just have to
like remember, what does it

375
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:29,610
mean, what does that
word space telling us?

376
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:34,470
And what else is
in the row space?

377
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,810
Besides the rows?

378
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,990
All their combinations.

379
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,680
So I really have to
check that sure enough

380
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,770
if x is perpendicular
to row one,

381
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,720
row two, all the
different separate rows,

382
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,110
then also x is perpendicular
to a combination of the rows.

383
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,000
And that's just matrix
multiplication again.

384
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,300
You know, I have row
one transpose x is zero,

385
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:11,000
so on, row two
transpose x is zero,

386
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,800
so I'm entitled to multiply that
by some c1, this by some c2,

387
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,700
I still have zeroes,
I'm entitled to add,

388
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,760
so I have c1 row one so --
so all this when I put that

389
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:33,290
together that's big parentheses
c1 row one plus c2 row two

390
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,780
and so on.

391
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,220
Transpose x is zero.

392
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:38,720
Right?

393
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,380
I just added the
zeroes and got zero,

394
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,760
and I just added these
following the rule.

395
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,490
No big deal.

396
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,890
The whole point was
right sitting in that.

397
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,610
OK.

398
00:25:54,610 --> 00:26:02,480
So if I come back to this figure
now I'm like a happier person.

399
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,090
Because I have this --

400
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:10,730
I now see how those
subspaces are oriented.

401
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,090
And these subspaces
are also oriented.

402
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:20,200
Well, actually why is
that orthogonality?

403
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,660
Well, it's the same
statement for A transpose

404
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,330
that that one was for A.

405
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,670
So I won't take time
to prove it again

406
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:32,500
because we've checked
it for every matrix

407
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,960
and A transpose is just
as good a matrix as A.

408
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,520
So we're orthogonal over there.

409
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,180
So we really have
carved up this --

410
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,070
this was like carving
up m-dimensional space

411
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:56,070
into two subspaces and
this one was carving up

412
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:01,810
n-dimensional space
into two subspaces.

413
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,500
And well, one more thing here.

414
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,550
One more important thing.

415
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,330
Let me move into
three dimensions.

416
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:22,780
Tell me a couple of orthogonal
subspaces in three dimensions

417
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:27,450
that somehow don't carve
up the whole space,

418
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,330
there's stuff left there.

419
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,830
I'm thinking of a couple
of orthogonal lines.

420
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,550
If I -- suppose I'm in
three dimensions, R^3.

421
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:43,510
And I have one line, one
one-dimensional subspace,

422
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:46,030
and a perpendicular one.

423
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:51,170
Could those be the row
space and the null space?

424
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,590
Could those be the row
space and the null space?

425
00:27:54,590 --> 00:28:00,520
Could I be in three
dimensions and have

426
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:05,930
a row space that's a line and
a null space that's a line?

427
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,270
No.

428
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,180
Why not?

429
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,840
Because the dimensions
aren't right.

430
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,340
Right?

431
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,080
The dimensions are no good.

432
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,050
The dimensions here, r and
n-r, they add up to three,

433
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,490
they add up to n.

434
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,220
If I take --

435
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,800
just follow that example --

436
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,910
if the row space
is one-dimensional,

437
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:36,030
suppose A is what's
a good in R^3,

438
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,560
I want a one-dimensional row
space, let me take one, two,

439
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,470
five, two, four, ten.

440
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,330
What's the dimension
of that row space?

441
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,220
One.

442
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,260
What's the dimension
of the null space?

443
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,130
Tell what's the null space
look like in that case?

444
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,670
The row space is a line, right?

445
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:06,440
One-dimensional, it's just a
line through one, two, five.

446
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,370
Geometrically what's
the row space look like?

447
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,660
What's its dimension?

448
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,920
So here r here n
is three, the rank

449
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,610
is one, so the dimension
of the null space,

450
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:32,180
so I'm looking at
this x, x1, x2, x3.

451
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,680
To give zero.

452
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:43,300
So the dimension of the null
space is we all know is two.

453
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:43,800
Right.

454
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,440
It's a plane.

455
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,770
And now actually we know, we
see better, what plane is it?

456
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,660
What plane is it?

457
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:57,500
It's the plane that's
perpendicular to one,

458
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,950
two, five.

459
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,450
Right?

460
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,350
We now see.

461
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,710
In fact the two, four,
ten didn't actually

462
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,000
have any effect at all.

463
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,750
I could have just ignored that.

464
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:14,340
That didn't change the row
space or the null space.

465
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,051
I'll just make
that one equation.

466
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:17,550
Yeah.

467
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,000
OK.

468
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,499
Sure.

469
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:21,210
That's the easiest to deal with.

470
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,130
One equation.

471
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,440
Three unknowns.

472
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:32,670
And I want to ask --

473
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:37,180
what would the equation
give me the null space,

474
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,380
and you would have
said back in September

475
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,410
you would have said
it gives you a plane,

476
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,530
and we're completely right.

477
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,530
And the plane it gives
you, the normal vector,

478
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:53,610
you remember in calculus, there
was this dumb normal vector

479
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,760
called N.

480
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,496
Well there it is.

481
00:30:55,496 --> 00:30:56,120
One, two, five.

482
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,620
OK.

483
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:08,820
What is the what's the
point I want to make here?

484
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,010
I want to make --

485
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:14,300
I want to emphasize
that not only are the --

486
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,410
let me write it in words.

487
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:33,900
So I want to write the null
space and the row space are

488
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:40,290
orthogonal, that's this
neat fact, which we've --

489
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:43,240
we've just checked
from Ax equals zero,

490
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,750
but now I want to say more
because there's a little more

491
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,190
that's true.

492
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:54,940
Their dimensions add
to the whole space.

493
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,660
So that's like a little
extra information.

494
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,860
That it's not like
I could have --

495
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,030
I couldn't have a line and
a line in three dimensions.

496
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:07,130
Those don't add up one and
one don't add to three.

497
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:17,820
So I used the word orthogonal
complements in R^n.

498
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,000
And the idea of
this word complement

499
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,720
is that the orthogonal
complement of a row space

500
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,950
contains not just some vectors
that are orthogonal to it,

501
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,400
but all.

502
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,050
So what does that mean?

503
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:42,260
That means that the null
space contains all, not just

504
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:51,270
some but all, vectors that are
perpendicular to the row space.

505
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,260
OK.

506
00:32:52,260 --> 00:33:04,190
Really what I've done in this
half of the lecture is just

507
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:09,100
notice some of the
nice geometry that --

508
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,030
that we didn't pick up before
because we didn't discuss

509
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,010
perpendicular vectors before.

510
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,800
But it was all sitting there.

511
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,440
And now we picked it up.

512
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,370
That these vectors are
orthogonal complements.

513
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,740
And I guess I even
call this part

514
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,730
one of the fundamental
theorem of linear algebra.

515
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:32,330
The fundamental theorem
of linear algebra

516
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:37,230
is about these four
subspaces, so part one

517
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,660
is about their dimension, maybe
I should call it part two now.

518
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,600
Their dimensions we got.

519
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,010
Now we're getting their
orthogonality, that's part two.

520
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:54,640
And part three will be
about bases for them.

521
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,290
Orthogonal bases.

522
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:00,520
So that's coming up.

523
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,570
OK.

524
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:10,870
So I'm happy with that
geometry right now.

525
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,980
OK.

526
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,949
OK.

527
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:16,239
Now what's my next
goal in this chapter?

528
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,087
Here's the main
problem of the chapter.

529
00:34:19,087 --> 00:34:21,420
The main problem of the chapter
is -- so this is coming.

530
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,378
It's coming attraction.

531
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:37,160
This is the very last
chapter that's about Ax=b.

532
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:48,690
I would like to solve
that system of equations

533
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,710
when there is no solution.

534
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,880
You may say what a
ridiculous thing to do.

535
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,670
But I have to say it's
done all the time.

536
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,440
In fact it has to be done.

537
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,510
You get -- so the
problem is solve --

538
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:20,626
the best possible solve I'll
put quote Ax=b when there is no

539
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:21,125
solution.

540
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,930
And of course what
does that mean?

541
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,550
b isn't in the column space.

542
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:35,720
And it's quite typical if this
matrix A is rectangular if I --

543
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,370
maybe I have m equations and
that's bigger than the number

544
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:47,840
of unknowns, then for
sure the rank is not m,

545
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,910
the rank couldn't be m now, so
there'll be a lot of right-hand

546
00:35:51,910 --> 00:36:00,300
sides with no solution,
but here's an example.

547
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,760
Some satellite is buzzing along.

548
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,196
You measure its position.

549
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:07,570
You make a thousand
measurements.

550
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:13,940
So that gives you a thousand
equations for the --

551
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:18,340
for the parameters that
-- that give the position.

552
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,350
But there aren't a
thousand parameters,

553
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,310
there's just maybe
six or something.

554
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,930
Or you're measuring the --
you're doing questionnaires.

555
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:36,210
You're measuring resistances.

556
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,650
You're taking pulses.

557
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,120
You're measuring
somebody's pulse rate.

558
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,190
There's just one unknown.

559
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:42,690
OK.

560
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,890
The pulse rate.

561
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,950
So you measure it
once, OK, fine,

562
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,510
but if you really
want to know it,

563
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:54,800
you measure it multiple times,
but then the measurements have

564
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,120
noise in them, so there's --

565
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,820
the problem is that
in many many problems

566
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,740
we've got too many
equations and they've got

567
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,240
noise in the right-hand side.

568
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:11,780
So Ax=b I can't expect to
solve it exactly right,

569
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,230
because I don't
even know what --

570
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:18,680
there's a measurement
mistake in b.

571
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,790
But there's information too.

572
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,120
There's a lot of information
about x in there.

573
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,070
And what I want to do is like
separate the noise, the junk,

574
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:33,860
from the information.

575
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,680
And so this is a straightforward
linear algebra problem.

576
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,600
How do I solve, what's
the best solution?

577
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
OK.

578
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,070
Now.

579
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:52,190
I want to say so that's
like describes the problem

580
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,010
in an algebraic way.

581
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:58,820
I got some equations, I'm
looking for the best solution.

582
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,020
Well, one way to find it
is -- one way to start,

583
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:09,580
one way to find a solution
is throw away equations until

584
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,340
you've got a nice, square
invertible system and solve

585
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,760
that.

586
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,620
That's not satisfactory.

587
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,410
There's no reason in
these measurements

588
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,300
to say these
measurements are perfect

589
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,970
and these measurements
are useless.

590
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,990
We want to use all
the measurements

591
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:32,140
to get the best information,
to get the maximum information.

592
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,170
But how?

593
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,390
OK.

594
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:40,020
Let me anticipate a matrix
that's going to show up.

595
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,720
This A is typically rectangular.

596
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,390
But a matrix that shows
up whenever you have --

597
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:52,260
and we chapter three was all
about rectangular matrices.

598
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,840
And we know when
this is solvable,

599
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,020
you could do elimination
on it, right?

600
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,600
But I'm thinking hey,
you do elimination

601
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,299
and you get equation zero
equal other non-zeroes.

602
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,590
I'm thinking we really --
elimination is going to fail.

603
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:05,630
So that's our question.

604
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,046
Elimination will
get us down to --

605
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,700
will tell us if there
is a solution or not.

606
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,600
But I'm now thinking not.

607
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,130
So what are we going to do?

608
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:24,720
OK.

609
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,320
All right.

610
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,810
I want to tell you to jump
ahead to the matrix that

611
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,310
will play a key role.

612
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,780
So this is the matrix that
you want to understand

613
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,950
for this chapter four.

614
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:47,740
And it's the matrix
A transpose A.

615
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:53,130
What's -- tell me some
things about that matrix.

616
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:58,640
So A is this m by n matrix,
rectangular, but now

617
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,100
I'm saying that the good
matrix that shows up in the end

618
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,130
is A transpose A.

619
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,120
So tell me something about that.

620
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:14,010
Is it -- what's the first thing
you know about A transpose A.

621
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,390
It's square.

622
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,780
Right?

623
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,740
Square because this is m
by n and this is n by m.

624
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,090
So this is the result is n by n.

625
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,240
Good.

626
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,230
Square.

627
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,990
What else?

628
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,970
It's symmetric.

629
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:29,535
Good.

630
00:40:29,535 --> 00:40:30,160
It's symmetric.

631
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,650
Because you remember
how to do that.

632
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:44,270
If we transpose that
matrix let's transpose it,

633
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,510
A transpose A, if
I transpose it,

634
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:55,230
then that comes first
transposed, this comes second,

635
00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:01,990
transposed, and then transposing
twice is leaves it --

636
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:05,100
brings it back to the
same so it's symmetric.

637
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,620
Good.

638
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:11,340
Now we now know how to
ask more about a matrix.

639
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:20,110
I'm interested in
is it invertible?

640
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,810
If not, what's its null space?

641
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,940
So I want to know about --
because you're going to see,

642
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:32,260
well, let me -- let me even,
well I shouldn't do this,

643
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,350
but I will.

644
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:37,460
Let me tell you what
equation to solve

645
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,300
when you can't solve that one.

646
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,450
The good equation comes
from multiplying both sides

647
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:53,150
by A transpose, so the good
equation that you get to

648
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,820
is this one.

649
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:00,790
A transpose Ax
equals A transpose b.

650
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,700
That will be the central
equation in the chapter.

651
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,950
So I think why not
tell it to you.

652
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,290
Why not admit it right away.

653
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,440
OK.

654
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,260
I have to --

655
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,960
I should really give x.

656
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:27,750
I want to sort of indicate that
this x isn't I mean this x was

657
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,580
the solution to that
equation if it existed,

658
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,440
but probably didn't.

659
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:39,020
Now let me give this a
different name, x hat.

660
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:45,740
Because I'm hoping this
one will have a solution.

661
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,680
And I'm saying that
it's my best solution.

662
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,400
I'll have to say
what does best mean.

663
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,720
But that's going to
be my -- my plan.

664
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,650
I'm going to say that the best
solution solves this equation.

665
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:03,770
So you see right away why I'm
so interested in this matrix

666
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,620
A transpose A.

667
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,130
And in its invertibility.

668
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:07,630
OK.

669
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,720
Now, when is it invertible?

670
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:14,900
OK.

671
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:22,040
Let me take a case, let me
just do an example and then --

672
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,910
I'll just pick a matrix here.

673
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:28,510
Just so we see what A
transpose A looks like.

674
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:35,010
So let me take a matrix A
one, one, one, one, two, five.

675
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,190
Just to invent a matrix.

676
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:40,600
So there's a matrix A.

677
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:48,390
Notice that it has M equal three
rows and N equal two columns.

678
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,950
Its rank is --

679
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:55,200
the rank of that matrix is two.

680
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,460
Right, yeah, the
columns are independent.

681
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,200
Does Ax equal b?

682
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:09,086
If I look at Ax=b, so x is
just x1 x2, and b is b1 b2 b3.

683
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,300
Do I expect to solve Ax=b?

684
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,760
What's -- no way, right?

685
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,440
I mean linear algebra's
great, but solving

686
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,040
three equations with
only two unknowns usually

687
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,020
we can't do it.

688
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:30,050
We can only solve it if
this vector is b is what?

689
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:37,780
I can solve that equation
if that vector b1 b2 b3

690
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:41,700
is in the column space.

691
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,650
If it's a combination of
those columns then fine.

692
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,030
But usually it won't be.

693
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:49,580
The combinations
just fill up a plane

694
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,780
and most vectors
aren't on that plane.

695
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:56,630
So what I'm saying is
that I'm going to work

696
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,990
with the matrix A transpose A.

697
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,600
And I just want to figure
out in this example what

698
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,780
A transpose A is.

699
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,390
So it's two by two.

700
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:13,320
The first entry is a three,
the next entry is an eight,

701
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,160
this entry is --

702
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,910
what's that entry?

703
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:23,110
Eight, for sure.

704
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:25,270
We knew it had to
be, and this entry

705
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:32,630
is, what's that now, getting out
my trusty calculator, thirty,

706
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,880
is that right?

707
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,580
And is that matrix invertible?

708
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,080
Thirty.

709
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,960
There's an A transpose A.

710
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,620
And it is invertible, right?

711
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,040
Three, eight is not a
multiple of eight, thirty --

712
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,050
and it's invertible.

713
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:51,420
And that's the normal,
that's what I expect.

714
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:56,730
So this is I want to show.

715
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,740
So here's the final --
here's the key point.

716
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:04,660
The null space of
A transpose A --

717
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,645
it's not going to be
always invertible.

718
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,450
Tell me a matrix --

719
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:15,640
I have to say that I can't
say A transpose A is always

720
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,770
invertible.

721
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,590
Because that's asking too much.

722
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,860
I mean what could the
matrix A be, for example,

723
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:27,330
so that A transpose
A was not invertible?

724
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,110
Well, it even could
be the zero matrix.

725
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:32,250
I mean that's like extreme case.

726
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:38,960
Suppose I make this rank --

727
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:46,090
suppose I change to that A.

728
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:49,240
Now I figure out A transpose
A again and I get --

729
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:49,840
what do I get?

730
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:58,360
I get nine, I get nine
of course and here I

731
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,434
get what's that entry?

732
00:47:02,434 --> 00:47:02,975
Twenty-seven.

733
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,100
And is that matrix invertible?

734
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:09,600
No.

735
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,470
And why do I --

736
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,590
I knew it wouldn't
be invertible anyway.

737
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:23,190
Because this matrix
only has rank one.

738
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:26,100
And if I have a product
of matrices of rank one,

739
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,340
the product is not going to
have a rank bigger than one.

740
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,810
So I'm not surprised that
the answer only has rank one.

741
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,730
And that's what I --

742
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:41,200
always happens, that the
rank of A transpose A

743
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,460
comes out to equal
the rank of A.

744
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:49,580
So, yes, so the null
space of A transpose A

745
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:57,580
equals the null space of A,
the rank of A transpose A

746
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,840
equals the rank of A.

747
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:11,460
So let's -- as soon as
I can why that's true.

748
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:18,920
But let's draw from that
what the fact that I want.

749
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:24,810
This tells me that this square
symmetric matrix is invertible

750
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,650
if --

751
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:30,460
so here's my conclusion.

752
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:40,400
A transpose A is invertible
if exactly when --

753
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,390
exactly if this null space
is only got the zero vector.

754
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:51,700
Which means the columns
of A are independent.

755
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,342
So A transpose A is
invertible exactly

756
00:48:54,342 --> 00:48:55,550
if A has independent columns.

757
00:48:55,550 --> 00:49:12,290
That's the fact that I
need about A transpose A.

758
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:17,160
And then you'll see next
time how A transpose A

759
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,780
enters everything.

760
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,130
Next lecture is
actually a crucial one.

761
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:26,280
Here I'm preparing
for it by getting us

762
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,000
thinking about A transpose A.

763
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,970
And its rank is the
same as the rank of A,

764
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,310
and we can decide
when it's invertible.

765
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:34,980
OK.

766
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,938
So I'll see you Friday.

767
00:49:35,938 --> 00:49:37,140
Thanks.
