1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,050
2 times this equation, Okay.

2
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,510
This is it.

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,360
The second lecture
in linear algebra,

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:25,860
and I've put below my
main topics for today.

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,270
I put right there a
system of equations

6
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,780
that's going to be our
example to work with.

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,150
But what are we
going to do with it?

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,540
We're going to solve it.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,900
And the method of solution
will not be determinants.

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,560
Determinants are something
that will come later.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,930
The method we'll use
is called elimination.

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:53,630
And it's the way every software
package solves equations.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,360
And elimination, well, if it
succeeds, it gets the answer.

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,870
And normally it does succeed.

15
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,790
If the matrix A that's
coming into that system

16
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,460
is a good matrix, and
I think this one is,

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,770
then elimination will work.

18
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,290
We'll get the answer
in an efficient way.

19
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,310
But why don't we, as long
as we're sort of seeing how

20
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,120
elimination works -- it's
always good to ask how could it

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,010
fail?

22
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,180
So at the same
time, we'll see how

23
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,570
elimination decides whether
the matrix is a good one

24
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,040
or has problems.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,030
Then to complete
the answer, there's

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,780
an obvious step of
back substitution.

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,600
In fact, the idea
of elimination is --

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,750
you would have
thought of it, right?

29
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,090
I mean Gauss thought
of it before we did,

30
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,140
but only because he
was born earlier.

31
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,070
It's a natural idea...

32
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,020
and died earlier, too.

33
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:07,020
Okay, and you've seen the idea.

34
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,870
But now, the part that I want
to show you is elimination

35
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,040
expressed in matrix language,
because the whole course --

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,740
all the key ideas get expressed
as matrix operations, not as

37
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,420
words.

38
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,080
And one of the operations,
of course, that we'll meet

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,500
is how do we multiply
matrices and why?

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,150
Okay, so there's a
system of equations.

41
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,270
Three equations
and three unknowns.

42
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,700
And there's the matrix, the
three by three matrix --

43
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,860
so this is the system Ax = b.

44
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,260
This is our system
to solve, Ax equal --

45
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,260
and the right-hand side
is that vector 2, 12, 2.

46
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,970
Okay.

47
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,640
Now, when I describe
elimination --

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,300
it gets to be a pain to
keep writing the equal signs

49
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,330
and the pluses and so on.

50
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,220
It's that matrix
that totally matters.

51
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,340
Everything is in that matrix.

52
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,820
But behind it is
those equations.

53
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,384
So what does elimination do?

54
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:18,925
What's the first
step of elimination?

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,110
We accept the first
equation, it's okay.

56
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,220
I'm going to multiply that
equation by the right number,

57
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,980
the right multiplier and
I'm going to subtract it

58
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,220
from the second equation.

59
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,400
With what purpose?

60
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,530
So that will decide what
the multiplier should be.

61
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:50,180
Our purpose is to knock out
the x part of equation two.

62
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,980
So our purpose is
to eliminate x.

63
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,820
So what do I multiply --

64
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,650
and again, I'll do
it with this matrix,

65
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,590
because I can do it short.

66
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,340
What's the multiplier here?

67
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,770
What do I multiply --
equation one and subtract.

68
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,810
Notice I'm saying
that word subtract.

69
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,870
I'd like to stick
to that convention.

70
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,890
I'll do a subtraction.

71
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,790
First of all this is the key
number that I'm starting with.

72
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,170
And that's called the pivot.

73
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,270
I'll put a box around it
and write its name down.

74
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,800
That's the first pivot.

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,641
The first pivot.

76
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:31,140
Okay.

77
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,130
So I'm going to use --

78
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,710
that's sort of like the key
number in that equation.

79
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,260
And now what's the multiplier?

80
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,720
So I'm going to --

81
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,950
my first row won't change,
that's the pivot row.

82
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,680
But I'm going to use it --

83
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,700
and now, finally, let me ask
you what the multiplier is.

84
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,680
Yes?

85
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,170
3 times that first equation
will knock out that 3.

86
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,110
Okay.

87
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,220
So what will it leave?

88
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,000
So the multiplier is 3.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,220
3 times that will make that 0.

90
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,720
That was our purpose.

91
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,490
3 2s away from the 8 will leave
a 2 and three 1s away from 1

92
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,960
will leave a minus 2.

93
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,400
And this guy didn't change.

94
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,530
Now the next step -- this is
forward elimination and that

95
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,802
Okay. step's completed.

96
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:26,260
Oh, well, you could say wait
a minute, what about the right

97
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,280
hand side?

98
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,610
Shall I carry -- the right-hand
side gets carried along.

99
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,410
Actually MatLab finishes up
with the left side before --

100
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,330
and then just goes back
to do the right side.

101
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,340
Maybe I'll be MatLab for
a moment and do that.

102
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,610
Okay.

103
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,470
I'm leaving a room for a column
of b, the right-hand side.

104
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,310
But I'll fill it in later.

105
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,360
Okay.

106
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,680
Now the next step of
elimination is what?

107
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,850
Well, strictly speaking...

108
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:05,250
this position that I cleaned
up was like the 2, 1 position,

109
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,470
row 2, column 1.

110
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,310
So I got a 0 in
the 2, 1 position.

111
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,990
I'll use 2,1 as the
index of that step.

112
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,050
The next step should
be to finish the column

113
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,770
and get a 0 in that position.

114
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,350
So the next step is really
the 3,1 step, row three,

115
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,330
column one.

116
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,390
But of course, I already have 0.

117
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,070
Okay.

118
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,930
So the multiplier is 0.

119
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:39,390
I take 0 of this equation away
from this one and I'm all set.

120
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,940
So I won't repeat that, but
there was a step there which,

121
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,750
MatLab would have to look --
it would look at this number

122
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,370
and, do that step, unless you
told it in advance that it was

123
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:53,870
0.

124
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,590
Okay.

125
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,530
Now what?

126
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,920
Now we can see the second
pivot, which is what?

127
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,700
The second pivot --
see, we've eliminated --

128
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,870
x is now gone from
this equation, right?

129
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,570
We're down to two
equations in y and z.

130
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,260
And so now I just do it again.

131
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,270
Like, everything's very cursive
at this -- this is like --

132
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,240
such a basic algorithm
and you've seen it,

133
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,670
but carry me through
one last step.

134
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,490
So this is still
the first pivot.

135
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,060
Now the second pivot is this
guy, who has appeared there.

136
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,620
And what's the multiplier, the
appropriate multiplier now?

137
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,130
And what's my purpose?

138
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:44,560
Is it to wipe out the
3, 2 position, right?

139
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,640
This was the 2, 1 step.

140
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,010
And now I'm going to
take the 3, 2 step.

141
00:07:53,010 --> 00:08:00,350
So this all stays the
same, 1 2 1, 0 2 -1

142
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,340
and the pivots are there.

143
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,510
Now I'm using this pivot,
so what's the multiplier?

144
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,630
this row, gets subtracted from
this row and makes that a 0.

145
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:20,770
So it's 0, 0 and is it a 5?

146
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,200
Yeah, I guess it's
a 5, is that right?

147
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,560
Because I have a
one there and I'm

148
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,330
subtracting twice of twice
this, so I think it's a 5 there.

149
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,370
There's the third pivot.

150
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,874
So let me put a box
around all three pivots.

151
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:48,900
Is there a -- oh, did I
just invent a negative one?

152
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,800
I'm sorry that the tape
can't, correct that

153
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,220
as easily as I can.

154
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,750
Okay.

155
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,683
Thank you very much.

156
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,610
You get an A in the course now.

157
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,570
Is that correct?

158
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,790
Is it correct now?

159
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,810
Okay.

160
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:15,830
So the three pivots are there --

161
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,840
I know right away a
lot about this matrix.

162
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,400
This elimination step from A --
this matrix I'm going to call

163
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,830
U. U for upper triangular.

164
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,690
So the whole purpose
of elimination

165
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,060
was to get from A to U.

166
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,830
And, literally, that's the
most common calculation

167
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,580
in scientific computing.

168
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,790
And people think of how
could I do that faster?

169
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,210
Because it's a
major, major thing.

170
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,560
But we're doing it the
straightforward way.

171
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,000
We found three pivots, and by
the way, I didn't say this,

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,410
pivots can't be 0.

173
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,160
I don't accept 0 as a pivot.

174
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,750
And I didn't get 0.

175
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,650
So this matrix is great.

176
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,150
It gave me three
pivots, I didn't

177
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,450
have to do anything special,
I just followed the rules and,

178
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,130
and the pivots are 1, 2 and 5.

179
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,880
By the way, just because I
always anticipate stuff from

180
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,120
a later day, if I wanted to know
the determinant of this matrix

181
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,010
-- which I never
do want to know,

182
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,990
but I would just
multiply the pivots.

183
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,540
The determinant is 10.

184
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:32,820
So even things like the
determinant are here.

185
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,960
Okay.

186
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,410
Now -- oh, let me talk
about failure for a moment,

187
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,510
and then --

188
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,370
and then come back to success.

189
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,700
How could this have failed?

190
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,525
How could -- by fail, I mean
to come up with three pivots.

191
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,800
I mean, there are
a couple of points.

192
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,530
I would have already
been in trouble

193
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,520
if this very first
number here was 0.

194
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,610
If it was a 0 there --
suppose that had been a 0,

195
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,760
there were no Xs in that
equation -- first equation.

196
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,040
Does that mean I can't
solve the problem?

197
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,180
Does that mean I quit?

198
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,700
No.

199
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,860
What do I do?

200
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,570
I switch rows.

201
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,010
I exchange rows.

202
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,210
So in case of a 0, I
will not say 0 pivot.

203
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,680
I will never be heard to
utter those words, 0 pivot.

204
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,270
But if there's a 0 in
the pivot position,

205
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,930
maybe I can say
that, I would try

206
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:45,400
to exchange for a lower equation
and get a proper pivot up

207
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,140
there.

208
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,640
Okay.

209
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,020
Now, for example, this
second pivot came out two.

210
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,510
Could it have come out 0?

211
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,110
What -- actually, if I
change that 8 a little bit,

212
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,650
I would have got
a little trouble.

213
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:08,210
What should I change that 8
to so that I run into trouble?

214
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,070
A 6.

215
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:14,840
If that had been a 6, then
this would have been 0

216
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,320
and I couldn't have
used that as the pivot.

217
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,230
But I could have
exchanged again.

218
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,960
In this case.

219
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,840
In this case, because when
can I get out of trouble?

220
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,490
I can get out of
trouble if there's

221
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,580
a non-0 below this
troublesome 0.

222
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,350
And there is here.

223
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,890
So I would be okay in this case.

224
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,080
If this was a 6, I
would survive by a row

225
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,290
exchange.

226
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:46,430
Now -- of course, it might have
happened that I couldn't do

227
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,280
the row, that -- that
there was 0s below it,

228
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,780
but here there wasn't.

229
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,370
Now, I could also have got in
trouble if this number 1 was

230
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,540
a little different.

231
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,260
See, that 1 became a
5, I guess, by the end.

232
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,940
So can you see what
number there would

233
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,130
have got me trouble that I
really couldn't get out of?

234
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,710
Trouble that I
couldn't get out of

235
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:22,810
would mean if 0 is
in the pivot position

236
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,270
and I've got no
place to exchange.

237
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:31,970
So there must be some number
which if I had had here

238
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,460
it would have meant failure.

239
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,590
Negative 4, good.

240
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,670
If it was a negative 4 here --
if it happened to be a negative

241
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,900
4, I'll temporarily
put it up here.

242
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,800
If this had been a
negative 4 z, then I

243
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,264
would have gone
through the same steps.

244
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:52,680
This would have been a minus
4, it still would have been a

245
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,750
minus 4.

246
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,610
But at the last minute
it would have become 0.

247
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,080
And there wouldn't have
been a third pivot.

248
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,790
The matrix would have
not been invertible.

249
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,860
Well, of course, the inverse of
a matrix is coming next week,

250
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,850
but, you've heard these words

251
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,590
before.

252
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,940
So, that's how we
identify failure.

253
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,680
There's temporary failure when
we can do a row exchange --

254
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,350
and get out of it, or there's
complete failure when we get

255
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,020
a 0 and --

256
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,280
and there's nothing
below that we can use.

257
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,400
Okay.

258
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,240
Let's stay with --

259
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,380
back to success now.

260
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:39,020
In fact, I guess the next
topic is back substitution.

261
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,430
So what's back substitution?

262
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:46,690
Well, now I'd better bring
the right-hand side in.

263
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:52,040
So what would MatLab do
and what should we do?

264
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,540
Let me bring in the right-hand
side as an extra column.

265
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,720
So there comes B.

266
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:05,650
So it's 2, 12, I would call
this the augmented matrix.

267
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,270
"Augment" means you've
tacked something on.

268
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,810
I've tacked on
this extra column.

269
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,870
Because, when I'm
working with equations,

270
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,990
I do the same thing
to both sides.

271
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,940
So, at this step, I subtracted 2
of the first equation away from

272
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,910
the second equation so
that this augmented --

273
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,960
I even brought some colored
chalk, but I don't know if it

274
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,550
shows up.

275
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,920
So this is like the augmented --

276
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,580
no!

277
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,060
Damn, circled the wrong thing.

278
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,020
Okay.

279
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,020
Here is b.

280
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,090
Okay, that's the extra column.

281
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,590
Okay.

282
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,380
So what happened to
that extra column,

283
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,170
the right-hand side
of the equations,

284
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,160
when I did the first step?

285
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,320
So that was 3 of this away
from this, so it took --

286
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,210
the 2 stayed the same, but
three 2s got taken away from 12,

287
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,900
leaving 6, and that
2 stayed the same.

288
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,050
So this is how it's
looking halfway along.

289
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,310
And let me just
carry to the end.

290
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,350
The 2 and the 6 stay
the same, but --

291
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,110
what do I have here?

292
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,790
Oh, gosh.

293
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,880
Help me out, now.

294
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,410
What -- so now I'm --

295
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,560
This is still like
forward elimination.

296
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,430
I got to this point,
which I think is right,

297
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,420
and now what did
I do at this step?

298
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,250
I multiplied that pivot by 2
or that whole equation by 2

299
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,430
and subtracted from
that, so I think

300
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,620
I take two 6s, which
is 12, away from the 2.

301
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:49,630
Do you think minus 10 is
my final right-hand side --

302
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,940
the right-hand side that
goes with U, and let me

303
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,820
call that once and
forever the vector c.

304
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:04,060
So c is what happens to b,
and U is what happens to A.

305
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,640
Okay.

306
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,050
There you've seen
elimination clean.

307
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,319
Okay.

308
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,300
Oh, what's back substitution?

309
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,810
So what are my final
equations, then?

310
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,200
Can I copy these equations?

311
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:34,650
x+2y+z=2 is still there and
2y-2z=6 is there, and 5z=-10.

312
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,250
Okay.

313
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,120
Those are the equations
that these numbers

314
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,000
are telling me about.

315
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,960
Those are the
equations U x equals c.

316
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,390
Okay, how do I solve them?

317
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,780
What one do I solve for first?

318
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,280
z.

319
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,550
I see immediately that the
correct value of z is negative

320
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,860
And what do I do next?

321
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,020
I go back upwards.

322
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,100
I now know z here.

323
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,360
So, if z is negative 2,
that's 4 there, is that right?

324
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,910
And so 2 y plus a 4
is 6, maybe y is 1.

325
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,070
Going -- this is
back substitution.

326
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,660
We're doing it on the
fly because it's so easy.

327
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,120
And then x is --

328
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,810
so x -- 2y is 2 minus
2, maybe x is 2?

329
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,580
So you see what back
substitution is.

330
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,160
It's the simple step solving
the equations in reverse order

331
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,350
because the system
is triangular.

332
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,340
Okay.

333
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,010
Good.

334
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,860
So that's elimination
and back substitution,

335
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,620
and I kept the
right-hand side along.

336
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,360
Okay, now what do I --

337
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,060
that, like, is
first piece of the

338
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,330
lecture.

339
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,780
What's the second piece?

340
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,530
Matrices are going to get in.

341
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:17,640
So I wrote stuff with x, y-s
and z-s in there, then I really,

342
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:24,060
got the right shorthand, just
writing the matrix entries,

343
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,980
and now I want to
write the operations

344
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,080
that I did in matrices, right?

345
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,190
I've carried the
matrices along, but I

346
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:42,860
haven't said the operation
those elimination steps,

347
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,251
I now want to
express as matrices.

348
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:45,750
Okay.

349
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,460
Here they come.

350
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,466
So now this is
elimination matrices.

351
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,500
Okay.

352
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,700
Let me take that first step,
which took me from 1 2 1 3 8 1

353
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,140
0 4 1.

354
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,310
I want to operate on that --

355
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:16,260
I want to do
elimination on that.

356
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,380
Okay.

357
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,170
Okay, now I'm
remembering a point

358
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:29,390
I want to single out as
especially important.

359
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,953
Let me move the
board up for that.

360
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,020
Because when we do matrix
operations, we've got to, like,

361
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,860
be able to see the big picture.

362
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,360
Okay.

363
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,290
Last time, I spoke about
the big picture of --

364
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:50,380
when I multiply a matrix
by a right-hand side.

365
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,690
If I have some matrix there
and I multiply it by 3 4 5,

366
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,920
let's say --

367
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,520
so here's a matrix --

368
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,120
what did I say -- well,
I guess I only said it

369
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,500
on the videotape, but -- do
you remember how I look at that

370
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,480
matrix multiplication?

371
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,410
The result of multiplying
a matrix by some vector

372
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:21,830
is a combination of the
columns of the matrix.

373
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,640
It's 3 times the first column.

374
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:33,630
It's 3 times column one plus 4
times column two plus 5 times

375
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,450
column three.

376
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,370
Okay.

377
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,970
I'm going to come back
to that multiple times.

378
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:51,430
What I wanted to do now was to
emphasize the parallel thing

379
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,390
with rows.

380
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,050
Why?

381
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:59,620
Because all our operations
here for this two weeks

382
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,150
of the course are
row operations.

383
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:10,270
So this isn't what I
need for row operations.

384
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,040
Let me do a row operation.

385
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:20,380
Suppose I have my matrix
again and suppose I multiply

386
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,520
on the left by some
-- let's say 1 2 7.

387
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,860
Again, I'm just, like,
saying what the result is.

388
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,240
And then we'll say how
matrix multiplication works

389
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,470
and we'll see that it's true.

390
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,260
Okay.

391
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,600
But maybe already I'm making --

392
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,960
I'm sort of bringing up -- the
central idea of linear algebra

393
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,490
is how these matrices work by
rows as well as by columns.

394
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:55,990
Okay.

395
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,730
How does it work by rows?

396
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:05,310
What -- so that's a row vector.

397
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,860
I could say that's a one
by three matrix, a row

398
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,335
vector multiplying a
three by three matrix.

399
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,300
What's the output?

400
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:23,440
What's the product of
a row times a matrix?

401
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,260
And -- okay, it's a row.

402
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,080
A row -- a column --

403
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,580
I'm sorry.

404
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,690
A matrix times a
column is a column.

405
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,350
So matrix times a -- yeah.

406
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:41,760
Matrix times a
column is a column.

407
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,080
And we know what column it is.

408
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,400
Over here, I'm doing
a row times a matrix.

409
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,500
And what's the answer?

410
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,260
It's one of that first
row, so it's 1 times --

411
00:23:53,260 --> 00:24:05,000
1 times row one, plus 2 times
row two plus 7 times row three.

412
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,810
When -- as we do
matrix multiplication,

413
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:13,650
keep your eye on what it's
doing with whole vectors.

414
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:18,140
And what it's doing -- what
it's doing in this case is

415
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,520
it's combining the rows.

416
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,750
And we have a combination, a
linear combination of the rows.

417
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,130
Okay, I want to use that.

418
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,190
Okay, so my question is what's
the matrix that does this first

419
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:44,180
step, that takes -- subtracts
3 of equation one from equation

420
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,680
two?

421
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,550
That's what I want to do.

422
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,800
So this is going to
be a matrix that's

423
00:24:48,800 --> 00:25:03,780
going to subtract 3 times
row one from row two,

424
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,160
and leaves the other rows the

425
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,670
same.

426
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,150
Just in -- I mean, the
answer is going to be that.

427
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,600
So whatever matrix this is --

428
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,450
and you're going to, like,
tell me what matrix will do it,

429
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:19,820
it's the matrix that leaves
the first row unchanged,

430
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,680
leaves the last row unchanged,
but takes 3 of these

431
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,740
away from this so it puts a 0
there, a 2 there and a minus 2.

432
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,470
Good.

433
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,420
What matrix will do it?

434
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,010
It's these.

435
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,880
It should be a
pretty simple matrix,

436
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,360
because we're doing
a very simple step.

437
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,840
We're just doing this
step that changes row two.

438
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,060
So actually, row
one is not changing.

439
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,490
So tell me how the
matrix should begin.

440
00:25:51,250 --> 00:26:01,130
One -- the first row of
the matrix will be 1 0 0,

441
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,050
because that's just the right
thing that takes one of that

442
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:08,030
row and none of the other
rows, and that's what we want.

443
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,160
What's the last
row of the matrix?

444
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:17,090
0 0 1, because that takes
one of the third row

445
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,030
and none of the other
rows, that's great.

446
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,370
Okay.

447
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,420
Now, suppose I didn't want
to do anything at all.

448
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,340
Suppose my row -- well, I guess
maybe I had a case here when I

449
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:33,080
already had a 0 and,
didn't have to do anything.

450
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:40,540
What matrix does nothing, like,
just leaves you where you were?

451
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,420
If I put in --

452
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:49,280
if I put in 0 1 0, that
would be -- that would be --

453
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,390
that's the matrix -- what's
the name of that matrix?

454
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,140
The identity matrix, right.

455
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,720
So it does absolutely nothing.

456
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,240
It just multiplies everything
and leaves it where it is.

457
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,120
It's like a one, like the
number one, for matrices.

458
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,360
But that's not what we want,
because we want to change this

459
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,100
row to --

460
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,060
so what's the correct --

461
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:16,610
what should I put in
here now to do it right?

462
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,280
I want to get -- what do I want?

463
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,660
What I -- I'm after --

464
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,360
I want 3 of row one
to get subtracted

465
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,210
off.

466
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:32,620
So what's the right matrix,
finish that matrix for me.

467
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,390
Negative 3 goes here?

468
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,560
And what goes here?

469
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,720
That 1.

470
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,610
And what goes here?

471
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,740
The 0.

472
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,230
That's the good matrix.

473
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,700
That's the matrix
that takes minus 3

474
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,800
of row one plus the row two
and gives the new row 2.

475
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:57,350
Should we just, like,
check some particular

476
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,130
entry?

477
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,380
How do I check a
particular entry

478
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,640
of a matrix in matrix
multiplication?

479
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,050
Like, suppose I wanted to check
the entry here that's in row

480
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,850
two, column three.

481
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,400
So where does the entry in row
two, column three come from?

482
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,660
I would look at
row two of this guy

483
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:26,230
and column three of this
one to get that number.

484
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,950
That number comes from the
second row and the third column

485
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:34,120
and I just take this
dot product minus 3 --

486
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,360
I'm multiplying -- minus 3
plus 1 and 0 gives the minus 2.

487
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,010
Yeah.

488
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,640
It works.

489
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,840
So we got various ways
to multiply matrices now.

490
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,870
We're sort of,
like -- informally.

491
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,600
We've got by columns,
we've got -- well,

492
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,670
we will have by columns,
by rows, by each entry at a

493
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,370
time.

494
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:01,360
But it's good to see that
matrix multiplication when one

495
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,030
of the matrices is so simple.

496
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:08,180
So this guy is our
elementary matrix.

497
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:12,530
Let's call it E for
elementary or elimination.

498
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:18,130
And let me put the indexes 2 1,
because it's the matrix that we

499
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,380
needed to fix the 2 1 position.

500
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,790
It's the matrix that we
needed to get this 2 1

501
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:29,340
position to be Okay.

502
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,000
Good enough.

503
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,140
So what do I do next?

504
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,550
I need another matrix, right?

505
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,610
I need to --

506
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,420
there's another step here.

507
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,330
And I want to express
the whole elimination

508
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,780
process in matrix language.

509
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:54,510
So tell me what -- so next
step, step two, which was what?

510
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:59,970
Subtract -- what was -- what
was the actual step that we did?

511
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,670
I think I subtracted
-- do you remember?

512
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,730
I had a 2 in the pivot
and a 4 below it,

513
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,700
so I subtracted two times --

514
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,690
times row two from row three.

515
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,870
From row three.

516
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,040
Tell me the matrix
that will do that.

517
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,600
And tell me its name.

518
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,390
Okay, it's going to be E,
for elementary or elimination

519
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:36,080
matrix and what's the index
number that I used to tell me

520
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,590
what E --

521
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,750
3, 2, right?

522
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,690
Because it's fixing
this 3 2 position.

523
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,550
And what's the matrix, now?

524
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:52,200
Okay, you remember -- so E 3 2
is supposed to multiply my guy

525
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,840
that I have and it's supposed
to produce the right result,

526
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,320
which was -- it leaves -- it's
supposed to leave the first

527
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,420
row, it's supposed to leave the
second row and it's supposed

528
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:10,490
to straighten out that
third row to this.

529
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,775
And what's the matrix
that does that?

530
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,820
1 0 0, right?

531
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,350
Because we don't change the
first row and the next row

532
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,190
we don't change either,
and the last row

533
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,240
is the one we do change.

534
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,730
And what do I do?

535
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,540
Let's see, I
subtract two times --

536
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,120
so what's this row?

537
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,100
What's this here?

538
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,530
0, right, because the
first row's not involved.

539
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,520
It's just in the 3 2
position, isn't it?

540
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,980
This the key number is this
minus the multiplier that goes

541
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,430
-- sitting there in
that 3 2 position.

542
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:59,233
Is it a minus 2 to subtract 2
and then this is a 1 so that --

543
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,660
the overall effect is to take
minus 2 of this row plus 1 of

544
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,200
that.

545
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,700
Okay.

546
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:15,280
So, I've now given you the
pieces, the elimination

547
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,720
matrices, the elementary
matrices that take each step.

548
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,890
So now what?

549
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,510
Now the next point
in the lecture

550
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:32,450
is to put those steps together
into a matrix that does it all

551
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,930
and see how it all happens.

552
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,220
So now I'm going to
express the whole --

553
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:46,530
everything we did today so
far on A was to start with A,

554
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:53,150
we multiplied it by E 2 1,
that was the first step --

555
00:32:53,150 --> 00:33:01,080
and then we multiplied that
result by E 3 2 and that led us

556
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,970
to this thing and
what was that matrix?

557
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:10,890
U.

558
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,840
You see why I like
matrix notation,

559
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,750
because there in,
like, little space --

560
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:23,460
a few bits when its compressed
on the web -- is everything --

561
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,490
is this whole lecture.

562
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,550
Okay.

563
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:33,720
Now there -- there are
important facts about matrix

564
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,940
multiplication.

565
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:40,440
And we're close to maybe
the most important.

566
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,320
And that is this.

567
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,470
Suppose I ask you this question.

568
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:49,140
Suppose I start with
a matrix A and I

569
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,410
want to end with
a matrix U and I

570
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,230
want to say what matrix
does the whole job?

571
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:05,240
What matrix takes me from A to
U, using the letters I've got?

572
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,969
And the answer is simple.

573
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:13,275
I'm not asking this as --
but it's highly important.

574
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,429
How would I create
the matrix that

575
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,639
does the whole job
at once, that does

576
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,840
all of elimination in one shot?

577
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,810
It would be --

578
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,489
I would just put
these together, right?

579
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:34,310
In other words, this is the
thing I'm struggling to say.

580
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,810
I can move those parentheses.

581
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,050
If I keep the
matrices in order --

582
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:45,030
I can't mess around with
the order of the matrices,

583
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,460
but I can change the order
that I do the multiplications.

584
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,004
I can multiply
these two first --

585
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:59,490
in other words, you see what
those parentheses are doing?

586
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:04,910
It's saying -- multiply the
Es first and that gives you

587
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,660
the matrix that does
everything at once.

588
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,370
Okay.

589
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:13,920
So this fact, that this is
automatically the same as this

590
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,870
--

591
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:20,590
for every matrix multiplication,
which I'm conscious of still

592
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,600
not telling you in
every detail, but, like,

593
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,910
you're seeing how it works --
and this is highly important --

594
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:32,150
and maybe tell me the long
word that describes this law

595
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:37,620
for matrices, that you
can move the parentheses?

596
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,670
It's called the associative law.

597
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,551
I think you can now forget that.

598
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,320
But don't forget the law.

599
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,450
I mean, like, forget
the word associative.

600
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,240
I don't know.

601
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,950
But don't forget the law.

602
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:59,540
Because actually, we'll see so
many steps in linear algebra,

603
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,220
so many proofs,
even, of main fact

604
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,495
come from just moving
the parentheses.

605
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:15,400
And it's not that easy to
prove that this is correct,

606
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,240
you have to go into the
gory details of matrix

607
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,700
multiplication, do
it both ways and see

608
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,360
that you come out the same.

609
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,360
Maybe I'll leave the
author to do that.

610
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,160
Okay.

611
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,650
So there we go.

612
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:40,160
So there's a single matrix,
I could call it E --

613
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,780
while we're talking about these
matrices, tell me one other --

614
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,140
there's another type
of elementary matrix,

615
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,510
and we already said
why we might need it.

616
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,520
We didn't need it in this case.

617
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,580
But it's the matrix
that exchanges two rows.

618
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,990
It's called a
permutation matrix.

619
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:06,500
Can you just, like, tell me what
that would So I'm just -- like,

620
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,260
this is a slight digression
and be? we'll -- yes,

621
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,600
so let me get some -- let me
figure out where I'm going

622
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,970
to put a permutation matrix.

623
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,120
You'll see I'm always
squeezing stuff in.

624
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,840
So permutation.

625
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:33,530
Or, in fact this one you'll,
like, exchange rows --

626
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:37,920
shall I exchange rows one and
two, just to make life easy?

627
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,450
So if I had my matrix -- no, let
-- let me just do two by two.

628
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,330
|a b; c d|.

629
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:49,610
Suppose I want to find
the matrix that exchanges

630
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,330
those rows.

631
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,350
What is it?

632
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,260
So the matrix that
exchanges those rows --

633
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,640
the row I want is
c d and it's there.

634
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,100
So I better take one of it.

635
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,010
And the row I want here is up
top, so I'll take one of that.

636
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,180
So actually, I'm just --

637
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,850
the easy way -- this is my
matrix that I'll call P,

638
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:17,750
for permutation.

639
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,650
It's the matrix -- actually, the
easy way to find it is just do

640
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:30,500
the thing to the
identity matrix.

641
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,650
Exchange the rows of
the identity matrix

642
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:38,830
and then that's the matrix that
will do row exchanges for you.

643
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:43,000
Suppose I wanted to
exchange columns instead.

644
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,290
Columns have hardly got
into today's lecture,

645
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,430
but they certainly are
going to be around.

646
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:53,010
How could I -- if I started
with this matrix |a b; c d|

647
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,740
then I wouldn't --

648
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,480
I'm not even going
to write this down,

649
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,460
I'm just going to ask you,
because in elimination, we're

650
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,240
doing rows.

651
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,090
But suppose we
wanted to exchange

652
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,225
the columns of a matrix.

653
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,450
How would I do that?

654
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:19,110
What matrix multiplication
would do that job?

655
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,980
Actually, why not?

656
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,020
I'll write it down.

657
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,840
So this is --

658
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,220
I'll write it under here
and then hide it again.

659
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:28,740
Okay.

660
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,580
Suppose I had my
matrix |a b; c d|

661
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:38,160
and I want to get to a c
over here and b d here.

662
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,620
What matrix does that job?

663
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:58,520
Can I multiply -- can I cook up
some matrix that produces that

664
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,800
answer?

665
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,200
You can see from where I
put my hand I was really

666
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,660
asking can I put a matrix
here on the left that

667
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,850
will exchange columns?

668
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:16,260
And the answer is no.

669
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm just bringing
out again this point

670
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,940
that when I multiply on the
left, I'm doing row operations.

671
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,790
So if I want to do
a column operation,

672
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:29,260
where do I put that
permutation matrix?

673
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,970
On the right.

674
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,220
If I put it here, where I just
barely left room for it --

675
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:40,230
so I'll exchange the two
columns of the identity.

676
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,410
Then it comes out
right, because now I'm

677
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,980
multiplying a column at a time.

678
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,230
This is the first column
and says take one --

679
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,500
take none of that column,
one of this one and then you

680
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
got it.

681
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,240
Over here, take one
of this one, none

682
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,420
of this one and you've got a c.

683
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,990
So, in short, to do
column operations,

684
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,310
the matrix multiplies
on the right.

685
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,660
To do row operations, it
multiplies on the left.

686
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,990
Okay, okay, and it's row
operations that we're really

687
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,535
doing.

688
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:13,035
Okay.

689
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:23,230
And of course, I
mentioned in passing,

690
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:30,840
but I better say it very
clearly that you can't exchange

691
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,120
the orders of matrices.

692
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,340
And that's just the point
I was making again here.

693
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,520
A times B is not the
same as B times A.

694
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:46,030
You have to keep these matrices
in their Gauss given order

695
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:49,750
here, right?

696
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,930
But you can move
the parentheses,

697
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:57,310
so that, in other words,
the commutative law, which

698
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:03,850
would allow you to take it
in the other order is false.

699
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,930
So we have to keep
it in that order.

700
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:06,690
Okay.

701
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,915
So what next?

702
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,670
I could do this multiplication.

703
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,110
I could do E 32.

704
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,525
So let me come back
to see what that was.

705
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,470
Here was E 2 1.

706
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:33,020
And here is E 3 2.

707
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:39,320
And if I multiply those
two matrices together --

708
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,064
E 3 2 and then E 2 1,
I'll get a single matrix

709
00:42:43,064 --> 00:42:43,980
that does elimination.

710
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,110
I don't want to do it that --

711
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,350
if I do that multiplication --

712
00:42:55,350 --> 00:43:00,790
there -- there's a
better way to do this.

713
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:03,520
And so in this last few
minutes of today's lecture,

714
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,540
can I anticipate
that better way?

715
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:15,260
The better way is to think
not how do I get from A to U,

716
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:20,310
but how do I get
from U back to A?

717
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:24,730
So reversing steps
is going to come in.

718
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:28,950
Inverse -- I'll use
the word inverse here.

719
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:29,630
Okay.

720
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:37,250
So let me make the first step
at what's the inverse matrix?

721
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,560
All the matrices you've seen
on this board have inverses.

722
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,910
I didn't write any
bad matrices down.

723
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:50,770
We spoke about possible
failure, and for a moment,

724
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,400
we put in a matrix
that would fail.

725
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,260
But right now, all
these matrices are good,

726
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,720
they're all invertible.

727
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,010
And let's take the
inverse -- well,

728
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:04,800
let me say first what does
the inverse mean and find it?

729
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,300
Okay.

730
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:10,850
So we're getting a little
leg up on inverses.

731
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:16,172
Okay, so this is the
final moments of today.

732
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,870
Sorry, he's still there.

733
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:23,382
Okay.

734
00:44:23,382 --> 00:44:23,882
Inverses.

735
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,320
Okay, and I'm just going
to take one example

736
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,870
and then we're done.

737
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:39,480
The example I'll take will
be that E. So my matrix

738
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,640
is 1 0 0 minus 3 1 0 0 0 1.

739
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:55,870
And I want to find the
matrix that undoes that step.

740
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,720
So what was that step?

741
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,600
The step was subtract 3
times row one from row two.

742
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:10,670
So what matrix will get me back?

743
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:14,540
What matrix will bring back --

744
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:19,530
you know, if I started with a 2
12 2 and I changed it to a 2 6

745
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:25,580
2 because of this guy, I want
to get back to the 2 12 I want

746
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:30,150
to find the matrix which --
which undoes elimination,

747
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:33,240
the matrix which multiplies
this to give the identity.

748
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:42,940
And you can tell me what I
should do in words first,

749
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,570
and then we'll write down
the matrix that does it.

750
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:50,130
If this step subtracted
3 times row 1 from row 2,

751
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:51,500
what's the inverse step?

752
00:45:51,500 --> 00:46:02,120
I add 3 times row one
to row two, right?

753
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,080
I add it back.

754
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,610
The -- what I subtracted
away, I add back.

755
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:08,770
So the inverse matrix
in this case is --

756
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,660
I now want to add 3
times row one to row two,

757
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:17,020
so I won't change row one,
I won't change row three

758
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:23,000
and I'll add 3 times
row one to row two.

759
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,740
That's a case where
the inverse is clear.

760
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:33,530
It's clear in words what to
do, because what this did

761
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:37,330
was simple to express.

762
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:43,290
It just changed row two by
subtracting 3 of row one.

763
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,670
So to invert it, I go that way.

764
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,940
And if you -- if we
do that calculation,

765
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,240
3 times this row plus
1 times this row,

766
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,980
comes out the right
row of the identity.

767
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,050
Okay, so inverses are an --

768
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:05,020
so if this matrix was E and this
matrix is I for identity, then

769
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:08,370
what's the notation
for this guy?

770
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:11,010
E to the minus one.

771
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,710
E inverse.

772
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:13,950
Okay.

773
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:16,040
Let's stop there for today.

774
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,660
That's a little jump on
what's coming on Monday.

775
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,050
So, see you Monday.
