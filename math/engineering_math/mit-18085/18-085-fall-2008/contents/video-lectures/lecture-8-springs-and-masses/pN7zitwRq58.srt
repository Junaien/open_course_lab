9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:28,020
PROFESSOR STRANG: So today we
move to a topic I really like.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:34,260
It's the beginning
of the applications.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,210
So the particular
application that comes first

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,990
will be springs and masses,
a pretty classical problem.

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:47,250
But what we're looking
for is how do we model it,

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,520
what's the main
framework to look

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,850
at a whole series of problems.

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,980
So this is number
one in the series

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,240
and it's the most
straightforward.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,940
Let me draw it with four
springs connecting three masses.

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,080
And let me fix both ends.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,810
So this will be a
fixed-fixed picture.

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,890
So the masses have some weight.

22
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,980
The weight pulls
the springs down.

23
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:28,270
When there was no weight
acting they were not stretched.

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,530
The masses will
stretch the springs.

25
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,950
And the question is
how much do those,

26
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,060
we're looking for
the displacements.

27
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,090
How much does mass one go down?

28
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:40,590
Mass two?

29
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,270
Mass three?

30
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,740
And of course, essentially
the displacement

31
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:52,080
here is zero and here is zero.

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,820
I don't know if you can
imagine these masses have acted

33
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:04,960
so that the position before
gravity was turned on

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,240
was somewhere up here
and then it came here.

35
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,170
So this moved down
by a distance u_1.

36
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,530
Let's use u for
the displacements.

37
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,100
So if I look at
this main picture

38
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:25,260
here I have displacements,
movements, u_1, u_2, u_3.

39
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,470


40
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,120
Now what happens physically?

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,710
Important in every
one of these examples

42
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,235
to see what's
happening physically.

43
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:41,400
Of course, this one
moved down by some u_2,

44
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,340
this one moved down from its
total rest position to u_3.

45
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,490
These are not oscillating.

46
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,690
Next week they'll start
moving, time will enter.

47
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,710
Here I'm just looking
for a steady state.

48
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,950
They come to rest, they stretch.

49
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,740
So what's your feeling of what's
going to happen here, somehow?

50
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:14,580
The displacements look to me
like they'll all be positive.

51
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,100
What's the key
equation going to be?

52
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,650
That when this moves down
it will stretch that spring.

53
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:29,090
Hooke's Law will say there's a
force, the spring pulls back.

54
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,330
The spring pulls
back with a force

55
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,440
proportional to the stretch.

56
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,540
So u_1, u_2, and
u_3 are movements.

57
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,860
Here is a key question.

58
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,840
What's the stretching
in spring number two?

59
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,790
So this is spring one,
two, three and four.

60
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,900
How much does spring number
two stretch? u_2-u_1.

61
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,020
A difference is coming in there.

62
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,230
So let me put that up here.

63
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:04,620
So stretching or elongation,
I'll use two words,

64
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,840
elongation I'll say
sometimes because that

65
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,950
starts with a letter e.

66
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,990
So these are the
elongations in the springs,

67
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:22,120
in the four springs.

68
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,230
It's the amount the
spring stretches.

69
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:29,830
Or what's the opposite
of stretching?

70
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,750
Compression somehow.

71
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,230
Looks to me like this
last spring, at least,

72
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,170
is going to be compressed, and
I'm not sure about the others.

73
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,250
So we've got four springs.

74
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:52,500
And each one has a stretching
or compression, an elongation.

75
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,730
And then there's a link then
that you already told me.

76
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:01,120
That e_2 is, just
from the picture,

77
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,000
e_2 is the difference
between u_2 and u_1.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,250
Because the lower mass
goes down by distance u_2,

79
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,040
the upper mass by u_1 and spring
is stretched by the difference

80
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,560
u_2-u_1.

81
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,570
So that's a first key fact.

82
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:26,310
So that expresses somehow
a fact of geometry.

83
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,840
Of sort of the way
things are connected.

84
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,230
The material properties
of the springs

85
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,340
have not got into
the picture yet.

86
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,500
But now Hooke's Law brings
them into the picture.

87
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,250
By stretching a
spring that produces

88
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,980
a force that pulls back.

89
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:54,880
So we get, can I say,
forces in the spring.

90
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:04,030
And let me give those a
name w. w_1, 2, 3, and 4.

91
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:11,590
And then the link between
the stretching and the force

92
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:18,040
that it produces is--
So that's somehow

93
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,950
where the properties of
the material come in.

94
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,370
So I have to say, what are
the properties of the springs?

95
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,430
So this will be
Hooke's Law, this step.

96
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:38,190
Hooke's Law for this
particular application.

97
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:46,870
And so I have to say these
springs have spring constants.

98
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,020
So I haven't completed the
description of the problem

99
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,490
until I've told
you about springs

100
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,900
themselves and the masses.

101
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,200
So the spring constants will
be c_1, c_2, c_3, and c_4.

102
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,320
And now what does
Hooke's Law say?

103
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,410
Usually this physical law in
the middle we keep it linear.

104
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:19,580
Of course, we all understand
that if these springs were

105
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,080
enormously stretched
the elastic property

106
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,510
could become non-linear.

107
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,150
It could become plastic.

108
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,820
The first law always
has somebody's name.

109
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,280
Was the person to see
that in some range

110
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,530
of small displacements, so
I guess that's the answer.

111
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,230
We're speaking here about
small displacements,

112
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,910
small stretching up
to the point where

113
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,770
Hooke's Law continues to hold.

114
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,560
And now what does
Hooke's Law say?

115
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:00,100
It says that each
force in the spring

116
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:07,370
is proportional to the
stretching of the spring.

117
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,570
You could say it's-- a diagonal
matrix is showing up here.

118
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:19,380
The vector of w's, the vector
of forces in the spring is

119
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,560
a diagonal matrix C, which
just has these numbers

120
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:32,080
on the diagonal,
...c_4, times the e's.

121
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,430
So of course I'm going to write
that in matrix notation as W

122
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:45,100
equals a matrix C times e.

123
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,670
So there in the
middle is the physics.

124
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,140
The material properties,
the constitutive law.

125
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:59,950
C can stand for constants,
for constitutive law,

126
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:05,130
later for conductances.

127
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,680
It's the place where
the material enters.

128
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,860
And now how do we
complete this picture?

129
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:21,730
In the end we have to
bring in the masses.

130
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:27,910
Gravity is the external force
that's making things happen.

131
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:33,030
We need a force
term from outside

132
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,110
to move us away from zeroes.

133
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:43,860
And that will be the
downward forces f_1, f_2,

134
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,210
f_3 on the three masses.

135
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,790
So I plan to complete this
picture with a force balance

136
00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:12,070
equation on the
masses, on each mass.

137
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,360
When I use the word
framework there,

138
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,320
this is what I
was talking about.

139
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,840
I guess what I want
to say is I really

140
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:29,820
have found that this way
of describing, modeling

141
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,930
the problem is successful
for so many applications.

142
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:43,310
You have somehow a geometry, a
step which'll involve a matrix

143
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:50,790
A. Then you have a physical
step which involves a matrix C.

144
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,940
And then finally you
have a force balance.

145
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:02,910
In a way this force
balance or its analog,

146
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,650
the analog would be
Kirchhoff's current law.

147
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,990
We'll see that for networks.

148
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,140
Flow in equals flow out.

149
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,120
Force on one side equals
force on the other.

150
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,800
If we're talking
about equilibrium

151
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,130
we can expect our model to
have an equation like that.

152
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:25,560
And for me it really helps to
know when a new model comes in.

153
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,310
Like somebody'll
come into my office

154
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:33,310
with a problem in
chemistry or biology.

155
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:39,920
But if it fits in
this framework I'll

156
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,380
be looking for a balance
equation, a continuity

157
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:52,130
equation at the end.

158
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,170
This part was easy and
it's these two parts

159
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,520
that I want to pin down.

160
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,430
Well you told me
how to start here.

161
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:07,340
So the elongation, so I want
to take this step again.

162
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:14,310
I want to find the elongations
from some matrix that

163
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:20,240
multiplies the displacements.

164
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,000
So I'm just
completing this step.

165
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,010
And you told me what is the
stretching in spring two.

166
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,250
Again, do you mind
just saying it again?

167
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,630
The stretching in that
second spring, the amount,

168
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:45,120
it's made longer by the action
of gravity was? u_2-u_1.

169
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,850
u_2-u_1.

170
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:55,210
So e_2 will be, a minus one here
for u_1, a plus one and a zero.

171
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:04,090
That will be a typical row of
this matrix, the displacement

172
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,270
stretching matrix,
you could say.

173
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,860
Now what about the
stretching in e_1?

174
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,190
What's the stretching in e_1?

175
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:15,210


176
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,200
Only u_1.

177
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,870
Because essentially
it's u_1-u_0 but u_0

178
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,220
is set to zero by the support.

179
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,970
So we only have u_1.

180
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,130
Because that multiplication
just gives us-- So e_1 is u_1.

181
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,210
e_2 is u_2-u_1.

182
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,790
e_3 is what?

183
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:43,790
The stretching in
the third spring.

184
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,790
What is it? u_3-u_2.

185
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,890
So I need a one for u_3
and a minus one for u_2.

186
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,690
And the stretching
in the fourth spring?

187
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,660
What's the stretching
in the fourth spring?

188
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,980
I've sort of, and you have
too, mentally given a plus sign

189
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,690
when the spring is
extended and a minus

190
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,810
sign when it's compressed.

191
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,280
Plus for tension,
minus for compression.

192
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,900
So since I fixed that
one, u_4 was zero, so what

193
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,600
do I have in this last row?

194
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,900
Just minus u_3.

195
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,450


196
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,640
I guess what I'm saying
here is that if we

197
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,290
get a systematic
approach to problems

198
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:46,130
then we know we're looking for
a matrix that connects these.

199
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:50,140
We're looking for the material
constitutive law that does this

200
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,710
and now we're
looking for this one.

201
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,570
We kind of know where we are.

202
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,450
What to look for.

203
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,190
And so this matrix is the
matrix I'm going to call A.

204
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,010
So this is e=Au.

205
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:10,000


206
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,980
Well one more step to go.

207
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,400
And that will be the
force balance step.

208
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:22,010
So now, what's the
equation for balance?

209
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,790
The external forces
are the masses.

210
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,900
Well, I guess to
get the units right,

211
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:34,160
it should be mass times g,
the gravitational constant.

212
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:43,220
So let me put external
forces f_1, f_2, and f_3.

213
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:51,390
The three masses will be
m_1*g, m_2*g, and m_3*g.

214
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,350
So those are the
forces from outside.

215
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,800
Now it's the balance
equation I'm after.

216
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,570
So this is in this position.

217
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,910
It's in equilibrium.

218
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,970
And what does that tell us?

219
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,020
That tells us that the
total force on this mass,

220
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,300
so I'm going to
take each mass, it's

221
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,440
like a free body
force diagram here.

222
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,770
I'm looking now at that mass.

223
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,870
I'm saying what forces
are acting on it

224
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,380
and I'm making them balance.

225
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,800
So what equation
will that give me?

226
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,010
So let me write that.

227
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:30,290
This is now the force
balance equation.

228
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:37,830
Force balance at each mass.

229
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,280
How much force is pulling up?

230
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,320
What's the force pulling up on?

231
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,580
So this spring is
pulling upwards.

232
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,750
And it's pulling
upwards by w_1, right?

233
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,160
Just getting these
letters right.

234
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,090
The w's were the
internal resisting force,

235
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,930
reacting force in the
spring. w_1 is pulling up.

236
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,570
What other forces are
acting? w_2 is pulling down.

237
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:14,550
And also pulling down is?

238
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,760
Gravity, m_1*g.

239
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,480
So the balance of forces there
says that w_1, the force up,

240
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,980
is w_2, the force
down, and m_1*g.

241
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,990
And similarly the
next one will have,

242
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,740
the next mass if I look just
at that I see a force up,

243
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,080
a force down and gravity down.

244
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:45,990
So w_2 will be, well, that's
the pull up, will be w_3+m_2*g.

245
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,410
And the third one, the
force up on the third one

246
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,600
will be the force
down on the third one.

247
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,920
so I think those are
the equations of force

248
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,980
balance written one at a time.

249
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:08,080
And now, of course I'm
going to write that--

250
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,990
So that's three
equations with four w's.

251
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,010
So I want to write that
as, I want to bring the w's

252
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,640
all to the left-hand side.

253
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,310
Can I do that?

254
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,910
Can I just bring those
over with minus signs?

255
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,710
And make these equal signs.

256
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:41,620
So now we've got internal
force balancing external force.

257
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,670
This vector of external
forces is the f's and this

258
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,620
is the internal forces.

259
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,350
Now somewhere there we're
going to see a matrix.

260
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,670
So I'm going to write this
equation as some matrix.

261
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,750
Well, let's figure out
what that matrix is.

262
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,180
So its shape is what?

263
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,470
I've got three equations, so I
need three rows in the matrix.

264
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,060
I've got four w's so
I need four columns.

265
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,790
So it's going to multiply
w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4

266
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:21,940
to give these three masses,
can I call them f_1, f_2, f_3,

267
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,890
just to have a good letter.

268
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,350
We're almost there.

269
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,900
What's the matrix?

270
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:37,290
What's the matrix for this
final step, the force balance

271
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,540
equation?

272
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,700
I just read it off.

273
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,810
w_1-w_2.

274
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:47,280
I think I've got that.

275
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,940
w_2-w_3.

276
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,030
Tell me what the second
row of the matrix

277
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,390
looks like to give me w_2-w_3.

278
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:01,250
zero, one for the
w_2, minus one.

279
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,280
Good.

280
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:13,260
And for the third, the
final row? [0, 0, 1, -1].

281
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,240
So that completes
the third piece.

282
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,900
If I'd given you the problem
as I did, drawn the problem,

283
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,270
described it, you
know that there's

284
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,450
going to be a connection
between the external forces

285
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,270
and the displacements.

286
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,700
But what I'm trying
to say is a good way

287
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,650
to see the connection is to
see it in three simple steps.

288
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,770
The simple step that gets
you from the displacements

289
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,730
to the springs.

290
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,140
A second step
within the springs.

291
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,310
A third step back
to the nodes, you

292
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,990
could say, back to the masses.

293
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:59,430
And of course, the key question
is, what's that matrix?

294
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,940
And do you recognize it?

295
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,770
Do we need a new
name for that matrix?

296
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,230
The matrix in the third step?

297
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:13,470
So this third step is going
to be that some matrix times

298
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:19,070
w is f and what's that matrix?

299
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,290
What's the good name
for us to give it?

300
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,170
A transpose is the
best possible name.

301
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,010
If we've given this
matrix the name

302
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,500
A, the stretching
displacement matrix,

303
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,650
the strain in elasticity,
this becomes the strains,

304
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,930
these become the stresses.

305
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,720
But the beauty is,
just beautiful,

306
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,070
that the matrix in this law
is the transpose of this one.

307
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,830
So it's A transpose.

308
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:59,510
So that's the framework seen
now here for the first time.

309
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,640
So the key point was that
A and A transpose both

310
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,060
appeared but with physical
material properties,

311
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,190
constitutive matrix in between.

312
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:15,720
So if we put the pieces
together, then we're golden.

313
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,380
And then, let's do an example
to see what actually happened.

314
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:31,240
So the equations were
e=Aw-- e=Au, then w=Ce,

315
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,010
that's Hooke's Law,
and then A transpose--

316
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:40,020
or maybe I'll write
it as f=A transpose*w.

317
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,900


318
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,530
That's the three steps.

319
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:50,770
So in this problem the source
term showed up at that point.

320
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,700
The source term came
from external forces.

321
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,780
I've got three equations.

322
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,570
Now I'm going to put
them together into one.

323
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,560
I'll put them into one equation.

324
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,510
So this w I'll just substitute.

325
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:11,740
So it's A transpose
w is Ce, and e is Au.

326
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,170
So I have A transpose C Au.

327
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:20,790
So that's the ultimate.

328
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,810
That's put the whole
structure together.

329
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,850
That's the equation
you have to solve.

330
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:35,780
This would be called
the stiffness matrix.

331
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:42,930
And I use the letter
K for that one.

332
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,800
So our equation is Ku=f.

333
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:56,590
This is our final equation.

334
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:03,140
Well, we didn't know w.

335
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,520
There are two unknowns here.

336
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,460
Two physical things
that you want to find.

337
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,460
If you're designing a
bridge or a structure

338
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,640
you want to know
the displacements

339
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:21,720
and then you want to know
the internal forces w.

340
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,690
It's really beautiful.

341
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:28,860
The two unknowns of u
and w are somehow dual,

342
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:36,350
we can work with one, work
with the other, work with both.

343
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,390
Oh let me just mention that
the finite element method will

344
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:46,590
fit this framework and somehow
this name stiffness matrix has

345
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,970
become famous for finite
elements in structures

346
00:24:50,970 --> 00:25:01,630
and then it's just exploded
to appear all over the place.

347
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,273
I guess we should
look at A transpose

348
00:25:03,273 --> 00:25:09,710
C A. We can see
what it looks like.

349
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,010
And also just from the
way it looks there.

350
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,440
So I can write it
out explicitly.

351
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,040
I think we want to.

352
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,990
But at the same time
I can learn something

353
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,190
from just seeing how
it's put together.

354
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,190
What can you tell me
about A transpose C A?

355
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,380
Let's get the shape first.

356
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,400
Just to see the shape
of these things.

357
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,510
The matrix A is what?

358
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,400
What's the shape of A?

359
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,960
It's over here.

360
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,180
Four by three.

361
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,880
Four by three.

362
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:52,400
And the shape of C was,
three by three is it?

363
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,870
Where have I got, that C matrix
better be here somewhere.

364
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,090
Oh, no, it's four by four.

365
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,110
Four springs.

366
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,440
Of course, it had to be four by
four to do that multiplication.

367
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,310
There's the C matrix.

368
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,320
Four by four, thanks.

369
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,280
And the A transpose matrix?

370
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,200
Three by four, thanks.

371
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,470
So the net result
is three by three.

372
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:15,970
Good.

373
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:20,220
So it's a square matrix.

374
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,260
K is a square matrix.

375
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,550
What else can you
tell me about it?

376
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,480
Now we're going to begin to use
some of the, sort of the matrix

377
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,120
preparation.

378
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,430
These matrices are
kind of friends by now.

379
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:42,081
This is a difference
matrix, somehow.

380
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:42,580
Right?

381
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:47,430
The stretchings are
differences and displacements.

382
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,230
That's its transpose.

383
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,130
And then the C matrix,
which is the new thing, sort

384
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:59,570
of the new guy to appear
today, is diagonal.

385
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,340
Well if I asked you now,
without writing out the matrix,

386
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,030
for one more
property, it's square,

387
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,300
what else could you
tell me about it?

388
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,810
Symmetric is going to be a very
good guess and let's see why.

389
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,150
Why is it symmetric?

390
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,470
How do we show that that?

391
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,020
What do I do?

392
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:25,300
I take the transpose.

393
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:32,530
If I take my K transpose, now
I write it as, what do I do?

394
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,890
It's a product of things.

395
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:39,210
So when I transpose a product I
have the individual transposes

396
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,430
in the opposite order.

397
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,900
So A, its transpose comes first.

398
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,760
C, its transpose comes next.

399
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,730
A transpose, its
transpose comes last.

400
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:57,270
So that's just the rules
of matrix transposes.

401
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,430
Now what?

402
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,670
Now I'm ready to use the
wonderful fact of what

403
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,800
we've got here.

404
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,630
So what is C transpose?

405
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:14,080
So notice we wanted a
symmetric matrix in the middle

406
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,450
to be able to knock that T out.

407
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,200
And what is A
transpose transpose?

408
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,900
That's A. We've learned
that the thing is symmetric,

409
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:30,540
that if I transpose it
I get it back again.

410
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,160
We're going to see
more about that.

411
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,370
But let me do the
multiplication.

412
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:41,840
So I'm going to
take that, oh, boy.

413
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,100
How am I going to do that?

414
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,660
I want to multiply three
matrices to see what K actually

415
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,440
looks like here.

416
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,330
One question first.

417
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:01,200
Eventually the solution, the
short formula for the solution,

418
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,880
will be u equal K inverse f.

419
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,860
Right?

420
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:11,780
So the answer will be u equal
K inverse f in matrix notation

421
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:16,210
but I'm looking for numbers.

422
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:22,160
And then if I know u then I know
the stretching. e is A times K

423
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,190
inverse f.

424
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:29,680
And w is, I'm just going down
the list, is C times A times

425
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,580
K inverse f.

426
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,500
We've got everything.

427
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,770
So that's the key.

428
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,220
This is the key equation.

429
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,470
That's the answer.

430
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:44,080
Let me ask you about inverses.

431
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,320
What about K inverse?

432
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,050
We took three steps.

433
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:54,030
Now what if I just ask
you about inverses?

434
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,840
This is K inverse that
we would like to know.

435
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:04,650
So again, for inverses
I'm going to start this

436
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:09,690
and I'm going to stop halfway
and you'll tell me why.

437
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,800
If you give me a
product of matrices

438
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,080
and I don't think
particularly much

439
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,080
I'll take the inverse of that
times the inverse of that

440
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,280
times the inverse of that.

441
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:31,490
And what's the matter with that?

442
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,360
You would say, why not
just undo each step?

443
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:45,620
Why not find the w's from
the f's and then the e's from

444
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:52,830
the w's by dividing and
then the u's from the e's?

445
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,510
Why don't we just go
backwards around the loop

446
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,570
rather than what I'm
saying we have to do.

447
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:05,210
We eventually get this
step across with a matrix K

448
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:13,840
that does all three at once.

449
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,710
Well sometimes we
might be able to,

450
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,810
but I don't think
we can in this time.

451
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,280
What's the trouble
with A, that I

452
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,310
don't want to write A inverse?

453
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,290
Well I don't say singular.

454
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,900
What do I say here?

455
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:37,020
Look at this matrix A here.

456
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,650
It's not square.

457
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,780
It's not square, that's right.

458
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:46,700
So I'm not comfortable, I'm
not willing to write A inverse

459
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,070
when A is not a square matrix.

460
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,700
And this distinction, is
the matrix A square or not,

461
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,630
is the first issue.

462
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,090
It's just the picture.

463
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,810
Let me show you an example
of where it would be square.

464
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,590
May I?

465
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:07,060
Before I do this multiplication,
can I jump to a-- I'll

466
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:15,410
change the line of springs
in a way that'll change A.

467
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,940
And let me show
you what happens.

468
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:23,030
Suppose I take out that spring.

469
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:27,800
So I've removed
the fourth spring.

470
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,120
It's a line of springs now,
hanging from a support.

471
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,040
It's a perfectly good problem.

472
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,150
It's problem two, but
it's a different problem.

473
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,040
And what's different now?

474
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,080
There is no fourth spring.

475
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,990
If this was my problem,
what would be different?

476
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,190
There's no fourth spring.

477
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,010
So that's gone.

478
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:56,980
I just have three springs
stretching from three masses.

479
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,740
Then the force
balance is the same.

480
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,690
Everything looks the same
except there's no force,

481
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,680
there's no fourth spring,
so there's no force there,

482
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,330
that's gone.

483
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,940
And of course,
how does C change?

484
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:22,090
So in my new picture now
I have, let me write now,

485
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:27,730
A transpose C A. A is
now three by three,

486
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,550
right, I've lost a row.

487
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,810
A transpose is now
three by three,

488
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,700
I've lost a column, that
fourth spring is gone.

489
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,270
And what is C?

490
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:43,370
Well of course there's
no guy here anymore.

491
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:50,170
What I'm trying to say is for
this problem the matrices have

492
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:54,280
become square.

493
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,890
This would be correct.

494
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:00,280
So this is an especially
nice kind of problem.

495
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,160
It's called statically
determinate.

496
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,830
It means I can determine the
three w's from the three f's.

497
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,850
I can go backwards.

498
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,680
Everything is determined.

499
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,430
The long word for
the fixed-fixed one,

500
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,830
our main example, is
statically indeterminate.

501
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:24,020
I cannot determine four
w's from three forces.

502
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,640
I can't determine what
these internal forces are

503
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:33,330
until I put the whole
loop into one matrix K.

504
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,480
So that's like a warning,
and at the same time,

505
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,690
an important separation.

506
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:45,030
A few nice problems where you
don't have too many springs,

507
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,790
you don't have too
many bars in a truss.

508
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,390
You just have like, the minimum
number to hold it together.

509
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:55,350
Could be statically determinate
and square matrices.

510
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,840
But here we're not square.

511
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,580
Now I go back.

512
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,120
So that would be fixed-free.

513
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,620
Right?

514
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,940
That example that I just
described would be fixed-free

515
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:14,300
and we can kind of carry that
along because we know that what

516
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,570
happens is we lose
a row and a column

517
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:24,070
and a-- c_4 is just not
in the picture anymore.

518
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:32,000
But now I want to go back to the
fixed-fixed one and finish it.

519
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,590
So that's got a support
down there, too.

520
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,710
Key question, what's
this matrix K?

521
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:47,830
This A transpose C A. We
know it's a square matrix,

522
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,920
we know it's a
symmetric matrix, but it

523
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,050
would be really nice to
know what does it look like.

524
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,310
What does that matrix look like?

525
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,410
Can I do the multiplication?

526
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:03,170
So this is going to be K. So
it starts with a three by four.

527
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:08,560
1, -1; 1, -1; 1 -1.

528
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,020
Then it's got the four by
four, c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4.

529
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,390
And then it's got the
transpose of that, which

530
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:22,290
is the 1, -1; 1, -1; 1, -1.

531
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:32,380
With zeroes where I
didn't write anything.

532
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:38,690
We've got three matrices
to multiply together.

533
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,400
What's going to happen here?

534
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,260
Well, let's see.

535
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,100
I guess, why don't I
multiply that by that?

536
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,120
Can I do that?

537
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,690
So that's like getting
two steps together.

538
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,140
It's going to be
easy because of this.

539
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,050
This is usually an easy matrix.

540
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,570
Often diagonal.

541
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,500
So when I do that
multiplication, so let me,

542
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,690
I'll just copy this guy.

543
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:13,100
And now c_1 multiplies that
row, c_2 multiplies this row,

544
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:24,060
c_3 multiplies this row and
c_4 multiplies the last row.

545
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,850
c_1 in that row,
c_2, c_3, and c_4.

546
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,820
And now I'm ready to put
those together into K.

547
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,080
So K will be three by three.

548
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,670
What does it have?

549
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,270
It has c_1+c_2.

550
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:41,010


551
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,730
And then next to that
is going to be this row

552
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,940
one against column
two, there'll be a zero

553
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,800
or they'll be a -c_2 here.

554
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,060
And then when row one
goes against column three

555
00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:02,010
there's nothing.

556
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,790
Why nothing?

557
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:10,540
When do I expect to see a
zero in the overall matrix?

558
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,110
What is it about?

559
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:16,390
So that zero is in
the position 1, 3.

560
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:22,300
What is it about masses
one and three that

561
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,320
is putting that zero in there.

562
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,470
We kind of expect to see that
zero even before we find it.

563
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,780
If I look at the
picture, what do you

564
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,850
notice about masses
one and three that

565
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,420
is going to produce the zero?

566
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,200
They're not connected.

567
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,400
They're not connected.

568
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,620
If I had another spring,
which I could have,

569
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:49,050
connecting mass one to mass
three that would produce,

570
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,700
I'd have another.

571
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,430
I'd be up to five.

572
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,740
Instead of four, there'd
be a fifth spring.

573
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,430
It would have its own constant.

574
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,300
It would show up.

575
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,860
Absolutely could.

576
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,180
Here we don't have it.

577
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,490
Now let me keep going.

578
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,170
I know from symmetry
that the second row

579
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:13,510
times this is going to be
zero, is going to be -c_2.

580
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,270
Symmetric as I expected.

581
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:21,450
What are you expecting on
the diagonal there? c_2+c_3.

582
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:24,310
That's certainly
the right pattern.

583
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,770
Zero, c_2+c_3.

584
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,230
c_2+c_3.

585
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,310
And what are you
expecting over here?

586
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,880
-c_3 is a good guess.

587
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,500
It's seeing that pattern.

588
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,010
Let's just see it happen.

589
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,100
That second row
times this third guy

590
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:51,470
will give me zero, two rows, two
zeroes, and then a -c_3, good.

591
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:55,200
And now we know the zeroes
going to show up here,

592
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,840
the -c_3 is going
to show up here.

593
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,590
And what will show
up here? c_3+c_4.

594
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:13,480


595
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,610
So we've got it.

596
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:18,500
That's the matrix K that
controls this whole problem.

597
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,570
Now we check.

598
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,440
It's square, yes.

599
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,680
It's symmetric, yes.

600
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,550
And notice also it's the kind
of matrix we've seen already.

601
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:35,960
In fact, it's exactly the
matrix we've seen already

602
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,550
Suppose all the c's are one.

603
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:42,820
Suppose every c_1,
c_2, c_3, c_4 is one.

604
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:51,650
Then what's the matrix capital
C in that standard case?

605
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:56,490
C will just be the identity
if these are all ones.

606
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,460
And then I'm only left
with A transpose A.

607
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:08,040
So let me take that
special case below it.

608
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:15,020
Special if so this is if C is
I, what matrix do we have then?

609
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,960
Just to see that we have a
matrix that we know about.

610
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,060
So I'm copying this now here in
the case when all the c's are

611
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,560
one.

612
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,860
So if you put all those c's to
be one, what matrix do you get?

613
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,030
You get, yes.

614
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:38,260
You get the special K.
Right, you get the special.

615
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:43,440
So the work we did to understand
that special matrix pays off

616
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,350
here.

617
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:47,130
Because we know how
that matrix works.

618
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:56,560
And this matrix, well, it's got
four spring constants in it.

619
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:03,400
But we can guess the
important facts about this one

620
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,780
from this one.

621
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:11,210
So what are the important
questions about that matrix?

622
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,840
This is my matrix K now.

623
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,570
What would be, we know it's
square, we know it's symmetric.

624
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,900
What else do we
ask about a matrix?

625
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,240
Well, positive definite, that's
the perfect question, right.

626
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,960
And built into
positive definiteness

627
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,360
would be a property that we
mentioned the very first day.

628
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,850
Is it invertible?

629
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,640
What's your guess?

630
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,160
Is that matrix invertible?

631
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,780
Everybody's going to guess yes
because, if you guessed no,

632
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:50,050
where would you be, the
whole course would end.

633
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:55,480
In fact, the world would
end because the problem

634
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,430
is correctly posed.

635
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:00,630
Those displacements are
determined by the forces

636
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,510
and that just says K is
an invertible matrix.

637
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:06,820
So but how do we see that
it's invertible and, even

638
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,530
more, positive
definite, because that's

639
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,000
the property we now know.

640
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,500
So why is that matrix
positive definite?

641
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,220
Do we want to
check determinants?

642
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,410
We could say, okay,
that guy's positive.

643
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:29,150
We could evaluate this product
and find that it came out well.

644
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:33,140
Would you want to do that one?

645
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:38,000
We could probably do the
two by two determinant.

646
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,470
Could you take that times
that and subtract that?

647
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,130
Let's just write it
above what we would get.

648
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:50,300
Just to see it.

649
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,610
That number times that
number would be a c_1*c_2

650
00:43:54,610 --> 00:44:02,130
and a c_1*c_3 and
a c_2*c_2 twice.

651
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,840
And a c_2*c_3.

652
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,180
And then I would
subtract off this guy.

653
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:13,910
So it would knock
out that, right?

654
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:19,000
And it would leave something
that would be positive.

655
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,340
All the spring constants
are positive here.

656
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:27,030
We're talking normal materials.

657
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,170
I guess, actually,
people are producing now

658
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:34,880
really amazing materials
with amazing properties.

659
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,480
And the amazing property is
a material with a negative c.

660
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:47,360
But that's like-- 18.085
does not allow such a thing.

661
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,320
Right?

662
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,130
All these c's are positive.

663
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,050
And you might guess that the
whole determinant is positive.

664
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:58,930
But now I'd like
you to tell me why.

665
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:07,560
So now we can use our
growing familiarity

666
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:17,870
with matrices to say why is
this matrix positive definite.

667
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:21,900
Is symmetric, of course.

668
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:27,710
Positive definite.

669
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,900
Why?

670
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:36,460
So that's what the previous
lecture helped us to answer.

671
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,730
We've got these
various tests, but what

672
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,910
was the core idea of
positive definiteness?

673
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:46,720
The core idea was
positive energy.

674
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,190
The core idea was I looked at
the energy x trans-- no, u,

675
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,830
sorry.

676
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:56,260
Have to call it u
now. u transpose times

677
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:00,770
that matrix times u.

678
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:08,780
And there was a reason why that
matrix was, why this number,

679
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,150
it's going to be
a number, right?

680
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,220
This combination will
involve all four of these

681
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,470
c's, it'll involve three u's.

682
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:22,470
I don't want to write
out that quantity.

683
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:27,420
It would be, I'll have some
u_1 squareds and some u_1*u_2.

684
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,500
I won't have any
u_1*u_3, because that 1,

685
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,150
3 entry is zero.

686
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:36,670
But why was this positive?

687
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,230
Where do I put the parentheses.

688
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:44,030
Where do I put the parentheses
to see that that's positive?

689
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:50,050
I put them around where?

690
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,340
Around that, good.

691
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:57,940
And around this?

692
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,420
This is really, since we
now have a letter for Au,

693
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:09,040
this is really e
transpose Ce, right?

694
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,990
That's e.

695
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:13,910
This is e, Au, and
this is its transpose.

696
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:17,940
And now what?

697
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,860
So now we've narrowed
it down to C.

698
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:26,050
Oh, we can actually
see why it's an energy.

699
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,240
Remember C is that
diagonal matrix.

700
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,950
What will this be?

701
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:37,570
This is the row of stretchings,
the diagonal matrix of c's,

702
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:40,250
and the column of stretchings.

703
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:45,460
And now if I do that
multiplication, what do I get?

704
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,640
Do you see it?

705
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,610
Because the physics
is coming in.

706
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:53,560
What do I get?

707
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,830
This will multiply that.

708
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,930
So what's the first term
I should write here? e_1?

709
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:01,830


710
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:03,220
What will it be?

711
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,390
I only have diagonal.

712
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,470
In other words, I only
have perfect squares

713
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,420
when I look at this thing.

714
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:16,700
I think I just have c_1*e_1
squared coming from that

715
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,380
diagonal.

716
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,720
That c_1 there,
this e_1 here, this

717
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,950
e_1 there is going
to give me that c_1--

718
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:25,730
What else will I have?

719
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:30,450
c_2*e_2 squared, c_3*e_3
squared and c_4*e_4 squared.

720
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:36,890


721
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:40,520
And do you remember about
springs and Hooke's Law

722
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,360
and energy?

723
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,820
What's the energy in a spring?

724
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,420
This is a stretched spring.

725
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:55,440
So the energy in a stretched
spring, what I wanted to say,

726
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,610
this is the sum of four internal
energies in the four springs

727
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:05,210
but it properly should
have a factor 1/2.

728
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:10,050
There probably, to really
use the word energy properly,

729
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,410
it should be half of all
this, half of all this,

730
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:16,265
half of that's the energy
in the first spring,

731
00:49:16,265 --> 00:49:19,550
the energy in the second,
the energy in the third

732
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:24,760
and the energy in the fourth.

733
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:30,910
But of course our matrix
point was, it's positive.

734
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:33,730
It's a sum of squares
multiplied now

735
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:40,000
by these positive numbers, these
elastic constants, c_1, two,

736
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,300
three and four.

737
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:53,290
So we know the main
facts about that matrix.

738
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,180
We're really at the
point here of we've

739
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:00,590
got some problem
formulated, we've

740
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:04,120
got the essential
facts about the matrix,

741
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:12,020
it's symmetric, positive
definite, certainly invertible.

742
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:20,900
Then there'd be the step
of actually computing u

743
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,760
by solving the
stiffness equation.

744
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,560
Say, for example, Professor
Bathe's big finite element

745
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,730
code, ADINA.

746
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,390
What's the big
picture for ADINA,

747
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:39,540
for any big finite element code?

748
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,880
NASTRAN, ANSYS, whatever.

749
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,680
Abaqus.

750
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,490
There are so many
really good ones.

751
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:50,610
And they've taken years and
years of work to create.

752
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:54,810
But if you look to see what
are the elements that go in,

753
00:50:54,810 --> 00:51:03,240
you choose the model, and
we'll see in the next chapter,

754
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,600
in October we'll see what
finite elements is about,

755
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,960
you have the
material properties,

756
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,660
you assemble the matrix K.

757
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:20,270
That's a key step, is
assembling this matrix K.

758
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:23,750
And then the final step
is solve the system.

759
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,810
Ku=f.

760
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:28,820
But it's assembling that matrix.

761
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,680
Now one thing
popped into my head.

762
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,560
Do I have time to
mention it or not?

763
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:39,440
And there's no class
Monday I think, right?

764
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,040
Can I mention?

765
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,300
Can you hang on one
more second to mention

766
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:51,750
a really remarkable way to
do matrix multiplication.

767
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:54,250
You may say, we know
matrix multiplication.

768
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,120
We got it.

769
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:55,620
Right?

770
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,010
We did it and we got
the right answer.

771
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,500
Can I just show you another way.

772
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,850
And you can like,
see if it works.

773
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:06,490
I did this
multiplication by like,

774
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,740
I'll say rows times columns.

775
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,570
I took rows times columns.

776
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:13,300
That's the usual way.

777
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:17,240
But finite elements and
other, often the right way

778
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,560
is the opposite.

779
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:23,430
It's columns times rows.

780
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:26,290
And of course, this
guy's in here too.

781
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:33,260
You might say, okay, what do
I get from column one times

782
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,050
that number, times row one?

783
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:44,430
Can you do that
multiplication just mentally?

784
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:46,860
Multiply that
column by that row.

785
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:51,100
First of all, what shape
will the answer have?

786
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,163
What shape will the answer
have if I multiply a three

787
00:52:54,163 --> 00:52:57,590
by one times a one by three.

788
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:58,360
Three by three.

789
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,450
It's a full matrix.

790
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:00,690
Columns times rows.

791
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:05,320
And it's a totally legitimate
way to multiply matrices.

792
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,060
That column times
that row will be?

793
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,660
Well you can see
what will it be.

794
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:18,280
And then the c_1 is
going to come into it.

795
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,140
If I just did those
multiplications,

796
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,120
it would just be that.

797
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:28,350
And then the c_1
puts that there.

798
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:30,760
What do I see there?

799
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,310
I see the element matrix.

800
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,910
Do you see that this
is the piece that

801
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:40,750
involved c_1 in the answer?

802
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,470
Well I guess you'll
see it better

803
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:48,750
when I do column two
times c_2 times row two.

804
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,930
So I have to add that guy on.

805
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:54,160
And then I'll leave the other.

806
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,860
What do I get if I do
that column, three by one,

807
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:03,610
times itself as a
row times the c_2.

808
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:06,070
I don't know if you see
what I'm going to get.

809
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:12,240
If you just do that, you'll
see a c_2 will appear here.

810
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,470
And a -c_2 will appear there.

811
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:17,600
And these will be zeroes.

812
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,830
So this was column
one times row one.

813
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,890
This is column
two times row two.

814
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,950
And third and then the fourth.

815
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:28,190
But do you see that
this part is telling me

816
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:30,520
all about the second spring?

817
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:34,450
This part is telling me, what
does the first spring, the c_1,

818
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:39,175
contribute to K. This part
tells me what does the c_2 part,

819
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,450
do you see the c_2 part in K?

820
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:44,580
There, there, minus
there and minus there.

821
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:49,160
The third part from the column
row would be the c_3 part.

822
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,110
And the fourth part
from the fourth spring

823
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:52,860
would be the c_4 part.

824
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,350
So that's a way you
won't have thought of.

825
00:54:56,350 --> 00:55:00,360
But it's the way ADINA
would assemble this matrix.

826
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,290
It would not do
that multiplication.

827
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:05,390
It would do it this
way, columns times rows.

828
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:06,590
We'll see it again.

829
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:10,270
So, hope you have a great
weekend and a holiday Monday

830
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,813
that we all happy about.

831
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:13,313
