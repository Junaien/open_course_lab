00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,430
PROFESSOR STRANG: Starting
today on section 1.3,

10
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,290
actually we'll
finish that today.

11
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:32,050
And that's about the big problem
in, or the most common problem

12
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,270
in scientific computing,
solving a linear system.

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,290
Au=b.

14
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,750
How would you do that?

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,240
So we will certainly do
it for some examples.

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,550
Like our free-fixed or
our fixed-fixed matrices.

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,870
But I thought I'd just
put some comments.

18
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,100
Often I make comments that go
beyond what specific things

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,730
we will do in detail.

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,750
Certainly the
workhorse of-- if I'm

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,500
in MATLAB notation, the
workhorse would be backslash.

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,230
That command is the
quick, natural way

23
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,790
to get the answer u.

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,050
And I want to say
more about backslash.

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,020
I won't be able to say
all the things it does.

26
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,300
There's a lot built
into that command.

27
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,140
And the MATLAB
helpdesk would give

28
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,470
the details of all
the different things

29
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,680
that backslash actually does.

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,600
It looks first, can it divide
the problem into blocks,

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,460
into smaller problems.

32
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,510
It looks to see
if A is symmetric.

33
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,640
If it's symmetric,
because of course,

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,740
that would cut the work
in half because you

35
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,270
know half the matrix
from the other half

36
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,140
in the symmetric case.

37
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,730
It goes hopefully
along and eventually

38
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,850
gives you the answer.

39
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,930
Okay, so I'm going to
say more about that.

40
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,790
Because that's by elimination.

41
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,590
The method there is elimination.

42
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,940
I just thought I would mention
that if I had a large sparse

43
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:22,530
matrix, so I was in sparse
math MATLAB and used backslash,

44
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,510
it would try to
reorder the rows.

45
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,960
Or it will try to reorder
the rows in an optimal way.

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,570
Now, what would
be an optimal way?

47
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,560
Just so you have
an idea of what.

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,910
So elimination takes
this matrix, right?

49
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,310
It's got all its rows.

50
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,620
And we'll do examples.

51
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:51,020
So the idea of elimination
is that it produces a zero.

52
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,070
So let's suppose it accepts
the first row as the pivot row.

53
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,590
And this (1, 1) entry
would be the pivot.

54
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,020
And then how does
it use the pivot?

55
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,980
It subtracts multiples of that
pivot row from the other rows

56
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,610
in order to get zeroes
in the first column.

57
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,270
So then it has a
new matrix that's

58
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,460
like it's one size smaller.

59
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,610
And then it just
continues all the way

60
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:28,180
until it gets to a
triangular matrix

61
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,190
with all the pivots sitting
there on the diagonal.

62
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,240
So that's the idea
of elimination.

63
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,220
And we'll do small examples.

64
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,230
So why would you want
to reorder the rows?

65
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,560
Two reason, two good reasons
for reordering the rows.

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,400
One reason which
MATLAB will always do,

67
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,830
unless it has some
good reason not to,

68
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:03,960
is if that pivot is too small
compared to numbers below it

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,730
it will pick the largest and
reorder to put the largest

70
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,170
pivot up there.

71
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,880
So you like large pivots.

72
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,340
Why do you like large pivots?

73
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,910
Because for numerical
stability that

74
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,180
gives you small multipliers.

75
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,750
If this is the biggest number
then all the multiples that you

76
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,890
need, the multiple
of that row that you

77
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:35,150
want to subtract from the other
rows will be less than one.

78
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,750
The multiplier is, so
just let's remember,

79
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:51,610
the multiplier is the entry to
eliminate divided by the pivot.

80
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,020
So if that entry
to be eliminated

81
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,730
is smaller then the pivot, then
the multiplier's less than one

82
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,920
and things stay stable.

83
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,170
So that's a picture
of elimination,

84
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,760
a sort of first picture.

85
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,230
And if it's sparse that means
there's a lot of zeroes.

86
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,440
And where would we like
those zeroes to be?

87
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,890
Where would we
like to find zeroes

88
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,850
to save time and use
to avoid all the steps,

89
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,180
to avoid going
through every step.

90
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:33,430
If this was already a
zero then it's there

91
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,360
and we don't need
to get it there.

92
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,700
The job is already done.

93
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,160
We can go forward.

94
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,160
And if we have a
zero here then it's

95
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,120
already zero in the next
one and we don't have to do,

96
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,820
that would be the
second pivot row,

97
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,350
we don't have to
subtract it from this row

98
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,610
because a zero is already there.

99
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,490
So we like zeroes.

100
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,740
And sparse matrices
have a lot of them.

101
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,870
But we only like them if
they're in the right place.

102
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,240
And what's the right place?

103
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,140
It's, roughly speaking,
it's the beginning of a row.

104
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,550
So we're very happy
with, we would

105
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,400
like to get an ordering that
looks somehow like this.

106
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,080
We would like to get a
bunch of zeroes in there.

107
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,500
Well that's, I
really overdid it.

108
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,670
Maybe we can't get that many.

109
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,630
But my point is,
you see the point

110
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,990
that those are at the
beginning of the rows.

111
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:34,270
So let's say we can't quite
get to that, but maybe

112
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,750
something more like that.

113
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,480
Zero.

114
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,450
So we get some rows starting
with zeroes and then we get

115
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:47,121
rows that don't.

116
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:49,620
Which of course, I mean, they
were there in the first place.

117
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,260
What we've done is move
them to the bottom.

118
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,340
And the reason for
moving them to the bottom

119
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:00,820
is that they don't
destroy rows below them.

120
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,390
I didn't show how
that would happen.

122
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,040
Suppose I had a number there.

123
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,830
Suppose that wasn't a zero.

124
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,540
And all these were.

125
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,450
Then when I do that elimination
I subtract a multiple

126
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,130
of that row from this row.

127
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,250
Do you see that those
zeroes will fill in?

128
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,730
So fill in is the bad thing
that you're trying to avoid.

129
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,110
So in this quick
discussion of reordering

130
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,650
you're trying to order the rows
so that they start with zeroes

131
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,460
for as long as you can because
those zeroes will never

132
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,440
fill in.

133
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,820
Zeroes inside a band, yes,
just to make the point again,

134
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,230
suppose I have a long row.

135
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:51,420
Then if I have some zeroes
here, here, here, useless.

136
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:58,100
Because when I go to do
elimination on these rows, when

137
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,710
I subtract a multiple of
that row from that row,

138
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,910
that zero will fill in,
it didn't help, it's gone.

139
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,390
And this and this.

140
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,440
So zeroes sort of
near the diagonal

141
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,070
are often going to fill in.

142
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:16,150
It's zeroes at the far
left that are good.

143
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,100
So that's a discussion
of a topic that

144
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,050
actually comes into 18.086.

145
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,960
And so does the third words
that I thought I would just

146
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,820
write on the board.

147
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,570
So this would be topic
specializing in how do you

148
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,420
solve large systems.

149
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,580
And reordering with
elimination is one way.

150
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,760
And a second approach is, I
just put these words up here

151
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,480
so that you've seen them.

152
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,320
Conjugate gradient
method, that's

153
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,340
a giant success in solving
symmetric problems.

154
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,750
Large symmetric problems.

155
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:59,640
Something called multigrid
is a terrific, incomplete LU.

156
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:06,440
People have worked hard on ideas
for solving problems so large

157
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,560
that this becomes too expensive.

158
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,070
But backslash is
the natural choice.

159
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,650
If you can do it, it's
like it's so simple.

160
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,030
So let me focus on backslash.

161
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,640
So backslash is the
key to talk about.

162
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,590
Let me see, let's just think
what does backslash do?

163
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:33,150
Suppose I had two equations,
two different right-hand sides,

164
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:40,500
b and c with the same matrix
A. Would I solve them,

165
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,600
would I do u=A\b and
then separately A\c?

166
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,890
No.

167
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,800
If I had two equations
with the same matrix,

168
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:58,310
there's a big saving in, suppose
I have two equations, two,

169
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,840
well, can I put it?

170
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,080
I'll make a matrix.

171
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,710
I mean this is what
MATLAB would always do.

172
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:11,070
Put those two right-hand
sides into a matrix.

173
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,700
Then backslash is
happy with that.

174
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,890
That backslash command
would solve both equations.

175
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,210
It would give you the
answer then, would be,

176
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,290
it would be two parts to it.

177
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,310
What would be the
first column of u then?

178
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,110
So, do you see what I have now?

179
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,510
I have a square matrix
A times an unknown u.

180
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,260
And I've got two
right-hand sides.

181
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,400
The point is this often happens.

182
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,260
If you're doing, say,
a design problem.

183
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,980
You might try different designs.

184
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,300
So those different designs give
you different right-hand sides.

185
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,410
And then you have
a problem to solve.

186
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,710
What's the response
to those designs?

187
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,900
What are the displacements,
what happens?

188
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,270
So you want to solve
with two right-hand sides

189
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:10,310
and the point is you don't want
to go through the elimination

190
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,810
process on A twice.

191
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,350
That's crazy.

192
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,080
You see how that
elimination process on A

193
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,430
has this, what I described
here, didn't look at b.

194
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,140
I didn't even get to the
right-hand side part.

195
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,330
I was dealing with the expensive
part, which is the matrix A.

196
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,790
So we don't want to
pay that price twice.

197
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,740
And therefore backslash
is all set up.

198
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,010
So what's the first
column of u then?

199
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,820
It's A\b.

200
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,750
And now what's
another way to write,

201
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,560
a more mathematical
way to write A?

202
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,020
What's the answer to Au=b.

203
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,380


204
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,120
It's u equals A
inverse b, right?

205
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,020
That's the answer
in the first column

206
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,770
and A inverse c would be the
answer in the second column.

207
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,320
So it would produce
those answers.

208
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,130
Backslash will
produce the answer

209
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,660
to the first equation and the
answer the second equation.

210
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,240
Will it do that by
finding A inverse?

211
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,150
No.

212
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,000
A inverse, for
multiple reasons, we

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,380
don't often compute,
if it's 3 by 3, 4 by 4,

214
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,960
then it's not a bad idea to
see what A inverse looks like.

215
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,430
We'll do that
actually, because it's

216
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,510
very enlightening if
the matrix is small,

217
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,310
you can see what's going on.

218
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,310
But for a large problem
we don't want A inverse.

219
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,920
We want the answer.

220
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,680
And backslash goes
to the answer.

221
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:53,000
It doesn't get there
by computing A inverse.

222
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,650
And our examples will show how.

223
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:05,600
So I'm giving A inverse a
little bad comments right now.

224
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
So I maybe should
finish that sentence

225
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,030
and then you'll
see me turn around

226
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,750
and compute the darn thing.

227
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,950
But why do we not use A inverse?

228
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,250
Two reasons.

229
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,630
One is it's more expensive.

230
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,920
If I have to compute A
inverse and multiply by b,

231
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,170
that's taking too long.

232
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:32,780
Second reason is A inverse could
easily be a full, dense matrix.

233
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,210
All non-zero.

234
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,640
Where A itself was
like, tridiagonal.

235
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,570
So if A is tridiagonal,
all the numbers we need

236
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,510
are there in three diagonals,
we don't want A inverse,

237
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,270
you'll see, A inverse is full.

238
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,290
So two reasons for
not using A inverse.

239
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,990
Takes too long in the first
place even in the good case

240
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,630
and often our matrix
A has got lots

241
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:07,750
of zeroes that are not there in
A inverse so we've wasted time.

242
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,660
Nevertheless let
me say something

243
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:16,140
about A inverse
on the next board.

244
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,260
I don't know if you ever thought
about the inverse matrix.

245
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,540
Let me ask you this question.

246
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:33,390
Suppose I use the command
A\I. What's that doing?

247
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,700
That's putting the identity
on the right-hand side

248
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,500
instead of a single
vector b or instead

249
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,950
of two vectors b and
c I'm now putting n.

250
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,340
That's okay.

251
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,290
Backslash will work with that.

252
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,590
That's a shorthand for solving.

253
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,150
This solves all these equations.

254
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,190
A, it'll get my different
answers, u_1, u_2.

255
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,750
It'll get n different answers
from the n right-hand sides,

256
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,520
the columns of I. Let
me take to be three.

257
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,440
0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1.

258
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:19,720
But I'll take n to be three.

259
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,230
That's the identity.

260
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,850
So this solves that equation.

261
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,070
A\I will output
u, will output u.

262
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,350
And here's the question.

263
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,750
What have I got?

264
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:38,450
If you have a matrix A,
square matrix and of course

265
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:44,830
you have to create I as
eye(3), that I would be,

266
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,860
this would be eye(3).

267
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,070
Cleve Moler's lousy pun.

268
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,120
So what would I get?

269
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,810
What would I get?

270
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,310
The inverse, yes.

271
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,840
I'd get the inverse.

272
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,540
I'd get the inverse matrix.

273
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,890
A backslash-- why's that?

274
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,900
Because what matrix
solves, what's

275
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,970
the solution u to A
times something equal I?

276
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:20,290
The solution to--
This equation is Au=I.

277
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,370
The solution to that equation
is the inverse matrix.

278
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,250
u will be A inverse.

279
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,530
So that is a pretty,
I mean, that's pretty,

280
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,750
if I wanted A inverse
that's a good way to do it.

281
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,410
Other ways to do it
would be inv(A) in MATLAB

282
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:44,980
and other ways, but this is
about as good as you get.

283
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:51,410
Do you see that you get the
inverse matrix that way?

284
00:16:51,410 --> 00:17:03,340
And it's worth giving
some words to that fact.

285
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,890
How would I describe this?

286
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:10,410
This is a set of three
different problems.

287
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:18,170
I would describe [1, 0, 0], that
right-hand side, as an impulse.

288
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,230
That's an impulse.

289
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:26,580
A delta vector with an impulse
in the first component.

290
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,250
I'd call that an impulse
in the second component.

291
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,610
I'd call that an impulse
in the third component.

292
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:37,110
So my inputs are three
impulses and my outputs

293
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,990
are u_1, u_2, u_3.

294
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,380
What words might I use?

295
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,400
I could call those
impulse response.

296
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,820
If I were in Course
6, I certainly would.

297
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,570
These would be impulses,
these would be the responses

298
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,410
to that impulse from our system.

299
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,760
So those are impulse responses
but in linear algebra

300
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,710
the words I would
use, u_1, u_2, u_3

301
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,830
are the columns of
A inverse, right?

302
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,160
That's what we just
said. u_1, u_2, u_3.

303
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,090
So the columns of--
Let me write that down.

304
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:24,020
The columns of A inverse
are the responses,

305
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:33,430
the u's, the solutions to
the impulses, to n impulses.

306
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:41,520
And these are the
columns of I. Do you see?

307
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,280
Nothing I've said so
far is deep or anything.

308
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,570
But it's just, this
comes up so much

309
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,320
that it's nice to have different
ways to think about this.

310
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,430
And actually, yeah, if
I had to solve by hand,

311
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:05,680
if I had to find the inverse
by hand I would use elimination

312
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,080
on this system of equations.

313
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,770
I would take A and put
the identity next to it.

314
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,210
I would do elimination a lot.

315
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,610
Actually I'll put that in one.

316
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:24,610
If I had to find the inverse I
would take this block matrix.

317
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,060
Is that the first block
matrix we've seen?

318
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:34,690
Block matrices are really,
you should just get familiar,

319
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,890
when you're getting
familiar with matrices,

320
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,590
they often come in blocks.

321
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,320
So here's a three
by three block,

322
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,590
here's a three by three
block, the whole matrix

323
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,530
is three by six.

324
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,720
I can go through the
elimination steps on it.

325
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,640
If I really go
haywire on elimination

326
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,280
and keep going and going and
going all the way until A gets

327
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,330
to the identity,
so I do elimination

328
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,890
and I get it triangular
then I even clean out up

329
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,680
above the pivots and then I
change all the pivots to one,

330
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,490
I can get all the
way to the identity

331
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,450
if the matrix is invertible.

332
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:17,950
And what do you think will
show up in the right half?

333
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,690
A inverse, yeah.

334
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,380
So A inverse will show up there.

335
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,920
So in 18.06 I would
explain, go through examples

336
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:35,070
of this computation just
to see A inverse appear.

337
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,010
There's no reason for us
to go through long examples

338
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,780
like that.

339
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,630
Maybe one three by three
would be worth doing,

340
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:49,900
but in the big picture we're
going to use backslash.

341
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,280
Questions or discussion.

342
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,520
So this is the sort of overall
picture about the inverse.

343
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,660
Well this is about the inverse.

344
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,120
This was about elimination.

345
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,570
I've gotta take a little
time on elimination.

346
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,530
No it's just too important.

347
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,960
It's sort of straightforward
and mechanical

348
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,420
but it's like, too
important to blow away.

349
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:23,420
So let me remove that and
put something better there.

350
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,970
So now I'm talking
about elimination.

351
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,460
I'm talking about one equation.

352
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,840
I'm back to Au=b.

353
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,710
Au=b.

354
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:41,650
And notice I'm using the
letter A rather than K or one

355
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,050
of our special letters
because right now I don't know

356
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,640
that that's a special matrix.

357
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,880
In a minute the
example I do will

358
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,600
be one of our special
matrices of course,

359
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,690
and then I'll use its letter.

360
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,400
Just a word, though.

361
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,920
I thought I would take-- you're
getting a lot of big picture

362
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,780
here for a minute and then
we'll get into the details.

363
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,740
I thought I would
just, like, this

364
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,880
is an occasion to look ahead.

365
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,870
To say a word about the big
picture of linear algebra.

366
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:22,040
It's got four major
problems, linear algebra.

367
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,270
And there are four commands
to solve those problems.

368
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,570
And those commands,
why not know?

369
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,590
So those commands are: lu.

370
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:36,970
I'm speaking about MATLAB
notation but Octave, Scilab,

371
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:42,950
Python, R, all other
would have those.

372
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,060
Would do these same things.

373
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:53,070
So lu is the command
that produces this,

374
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,110
but I didn't say
what that is yet.

375
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,080
Ooh.

376
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,960
So that's my job, right.

377
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,090
What does this mean?

378
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,770
What's up there?

379
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,480
So, okay, to nobody's
surprise MATLAB thought, okay,

380
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,110
lu was a good letter for that.

381
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,680
And what did MATLAB think of as
a good letter for the command

382
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,900
that does this? qr.

383
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:29,870
So if I did lu(A) or qr(A)
I would get-- I mean,

384
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,170
this is sometimes associated
with the names of Gram-Schmidt.

385
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,990
It makes vectors orthogonal.

386
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,660
Not to worry about this stuff.

387
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,980
You can like, close your
eyes for a moment here.

388
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,110
lu is the first command and
that's what today's about.

389
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:51,740
qr is the key command for
least squares problems.

390
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,780
Maybe the biggest application
of rectangular matrices,

391
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,810
I'm sure that's the big.

392
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,330
Eigenvalues, do you
know about eigenvalues?

393
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,860
Well we'll just name
the command eig(A).

394
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,980
And the singular
value decomposition,

395
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:18,050
which you may never have heard
of, but you will, is svd(A).

396
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,560
Can I leave that?

397
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,530
It's in the videotape now.

398
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:32,440
And my point is that when
we've spoken about those four,

399
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,500
we really have got
numerical linear algebra

400
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:42,120
and a lot of pure linear
algebra explained.

401
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,760
These are the four big ones.

402
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,700
And I guess what I'm
saying is, the four

403
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:53,800
big problems of linear algebra
turn out to, a good way

404
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:59,220
to describe the answer is as
a factorization of the matrix.

405
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,200
This is a factor.

406
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,160
So now let me say
what this one is.

407
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,490
I start with a matrix and
what elimination is really

408
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,030
doing, if you look to
see what is it doing,

409
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,930
it's producing a
lower triangular

410
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,330
times an upper triangular.

411
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,300
Let's go directly to that.

412
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,910
Let me go directly to that.

413
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,390
Let me take an example.

414
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,790
So here's my matrix.

415
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:34,310
Well, I don't have to call it
A because you recognize it.

416
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,000
So what's our name
for that matrix?

417
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,140
T. T because the top
boundary condition is free.

418
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,200
Oh, that reminds me.

419
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,710
Some good comments after class
Friday brought out something

420
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,900
that I sloughed over.

421
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:58,210
That the free-fixed matrix,
the free-fixed problem

422
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:02,340
is usually one unknown
larger than the fixed-fixed.

423
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,370
Because remember the fixed-fixed
problem had both ends fixed.

424
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,410
They were not unknowns.

425
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:12,340
The only unknowns were one,
two, three to n in the middle.

426
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,880
But people noticed when I was
talking about the free boundary

427
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,640
condition that u_0 came into
it and u_0 is not known.

428
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,120
So really, the free
boundary condition like,

429
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,040
has an extra unknown, an extra
row and column in the matrix

430
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,600
and that's correct.

431
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,620
We'll see later in
Fourier transforms

432
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,190
cosine matrices are one size
bigger than sine matrices.

433
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,170
The cosine matrices
are free-free

434
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,880
and the sine matrices
are fixed-fixed.

435
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,670
And now here we're
at free-fixed.

436
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:59,060
I want to do elimination
on that matrix.

437
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,680
And while I'm at it,
we'll find the inverse.

438
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,280
But let's do elimination.

439
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,310
Just on that matrix.

440
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:15,660
Just to see what this
L and U stuff is.

441
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,480
What do we do?

442
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,980
The first pivot is?

443
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,740
One, it's fine.

444
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,090
Not going to worry about that.

445
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,150
We'll use it now.

446
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,790
So how do I use it?

447
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,545
I use a pivot, now
listen because here

448
00:27:32,545 --> 00:27:36,350
is a convention here, I'm
going to use the word subtract.

449
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:41,030
You would say add that
row to that row, right?

450
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,030
Because you want
to get a zero here.

451
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,490
Forgive me for making
it sound harder.

452
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,700
I'm going to say subtract
because I like subtraction.

453
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,650
Subtract minus one of
that row, my multiplier

454
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,480
is minus one here.

455
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,210
I'm going to say subtract minus
one of that row from that.

456
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,200
Same thing.

457
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,620
You'll say okay.

458
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,640
No problem.

459
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,110
Let's just do it.

460
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:14,600
So there's the pivot row and
now when I-- shall I just add?

461
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:23,830
When I add that to that, or
as my superego is saying,

462
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:27,460
subtract minus one
of that from that.

463
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,370
What do I get?

464
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:33,140
I get the zero, the
one and the minus one.

465
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,500
And then what do I get?

466
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,270
What's the multiplier?

467
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:42,590
So let's just put these l,
these multipliers, the l_(2, 1).

468
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,450
That's the multiplier.

469
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,330
2, 1 refers to row
two, column one.

470
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,870
And this step got the zero
in row two, column one.

471
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,330
And what was the
multiplier that did it?

472
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,060
It's the number that I
multiplied row one by

473
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:02,820
and subtracted from row
two, so it was minus one.

474
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,410
What's l_(3,1)?

475
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,250
What's the multiplier that
produces a zero in the three,

476
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,800
row three, column one position?

477
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,770
It's zero.

478
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,320
I take zero of this
row away from this row

479
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,460
because it's zero already.

480
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,540
So I'm not going to change, that
row won't change and l_(3,1)

481
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,380
was zero.

482
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,080
Now I know the next pivot.

483
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,890
I'm ready to use it.

484
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,040
I want to get a zero
below it because I'm

485
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,580
aiming at this
upper triangular U.

486
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,060
And what's the multiplier now?

487
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,810
And what's its number?

488
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,670
What's the multiplier number?

489
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:55,000
3, 2 because I'm trying to
fix row three, column two.

490
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,560
And what do I multiply
this by and subtract

491
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,540
from this to make it zero?

492
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,470
It's negative one again.
negative one, right.

493
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,390
It's negative one.

494
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,670
Sorry.

495
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,320
Right.

496
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,320
And now what happens
when I do that?

497
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,370
Can I just do it in place here?

498
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,310
Forgive me if I just
add that to that.

499
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:25,240
And I'll get zero and one.

500
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,929
And now what do I know at this
point, what have I learned?

501
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,470
The most important
thing I've learned

502
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,930
is the matrix is invertible.

503
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:38,580
Because the pivots
one, one, and one,

504
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,710
well they're all
here on the diagonal.

505
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:45,730
This is my matrix U. That's
my upper triangular matrix.

506
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,660
And-- yeah, of course?

507
00:30:48,660 --> 00:31:03,150
I'm subtracting
from this, so I've

508
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,860
got the two is there,
yeah, yeah, that's right.

509
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:11,540
So the two is sitting there
and I'm subtracting minus one

510
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:16,800
of that row from it and that
would mean taking, yeah, yeah.

511
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,200
Right.

512
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,827
That would mean I'm
subtracting one from the two

513
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:21,660
and getting the one.

514
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,710
Yeah, yeah.

515
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,410
So the row, the
typical entry is,

516
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,870
the typical result is:
the row you have minus

517
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,380
l times the pivot row.

518
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,650
The row you have minus the
multiplier times the pivot row.

519
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:39,690
That's the operation that
elimination lives on.

520
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,410
Elimination does
that all the time.

521
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,800
It's one of the basic
linear algebra subroutines.

522
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,610
B L A S.

523
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:54,710
Now, this is my U. So that's
the goal of elimination,

524
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,000
get it upper triangular.

525
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,770
And the reason is, you can solve
upper triangular systems really

526
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,480
fast.

527
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,940
These multipliers l, l_(2,1),
and so on, they and go

528
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,420
into the L matrix.

529
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,010
And now, let me just say
it here that in a way,

530
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,820
that example is too beautiful.

531
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:25,080
Seldom am I sorry to see an
example come out beautifully,

532
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,320
but why do I say this
is too beautiful?

533
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,300
It's not typical.

534
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,270
If I had other numbers here, I
would get to other numbers here

535
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:37,930
and what would be the
difference, typically?

536
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:44,640
The pivots wouldn't be all ones.

537
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,140
That's what's too beautiful
here, but let's go with it.

538
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,810
I mean, it was worth it because
everything came out simple.

539
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,450
But the pivots for
another problem, ooh,

540
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:03,000
let me just do a
second problem here.

541
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,920
I'll do the fixed-fixed guy.

542
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,620
Okay, so let's just do
elimination on that.

543
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,730
That's the first pivot.

544
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,520
Subtract.

545
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:17,471
Now what's the multiplier now?

546
00:33:17,471 --> 00:33:18,720
You're not as quick as MATLAB.

547
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,080
MATLAB is ahead of you.

548
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,120
So the multiplier is -1/2.

549
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,700
So the multiplier
is, l_(2,1) is -1/2.

550
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,470
l_(3,1) will again be
zero and let's use it,

551
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,860
so it knocks that guys out.

552
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,850
And what did that
number come out to be?

553
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,550
Do you remember?

554
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,240
That was 3/2.

555
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,270
I think we looked at that once.

556
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,990
And that would be all the same.

557
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:52,310
And then the next multiplier,
l_(3,2) will be negative 2/3

558
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,280
because when I multiply that
by 2/3 it gives me the negative

559
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:02,200
one and then I subtract and
it kills this and I get 4/3.

560
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,400
I just did that quickly.

561
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:11,730
And my main point was the
pivots are on the diagonal.

562
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,910
They're not all ones now.

563
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,490
So this is a more typical one.

564
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:24,220
This is, again our U.
And our L matrix will be,

565
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,220
oh, oh, that's the point.

566
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,200
That these l's,
these multipliers

567
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,900
fit right into a lower
triangular matrix.

568
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,200
All these multipliers,
and we'll put ones

569
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,840
on the diagonal of that guy
and these lower triangular ones

570
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,490
will fit in just right
perfectly in there.

571
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:51,590
Over here the L would be,
let me construct the L.

572
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,750
Ones on the diagonal
representing

573
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,708
the pivot rows that stayed
put and minus one, zero,

574
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:10,020
and minus one as the multipliers
that-- So this was L,

575
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:16,150
the multipliers that we used.

576
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,350
One more.

577
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,870
We're doing lots of good
stuff here and it's not deep,

578
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:29,450
but it's-- Suppose the
matrix had been singular.

579
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:34,210
We have to realize, okay, this
elimination method is great.

580
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,940
But it can break down and
it's going to break down,

581
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,630
it has to break down somehow
if the matrix is singular.

582
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:46,110
Now what's our example of
a singular matrix here?

583
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:50,420
The matrix, this is free-fixed
and that by fixing one

584
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,190
support it wasn't singular,
but if I want to make it

585
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,610
singular, what'll I take?

586
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,210
Free-free.

587
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,390
Free-free matrix.

588
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:04,170
So can I, if I had thought
to bring colored chalk,

589
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,400
I'll just erase for a
moment for the bad case.

590
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,020
The bad case would be free-free.

591
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,430
And how would it show up
as bad in elimination.

592
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:21,810
How does a singular
matrix reveal itself

593
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,390
as elimination goes forward?

594
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:29,776
Because you can't
tell at the beginning.

595
00:36:29,776 --> 00:36:30,900
What would have gone wrong?

596
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,280
We would have had a zero there.

597
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,540
We had a two that
dropped to one.

598
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,310
But if we start with a
one, it'll drop to zero.

599
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,580
That would have
been a zero there.

600
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:49,460
The matrix would not
have had three pivots.

601
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,070
This upper triangular
matrix is singular, no good.

602
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,780
And that tells us back there
that the original matrix

603
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,530
is singular, no good.

604
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:04,230
So if I can't get to
three pivots somehow,

605
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:09,990
the matrix'll be singular and
that's an example that is.

606
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,870
And MATLAB would immediately
tell us, of course.

607
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:17,510
So let's go back to the good
case for the main point.

608
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,100
The good case for
the main point.

609
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:26,050
So the good case
was three pivots.

610
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,110
In fact it was extra
good because they all

611
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,030
turned out to be ones.

612
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:36,410
Now, oh, now we're ready for LU.

613
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,120
Here's the magic.

614
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,580
And I'm not giving a proof.

615
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:48,300
The magic is that the result
U, if I multiply the multiplier

616
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,640
matrix L times
the result U, I'll

617
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:59,500
bring back A. I'll bring
back A. So let me just see.

618
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:05,100
If I multiply L by U, so
this is now L times U,

619
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:09,500
maybe you can see that
I get A. So what is U?

620
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:15,890
I just have to copy it.
[1, 1,  1; -1, -1, 0].

621
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:22,900
I could fill in the zeroes
but I know they're there.

622
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,210
That's L times U.
And sure enough,

623
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,620
if I do the multiplication,
this-- How would

624
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,940
you to that multiplication?

625
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,970
I would say this is one of
the first row when I see that.

626
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,790
1, 0, 0 multiplying these.

627
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,220
I'd say get one
of the first row.

628
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,630
That's correct in A. Here I
would say this is minus one

629
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,670
of the first row, plus
one of the second row,

630
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:48,330
and sure enough it's
the right part of A.

631
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,820
And this is minus one
of the second row,

632
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,460
plus one of the third row,
and sure enough it's the right

633
00:38:53,460 --> 00:39:00,620
third row of A. I get A. And
that's when elimination goes

634
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,870
through with no zero
pivots, no problems,

635
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:10,620
just a bunch of multipliers,
then that wonderful description

636
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:15,170
of it, A=LU is correct.

637
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,140
I don't know how
many that's new to.

638
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,270
I should maybe
have thought ahead.

639
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,640
How many have seen
like, L times U before?

640
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,420
Just to give me an idea?

641
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,020
Quite a few.

642
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,970
Okay.

643
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:31,850
So it's terrific.

644
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:34,330
Oh, here I would
get L times U. Now

645
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,380
this is like a little more
interesting because the pivots

646
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,800
were not ones.

647
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,780
So that's my matrix U. And
here's my matrix L, right?

648
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,710
Okay, big point.

649
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:56,650
Because we're so interested in
symmetric matrices and this one

650
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,770
in particular, or that one,
symmetric matrices are good.

651
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:05,490
Now, I'm unhappy
about one aspect.

652
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:10,470
So now there's just
one part of this.

653
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:14,510
This was great, we got three
non-zero pivots, we got to U,

654
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:18,170
we got the multiplier
matrix all fine

655
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:21,740
and we would be ready
for the right-hand side

656
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,231
and we would be ready
for two right-hand sides,

657
00:40:24,231 --> 00:40:26,480
we would even be ready for
all three right-hand sides,

658
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,580
whatever.

659
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,660
But I have one criticism.

660
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:39,950
The matrix A which was
our K, this was really K,

661
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,780
was symmetric.

662
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,040
That was the very first
thing you did, told me

663
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,490
on the very first day.

664
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,670
And now it's equal to L
times U, but what's happened?

665
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,250
The symmetry is lost.

666
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:56,100
Somehow the L has
ones on the diagonal,

667
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,130
the U as we have it has
pivots on the diagonal,

668
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,860
now the pivots are not all ones.

669
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,630
So you see the symmetry
of the problem got lost,

670
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,970
and that shouldn't happen.

671
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,920
And there ought to
be a way to get back.

672
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,530
Okay.

673
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:15,390
And now I want to describe the
way to get back to symmetry.

674
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:19,130
So LU doesn't keep the symmetry.

675
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,200
L has ones, U has pivots.

676
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,370
Different.

677
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:29,470
But a very simple idea will
bring back the symmetry.

678
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:37,430
That is peel off the pivots
into a diagonal matrix.

679
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:40,100
In other words,
there's a matrix,

680
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:45,500
I'll call it D, D for diagonal.

681
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,940
I'll divide those
numbers out of each row.

682
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,240
And can I just do that?

683
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,110
So I'm just going
to write this U

684
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,520
as a product of this
diagonal D where I'm going

685
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,460
to be dividing the two out.

686
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,040
So when I divide the
two out from that row

687
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,690
I'm left with 1, -1/2, 0.

688
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,470
And when I divide
3/2, the pivot then,

689
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,410
it makes that pivot
into a one and what

690
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,930
does it produce for that guy?

691
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:22,480
When I divide 3/2, when I divide
that -1 by 3/2, what do I get?

692
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,330
I get negative, division will
be 2/3, I'll get a negative 2/3.

693
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:32,960
And now, on the last row I'm
dividing that row by 4/3.

694
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,210
When I divide that row by
4/3, what row do I get here?

695
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,680
[0, 0, 1].

696
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,940
Because I've made the pivots
one, well they're not pivots.

697
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,730
What I've done is
separate out the pivots.

698
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:51,310
So I've made the diagonal ones
just by separating it out.

699
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:58,790
And what's happened?

700
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:01,980
My goal was to get
back some symmetry that

701
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,880
was there at the start.

702
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:10,430
Now so I have a pivot matrix
D, and what's that matrix?

703
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,930
You could say,
well, it's the rest.

704
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,640
But that's not what
I'm looking for.

705
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,920
What is it?

706
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,350
Can everybody have a look at it?

707
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,220
I can't raise it.

708
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:26,950
If you look at what we
got there, what is it?

709
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,945
What's the right
name to give it?

710
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:30,820
L transpose, exactly!

711
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,290
That's the right name.

712
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,400
L transpose.

713
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,200
So what am I concluding then?

714
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,170
I'm concluding that, let's
see, where shall I put this?

715
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,350
And it'll come back to it.

716
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:49,050
Well, here we had just to
show it wasn't an accident,

717
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,610
here we had L L
transpose and what

718
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:56,970
was the pivot matrix in this
too beautiful problem case?

719
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,630
It was the identity.

720
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,530
So we didn't notice it.

721
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,600
So can I squeeze
in the identity?

722
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,580
That's the pivot matrix there.

723
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:08,810
But and again, we had
L times L transpose.

724
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,440
The beauty was there,
the symmetry was there.

725
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,920
And now what's the usual thing?

726
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:21,180
So really I'm completing
this to one more thought.

727
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,700
In that case when
A is symmetric.

728
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:28,940
I'm completing, I have the
L. I'm factoring out the D.

729
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,730
And what's left is L transpose.

730
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:43,540
I hope you like LDL^T.
Seeing a matrix on one side

731
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,230
and the transpose
on the other side,

732
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:50,960
the matrix L at the left and L
transpose at the right is just

733
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,730
right.

734
00:44:52,730 --> 00:45:08,330
So the point of
symmetric case we have,

735
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,030
and I'll use the
letter K rather than A

736
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,950
because now we're getting the
matrix that's more special.

737
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:18,060
It's that K or
it's this T or it's

738
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,750
any other symmetric matrix.

739
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:25,850
The elimination leads
to, uses multipliers L

740
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,810
and if I factor out
the pivot matrix

741
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,250
then the other part
is L transpose.

742
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,910
We've seen that just by example.

743
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:39,560
By two examples.

744
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,420
Now I want to just look at that.

745
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:50,420
Because this that describes not
only the result of elimination

746
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:56,840
which is the key operation,
but it also keeps the symmetry.

747
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:03,500
In fact every matrix of
that sort is symmetric.

748
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,930
No, yeah, that's important.

749
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:13,140
This is sure to be symmetric.

750
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:21,980
We will often see matrices
multiplied by their transpose.

751
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,210
So what I'm saying is
that if you gave me

752
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:30,160
any matrix L, any diagonal
matrix D, and then

753
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,570
the transpose of L, if
I multiplied those out,

754
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,980
I would get a symmetric matrix.

755
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,150
And going the other way, if I
started with a symmetric matrix

756
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:40,810
and I did elimination
and got an L,

757
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:44,530
then the D factoring out
would leave me L transpose.

758
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:48,660
So what you've
seen by example is

759
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,540
what will happen all the time.

760
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:57,050
Now why is that
matrix symmetric?

761
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:02,410
Here we get a chance to show
the power of matrix notation,

762
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:03,580
really.

763
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:07,950
I just think that if I have
any matrix L, in this case

764
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,210
it happened to be lower
triangular, but if I have

765
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:14,580
any matrix L and I have a
nice, symmetric diagonal guy

766
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,610
in the middle and I
have the transpose

767
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,600
of this matrix on
the other side I

768
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,220
think the result is a symmetric
matrix when I multiply.

769
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:33,090
So it's these symmetric
factorizations

770
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:36,170
that we're getting to and
are important problems

771
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:39,120
because our important
problems are symmetric.

772
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,830
Ok, why is that sure
to be symmetric?

773
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,940
Suppose I asked
you as a exercise,

774
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:51,730
prove that L times a diagonal
times L transpose is always

775
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,230
a symmetric matrix.

776
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:57,370
How could you do that?

777
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,480
How could you do that?

778
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,300
You could certainly create
an example that did it

779
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,530
and check it out,
multiply, it would work.

780
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:11,920
But we want to see that this
is going to be true always.

781
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,580
So how would you do that?

782
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,860
I guess, let me get started.

783
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,860
I would take its transpose.

784
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,330
If I want to show
something's symmetric,

785
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:28,880
I transpose it and see if I
get the same matrix again.

786
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,050
So let me take the
transpose of this.

787
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:35,040
So I'm answering, Why is
it sure to be symmetric?

788
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,550
So let me take K transpose.

789
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,080
So this is the
transpose of, I have

790
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,900
K equals something times
something times something,

791
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,510
A times B times
C, you could say.

792
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:53,600
If I transpose a
matrix, how can I

793
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:59,810
create transposes
out of A, B and C.

794
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,340
Do you remember what happens?

795
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,280
They reverse the order.

796
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,710
It's like inverses.

797
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:14,360
Transposes and inverses
both have that key rule.

798
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,810
When you have a product
and you invert it,

799
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,300
they come in the opposite order.

800
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,180
When you transpose it, they
come in the opposite order.

801
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:26,060
So let me try put these
separate transposes

802
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:31,380
in the opposite order.

803
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,410
So I've used the most
important fact there.

804
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:43,740
Which is just a fact about
transposing a product.

805
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,910
Okay, what have I got now?

806
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:50,700
What's L transpose transposed?

807
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,500
It's L, great.

808
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,290
What's L transpose L transposed?

809
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:57,680
Nothing but L. Transpose
twice and I'm back to L.

810
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,030
What about D transpose?

811
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:04,350
Same as D. Because D was
symmetric, in fact diagonal.

812
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:08,730
So what have I learned?

813
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,590
The proof is done.

814
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,080
I've got K back again.

815
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,830
This was the original K. So I've
learned that K transpose is K.

816
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:21,210
So you're going to
see time after time,

817
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:24,510
let me just put
these things there,

818
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:28,960
you're going to see an A
transpose times an A. That's

819
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,730
the most important, most highly
important multiplication.

820
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,110
Take a matrix,
maybe rectangular,

821
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,100
multiply by A transpose.

822
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:43,220
So this matrix is
certainly square

823
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,130
because A could be m by n.

824
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:51,010
And then A transpose
would be n by m

825
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:55,460
and the result would be n by n.

826
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,150
So it's certainly square.

827
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:00,500
But now what's the new
property we now know?

828
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,280
It's symmetric.

829
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,300
It's symmetric because
if I transpose it,

830
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,880
the transpose of A
will go on this side,

831
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,990
the double transpose
will go on this side,

832
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:16,960
but the double transpose
is A again, so symmetric.

833
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,090
So I'm plugging away here
on symmetric matrices

834
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:30,970
because they're just-- yeah,
what does symmetry mean in,

835
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:42,000
yeah, can I just come back
to this idea of responses?

836
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:50,090
And by the way, if
this was symmetric,

837
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,930
would its inverse be symmetric?

838
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:54,690
The answer is yes.

839
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:59,370
If a matrix is symmetric,
its inverse is symmetric.

840
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:04,960
These symmetric matrices
are a fantastic family.

841
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,700
So I could add that to this.

842
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:17,460
K inverse will also symmetric
without having yet said why.

843
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,810
But maybe in words, I'll
just say a few words here

844
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:27,260
at the end.

845
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:31,230
So what's a typical entry?

846
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:37,590
Say the (2, 1) entry, just to
carry on with this language one

847
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,310
more moment.

848
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:43,000
This is A inverse here.

849
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,510
Now the (2, 1)
entry in the inverse

850
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:53,280
is an impulse is in the first,
the first mass, whatever

851
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,650
gets an impulse.

852
00:52:56,650 --> 00:53:01,100
And that is the response
of the second mass.

853
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:06,440
The response in position two
to the impulse in position one.

854
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,660
Now my matrix is
symmetric, thinking

855
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,580
about symmetric matrices here.

856
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,680
So what about here?

857
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,730
Here, if I take the
impulse in position two

858
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,920
and look at the response
in position one,

859
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,670
so do you see the difference?

860
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,800
In general, those
could be different.

861
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:30,000
This is the response at position
two to an impulse at one.

862
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,870
This is the response at
one to an impulse at two.

863
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:37,330
You see that I'm
multiplying those columns

864
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:38,690
and getting these columns.

865
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:42,200
And what's the point
about symmetry?

866
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,590
Those are the same.

867
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:48,420
Symmetry is expressing
this physical meaning

868
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:53,180
that the response at
i, to an impulse at j

869
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:58,390
is the same as the response
at j to an impulse at i.

870
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:03,970
And that's sort of, that's
such an important property,

871
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:06,530
you want to notice it.

872
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:09,910
And it goes into symmetry.

873
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:14,910
So many, many problems will be
symmetric and then some won't.

874
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:17,870
We'll have to admit this
won't cover everything,

875
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:22,150
but it covers such an
important and beautiful part.

876
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:29,290
So that's today's lecture
on LU elimination,

877
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:34,160
solving linear
systems, and then let's

878
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:40,100
move forward to understanding
the actual inverses.
