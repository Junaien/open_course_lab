10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,210
PROFESSOR STRANG: So I'm
ready for anything, hope I am.

11
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,030
Questions about any topic.

12
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:27,530
Yes.

13
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,816
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

14
00:00:28,816 --> 00:00:31,190
PROFESSOR STRANG: I feel this
is like a White House press

15
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:31,730
conference.

16
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,760
I think there's always
somebody in the front row who

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,610
gets to ask the first
question, and then

18
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,350
gets to say thank you
Mr. President at the end,

19
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:47,450
and then I'm off.

20
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,800
Yes.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,100
I'm tempted by the
way to ask you all,

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,060
are you going to
vote next Tuesday

23
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,780
and of course I'd like
to know who you vote for,

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,130
and I'd like to
give you my advice.

25
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,050
But I don't know
that that's proper.

26
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,510
If anybody wants
advice, they can email.

27
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,460
But please vote.

28
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,320
Please vote.

29
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,380
Yeah.

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,900
Alright, question here and
then we'll have, well, yeah.

31
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,660
PROFESSOR STRANG: Oh, OK,
so those were just posted.

33
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,930
Like, I see.

34
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,400
3.3 number two.

35
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

36
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:40,130
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, so this
was a case -- yeah, right.

37
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,640
Oh, OK.

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:50,690
We could be wrong so
this is 3.3 number two,

39
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:55,970
asks you about the flow field.

40
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,540
Which has no flow
in the x direction,

41
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,530
the velocity in the
x direction is zero.

42
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,660
The velocity in the
y direction is x.

43
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,210
OK, so suppose we just
take that as a full field

44
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,820
and try to understand,
is it a gradient?

45
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,260
I mean, so what are the
questions I would ask?

46
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,940
Is it a gradient of anything?

47
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,290
Because we're now thinking v and
w are pretty much the same guy.

48
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,060
So is it a gradient, yes or no?

49
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,110
If so, what's the potential?

50
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,160
Is it divergence-free,
yes or no?

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,810
If it is, what's
the stream function?

52
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:40,510
And of course if the answer
to both tests was yes, then

53
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,110
we would be talking
about Laplace's equation.

54
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,600
I suspect for this
example the answer,

55
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,480
at least to one of the
two questions, will be no.

56
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,160
So we won't have the two pieces
coming together into Laplace.

57
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,820
OK, so first of all.

58
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,860
Is it a gradient?

59
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:08,300
What's the test for, so
my two questions are,

60
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,160
is v the gradient of some u?

61
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,560
And what's the test for that?

62
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,930
You remember if it
is a gradient --

63
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,860
and see if I can
remember myself.

64
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:28,130
If it is a gradient, then this
is du/dx, and this is du/dy,

65
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:33,050
and the condition that v_1
and v_2 would have to satisfy

66
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,090
is that the y
derivative of that would

67
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,820
have to equal the x
derivative of that,

68
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,840
because on the right-hand
side they are the same.

69
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,550
u_xy is the same as u_yx.

70
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:53,300
So I would look at -- so
let me write that again.

71
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:04,620
I need dv_1/dy to equal dv_2/dx,
and is that true in this

72
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,690
example?

73
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,780
What's dv_1/dy?

74
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,546
Zero.

75
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:11,170
What's dv_2/dx?

76
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,610


77
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,600
One.

78
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,960
So the answer's no.

79
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,360
OK.

80
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,870
So, test failed.

81
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:29,480
Alright, the second question
is does it possibly sit over

82
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,680
in the divergence-free world?

83
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,310
Is the divergence of, now
I'll call it w. equal zero?

84
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,420
So the answer was
no to that question

85
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,720
but now I think the answer
to this question will be yes.

86
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,550
Because what's the
divergence of this thing?

87
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,020
It's the x derivative of
that, which is certainly

88
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,780
zero, plus the y derivative of
that, which is certainly zero.

89
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,260
So the answer is yes.

90
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:04,290
So there's no potential but
there is a stream function,

91
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:04,980
right?

92
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,200
Because the stream function
comes in with this test.

93
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,390
So let's remember what, just
from today's lecture, what

94
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,980
was the stream function?

95
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:26,550
From dw_1/dx+dw_2/dy=0, that'll
be satisfied if w_1 is the y

96
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,160
derivative of the
stream function,

97
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,220
and w_2 is minus
the x derivative.

98
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:38,730
Because then this matches
the x derivative of this

99
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,980
plus the y derivative of
this, which is the divergence;

100
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,980
on the right-hand
side I would get zero.

101
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,040
So there's got to be
an s, and what is it?

102
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,150
Probably not hard to find.

103
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,930
Let's see.

104
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,540
Here w_1 is zero,
so that tells me

105
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,600
s doesn't depend
on y at all. w_2

106
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,860
is x, so x is supposed to
be minus the x derivative

107
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,930
of the stream function, so what
is the stream function now?

108
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,330
Have I got room to put it here?

109
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,820
Just about.

110
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,440
What will work?

111
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,060
So again, here's w_1.

112
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,420
The y derivative of s
is zero. w_2 tells me

113
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,710
that the x derivative
of s is minus x.

114
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,660
So all I'm looking for is a
function that only depends

115
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,520
on x, has no dependence
on y, and its derivative

116
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,530
should be minus x.

117
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,260
So what's the function?

118
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,070
Minus a half of x squared.

119
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:54,430
Yeah, so this gives me s equal
minus a half of x squared.

120
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,830
Alright, so you're
saying that, so there

121
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,560
is a stream function, right.

122
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,780
And what does that travel along?

123
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,110
That travels along steam, that
means that the flow buzzes

124
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,800
along streamlines.

125
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,650
And what are the streamlines?

126
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,220
They're the lines
where s is constant.

127
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,100
Equipotentials were the
lines where u is constant,

128
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,050
but here we don't have
a u in this problem.

129
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,300
Streamlines are lines
where the s is constant,

130
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,030
so minus 1/2 x
squared is constant,

131
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,270
what's the picture look like?

132
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,910
Picture then, for
that, well, and you

133
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:42,600
know what the flow is doing
at a typical point here.

134
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,390
Say x=3, y=1.

135
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,630
Let me draw the little arrow.

136
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:55,150
With a big chalk Which
way is the flow going?

137
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:01,940
Well, the x component is
zero, the y component is x.

138
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,730
So the flow is going
up there, right?

139
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:10,270
Here the y component's x.

140
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:16,330
This whole line is all traveling
up with the same velocity.

141
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,770
If I drop a leaf there, it
buzzes up that straight line.

142
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,570
So that's the streamline.

143
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:27,940
And its velocity is,
that's x equal -- if, say,

144
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,590
the velocity is three
then this speed is three.

145
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,440
It's going up that line.

146
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,160
So that's a streamline.

147
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,780
And sure enough, on that
line minus 1/2 x squared

148
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,950
is a constant.

149
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,850
So you see we're not
talking parabolas

150
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,200
here because our curve is not
y equals minus 1/2 x squared,

151
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,140
it's minus 1/2 x
squared equal constant.

152
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,330
Yeah, that's what we want.

153
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:02,630
So, but now having got so
far, let me take x=1, say.

154
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,650
What's the flow like on that?

155
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:11,340
So there's a streamline
with s equal constant.

156
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,070
And the velocity
on that is zero,

157
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,750
so nothing is going in
that -- horizontally.

158
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:25,120
And now it's one, so the
flow is slower up this line.

159
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,640
OK, slower flow.

160
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,140
This was faster flow.

161
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,610
And then the question that's
in that homework problem is,

162
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,570
is there any rotation
in this flow?

163
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:45,300
We think about rotation, we have
an image of rotational flow.

164
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,370
And that could be the next
example, we could figure out.

165
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,660
A flow that goes around
in circles, right?

166
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,440
Those would be the streamlines.

167
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:03,830
So this would be like pure
rotation, shall I call it.

168
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,330
But I don't have that there.

169
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,580
I just want to draw the
other picture, in which

170
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:16,410
the streamlines are circles.

171
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,790
To have another nice,
clean, beautiful example.

172
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,910
OK, but here we don't have.

173
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,070
Our streamlines
are straight lines,

174
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,910
and yet we have rotation.

175
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,490
That's the point here.

176
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,180
Why do I say we have rotation?

177
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,530
Because the test for rotation
was that original test

178
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:43,710
of looking at, which I just
wrote the answer to be no here.

179
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,120
So if it's not a
gradient, the reason

180
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,530
is there's some rotation.

181
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,230
Gradient fields don't
have any rotation.

182
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:59,680
The rotation is this
thing that comes out,

183
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,000
yeah it's this
difference. dv_2/dx,

184
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,720
it's the difference
between those that tells us

185
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,190
the rotation.

186
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,260
And that was not zero, right?

187
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:18,600
For this example dv_1/dy was
zero, because v_1 is zero.

188
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,670
dv_2/dx was one,
because v_2 is x.

189
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,590
So there's some rotation here.

190
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:30,100
And in other words the
test for being a gradient

191
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,800
is no rotation.

192
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,720
This fails that test.

193
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,260
But how is it rotating?

194
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:41,000
How can it be rotating when
the all the flow is just

195
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,530
traveling vertically?

196
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:48,150
I guess I give you this example
because it meant something

197
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,820
to me.

198
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,350
My image of rotation was this
simpleminded type of flow.

199
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,940
You know, like a phonograph
record or something.

200
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,160
This would be
called a sheer flow.

201
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,950
A very important type of flow.

202
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,540
And actually, you'll realize
that if x is negative

203
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,480
then the flow in the second
component, the velocity,

204
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,470
is now negative.

205
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,300
So it would be the
streamline, the flow

206
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,820
would be going down this way.

207
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,420
And this point
wouldn't move at all.

208
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,670
This would be, well I don't
know if it's a streamline,

209
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:30,200
it's a stagnant
streamline, right? x=0.

210
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,510
On that line, there's
no velocity. [0, 0].

211
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,000
So this is all
just staying there.

212
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
These lines are moving,
this line moving faster,

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,950
this line would be
moving even faster.

214
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,920
This line's going the other way.

215
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,650
Faster and faster the other way.

216
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,190
It's a important flow.

217
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,650
You know, in earthquakes
and things like that.

218
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:57,920
This happens, when one plate
shears with respect to another.

219
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,210
So that's shearing.

220
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:05,940
The word shearing means
that a line that was --

221
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,810
that line after a
while is tilted.

222
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,050
This is going faster than this.

223
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,710
Yes.

224
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

225
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,530
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Right, being a constant.

226
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
That's true.

227
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,370
Ah, well, OK.

228
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,290
Let's see.

229
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,590
Well, how do I fix that?

230
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:39,770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

231
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,810
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes.

232
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,870
That's a good question.

233
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:48,680
Should I have allowed
in my stream function,

234
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,320
I mean that's a stream function.

235
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,730
Because it satisfies the
equations that stream functions

236
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,580
are -- I could have thrown
in a constant, yeah.

237
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,910
So your pointing
out a difficulty

238
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,880
makes me think I should
have thrown in a constant.

239
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,510
So if I throw in constants then
I could get other lines, yeah.

240
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,630
Thanks, that's a good point.

241
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,600
I just want to see, do you
see rotation in this flow,

242
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,380
in this shear flow?

243
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,600
And I think you do.

244
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,840
If you think about it.

245
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,680
Suppose you put a little leaf,
or a little penny or something

246
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,920
right there.

247
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,150
OK, is it going to turn?

248
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,880
It'll flow along, but as it
flows, is it going to turn?

249
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:40,410
In other words, is there some
difference in the speed on one

250
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,550
side compared to the other?

251
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,280
I mean, it's what makes
a curveball curve, right?

252
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,140
When the pitcher throws the
ball, he imparts a spin to it,

253
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,090
and that gives a
different pressure

254
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,630
on the two sides of the
ball, and the ball moves.

255
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,330
I think that's going
to happen here.

256
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,540
Maybe you see it,
and I'm just talking.

257
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,220
I mean, this side is going
faster than this side.

258
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:11,180
So the net result is that even
though the thing is traveling

259
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,440
up and down, it's turning.

260
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,550
It's turning because the
right-hand side is going faster

261
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,910
than the left-hand side.

262
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,750
So it does have a rotation.

263
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,290
This quantity, this difference
between dv_1/dy and dv_2/dx,

264
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,510
which is the
component of the curl,

265
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,700
maybe the sign should
be the opposite,

266
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,650
maybe I think it should be minus
this plus this or something.

267
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,990
Point is that it's not zero.

268
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,800
So there is curl,
there is rotation.

269
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,830
OK.

270
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,600
I was going to ask
about this picture, too.

271
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,870
And then I'll open
to more examples.

272
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,600
I just feel examples are good.

273
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,430
Simple velocity fields, like 0x.

274
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,040


275
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,440
Just to think through,
OK, what does that mean?

276
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,310
Is it curl free?

277
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,650
Another way of saying is it a
gradient field would be to say

278
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,900
is it curl free?

279
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,260
Irrotational is the
right word here.

280
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,960
Test one, is it
irrotational, answer no.

281
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,320
Is it divergence-free,
is it source-free,

282
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,690
the answer was yes,
for this example.

283
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,830
If we pick another example
I could reverse those,

284
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,810
or another example -- I
can probably come up with

285
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,590
an example here.

286
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:39,160
Let's see, what if I wanted
the streamlines to be circles,

287
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:46,110
what would be a good velocity
field that goes in circles?

288
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,020
Let's see.

289
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,120
At a typical point, if I want
the velocity to be going that

290
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,030
way, here's the vector,
the position vector,

291
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,260
the radial vector that goes
-- so what are the components

292
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,880
of this vector?

293
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,890
Just [x, y].

294
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:12,300
So now if I want the velocity
field to go other way,

295
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:18,560
what would be a good
thing with rotation?

296
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,640
[-y, x] would sound good.

297
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,460
v=[-y, x].

298
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,440


299
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,390
So are we expecting this to
be a gradient of anything?

300
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,730
I'm not.

301
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,380
We've built in rotation here.

302
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,940
I'm expecting the curl of
this thing, this quantity,

303
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,720
I think I take the
x derivative --

304
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,805
I look at the y derivative of
this and compare it with the x

305
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:49,910
derivative of that.

306
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,450
And they're not the same;
in fact one is minus one

307
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,070
and the other's plus one.

308
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,420
So I've got rotation here.

309
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:03,340
I've got sort of two, is
the component of the curl.

310
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:09,180
So let's just write
it down. dv_2/dx,

311
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:16,210
this vorticity that measures
the turning speed is one from

312
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,620
dv_2/dx, minus one is two.

313
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,940
So it's not a
gradient of anything.

314
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,180
If the x derivative
of u is minus y,

315
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,890
then the y derivative
can't be plus x, no good.

316
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,580
OK, what about, is
it divergence-free?

317
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,330


318
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,350
Do I need a source to
keep this flow going?

319
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,700
Well, what's the test?

320
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,650
In other words, is there a
stream function for this guy?

321
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,320
I think probably there is.

322
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,900
What's the test to know if
there is a stream function?

323
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,100
I take the divergence, I'm
over on the right-hand side

324
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,260
of my picture now.

325
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,170
I take the divergence.

326
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:07,130
Divergence of this v is
the x derivative of that

327
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,280
plus the y derivative
of that, good, zero.

328
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,440
So there is a stream function.

329
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,620
And what is it?

330
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,740
Well, I'm pretty sure that
these streamlines are circles,

331
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,525
I think the stream
function is going

332
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:27,670
to be x squared plus y squared.

333
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,920
Yep.

334
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:38,420
Then, am I right that the y
derivative of that will be 2y.

335
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,990
That's not looking too good.

336
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,590
What do I want here?

337
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,520
Here's my v, which
is the same as w.

338
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,630
And what I'm looking for is
to get these guys correct.

339
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,330
So -- and I should
be able to do it.

340
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,230
And what would s be?

341
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,410
I haven't got s quite right.

342
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,760
I think if I multiply
by negative 1/2,

343
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,490
that might have done it.

344
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:13,860
Yeah, because now the y
derivative is now minus y.

345
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,050
Great.

346
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:20,410
And the x derivative
of s is minus x,

347
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,800
and then I should take
a minus that, so I

348
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,890
should want a plus x,
which is what I've got.

349
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,950
So those are the streamlines.

350
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,380
Circles.

351
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,530
So I have circle, the flow
is going around in a circle.

352
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:40,550
I don't have to -- I don't need
any source to keep it going.

353
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:48,400
But it's not a gradient.

354
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:57,760
So this is like a sample test,
to take a simple flow field,

355
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,340
apply the two tests,
and I guess we

356
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,310
should complete with an
example that passes both tests.

357
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,500
Right?

358
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,740
Let me open to any
other question,

359
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,460
and then we could cook
up an example that passes

360
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,380
both tests before we stop.

361
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,850
I'll stop talking first, though.

362
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:23,360
Just listen for a
question on any topic.

363
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,100
Or is it useful just to
take fields like this

364
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,620
and go through those steps?

365
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,610
It probably is.

366
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,020
It's certainly good for me.

367
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,290
OK, what's a field that
will satisfy everybody,

368
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:40,710
that will be a
gradient field and also

369
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:45,030
divergence-free, so that
we'll have solutions

370
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,460
to Laplace's equation.

371
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,610
Let's see.

372
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:59,040
Well we had some solutions
to Laplace's equation there.

373
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,880
You know if I make it
linear it's real easy.

374
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:11,450
If I make it quadratic -- huh.

375
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,740
Can I anticipate a little
what's coming Friday?

376
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,720
I so recommend to come to
Friday's lecture, but --

377
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,750
so what's coming?

378
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,310
What did we do today?

379
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:27,760
We discovered that we got
solutions to Laplace's equation

380
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,440
from all, by real and imaginary
parts of all these guys.

381
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,510
Those were terrific.

382
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:38,180
And then we could take
combinations of those.

383
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,610
So here's what's coming Friday.

384
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:46,800
When I take combinations of
these guys I get some function

385
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:54,030
of this magic complex -- of
this magic combination x+iy.

386
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,940
Some function, any function.

387
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,850
Any reasonable function, and
we'll say what reasonable

388
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,820
means, of x+iy, its real part
and its imaginary part are

389
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,330
going to be great.

390
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,460
This is like the center of a
big, big part of mathematics.

391
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,660
Functions of x+iy.

392
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,560


393
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:20,030
And by nice I mean that
these series converge.

394
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,240
So that we have really
a nice function.

395
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,780
Let me take the first function
that comes to mind. e^(x+iy).

396
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,510


397
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,850
So let me take this
to be e^(x+iy).

398
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,690


399
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,571
OK.

400
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:38,070
Right.

401
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,590
So you remember, I'm
aiming to get solutions

402
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,930
to Laplace's equation, because
that will give me automatically

403
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,220
the two pieces both working.

404
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,870
So I claim that the real part
of that, and the imaginary part,

405
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,860
those are my twins, u
and s, both solve --

406
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,200
so u is going to be the
real part of this function.

407
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,740
And s is going to be the
imaginary part of it.

408
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,360
And I claim that those will
both solve Laplace's equation.

409
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,150
We can plug it in
and see that it does.

410
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,320
And that they will
have, they're twinned

411
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,820
by the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

412
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,950
So how am I going
to simplify that,

413
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,710
so that I can identify what's
the real part of that thing

414
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,170
and what's the imaginary part?

415
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,950
This is actually,
that's a good question.

416
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:36,960
I don't know how much you've
run into i, in the past.

417
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,350
Are you happy with
something like that?

418
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,360
How could you find
the real part of it,

419
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,540
how could you simplify it?

420
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:51,820
How else could I write
e to the something?

421
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,830
Exactly.

422
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,880
Think of it as the
product of two,

423
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,790
so the key fact about
exponentials is that

424
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,650
that's the same as
e^x times e^(iy).

425
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,680


426
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,260
The exponents add, so that's
the first thing always

427
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,280
to think about as a possibility.

428
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,950
Now, what am I going to do?

429
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,770
I still want to get a real part.

430
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:18,330
This is clearly all
real, right? e^x is real.

431
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,960
So it's this part that's going
to give me the two pieces.

432
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,310
So this is going to
be e^x times -- now,

433
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,850
what do I put for e^(iy)?

434
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,820
cos(y), good.

435
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,820
Plus i*sin(y), good.

436
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,090
And now I can read
off, no problem.

437
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:43,990
What is this real part that I
was looking for? e^x*cos(y).

438
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:48,380


439
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,787
And the imaginary part is
just what's multiplying the i,

440
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:53,620
it's the e^x*sin(y).

441
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,840


442
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,080
OK, so what's my claim?

443
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,990
I claim that that function
solves Laplace's equation.

444
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,330
And this one too.

445
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,310
And that they're twinned.

446
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,890
And that they give
streamlines and equipotentials

447
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:22,670
that meet at right
angles, it's another pair.

448
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,290
Plug that into
Laplace's equation.

449
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:33,835
So let me do u_xx+u_yy, just
to satisfy that it is going

450
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:35,710
to come out zero.

451
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:39,380
So what's the xx derivative,
the second x derivative

452
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,880
of that function?

453
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,620
Take its derivative with respect
to x, and then do it again,

454
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,480
and what do you have?

455
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,010
Same.

456
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:55,330
Didn't change. e^x is just --
and now what about the second y

457
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,060
derivative?

458
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,350
So now e^x is just a constant.

459
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,330
What's the second
derivative of cos(y)?

460
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,880


461
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,080
Negative cos(y).

462
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,580
Right.

463
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,870
Because the first
derivative is negative sine,

464
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,160
the second derivative
is negative cosine.

465
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,300
So the second derivative
is e^x, it didn't change,

466
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,440
times cos(y) with a minus sine.

467
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,390
And you see what --
did I write sine?

468
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,710
I meant to write cosine.

469
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,430
Cancel that from the tape.

470
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,171
OK, right.

471
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:29,670
Yeah.

472
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:33,065
So the second x derivative
was just e^x, e^x,

473
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,900
cos(y) didn't move.

474
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,770
Sorry.

475
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,100
That was frightening.

476
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,850
OK, and then now here's
the second y derivative.

477
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,630
In other words, it gives zero.

478
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,760
Gives zero, and
this one would too.

479
00:27:48,760 --> 00:28:01,380
Now, I don't really have an idea
of what the picture is like.

480
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,890
But it's important.

481
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,780
We've got a flow field here,
and it's from e^z, e^(x+iy).

482
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,010
Exponential has gotta be
an important function.

483
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,040
So it's got to be
somehow interesting.

484
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,140
What do you think --
so what would the --

485
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,610
what would the equipotential
lines looks like?

486
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,760
Oh, boy.

487
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,210
e^x*cos(y) equal a constant.

488
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,740
My gosh.

489
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,350
e^x*cos(y).

490
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,240
So let's see.

491
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,610
I don't know how to draw this
picture, but one thing I know

492
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:48,840
is that if I changed y by
2pi, I would get another copy

493
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,650
of this curve, right?

494
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,060
If I changed y by -- every
time you see cosine or sine,

495
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,990
you think hey, that's periodic.

496
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,730
If I change it by 2pi.

497
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:10,510
So I'm thinking that y between
zero and 2 pi, so here's y=0.

498
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:18,390
And y=2pi, I'm thinking that
my flow probably somehow stays

499
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,850
in a strip.

500
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,970
Like that.

501
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,780
And then the whole thing
just repeats, and repeats,

502
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,430
and repeats.

503
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:31,260
So I'm thinking, really this
is flow in an infinite strip.

504
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,510
Infinite pipe or
something like that.

505
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:38,160
You can imagine that there
could be applications.

506
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,040
But I still haven't
drawn the curve.

507
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:46,080
I just think, let's see, what
would it look like when y is

508
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,300
a little -- suppose I'm
trying to draw the picture

509
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:55,380
of e^x*cos(y)=1, whatever.

510
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,970
OK, I'll just attempt
to draw that curve.

511
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:09,180
Just, so if y was a
little bit off of zero,

512
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,460
the cosine would be, yeah,
how's it going to go?

513
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:24,980
If y is just a little
off zero, tell me

514
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:30,080
any points on this curve?

515
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,560
I can see that e^x is
going to be a big number.

516
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,400
Is (0,0) on the curve?

517
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,140
Good.

518
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,310
Got one point.

519
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,320
Alright.

520
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,120
Now, suppose y is a
little bit more than zero.

521
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,190
So suppose y goes
up a little bit.

522
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:59,920
Then what? (1,0) or something?

523
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,420
Yeah.

524
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,530
I suppose (1,0)?

525
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,410
No, no.

526
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:16,790
So if y goes up a little, then
x would go out a little bit.

527
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,080
So what's happening?

528
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:26,800
So cos(y), so the cos(y) is
going to drop from one to zero,

529
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,680
right?

530
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,020
To start with.

531
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,360
Then, if this cos(y) is dropping
from one to zero then this e^x

532
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,650
has got to climb up, to
to keep the product one.

533
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,530
So I'll move out.

534
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,390
So somehow it'll move out.

535
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:59,230
I think maybe when
y reaches pi/2,

536
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:06,100
then the cosine has
got down to zero.

537
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,270
We could work on
this for a while.

538
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,440
Or we could let MATLAB draw it.

539
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,590
But I think that we would see
these -- and I could do better.

540
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,900
I'm feeling pretty humiliated to
not have a better picture here.

541
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,190
Suppose y is a little
less than zero,

542
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,990
do we get anything
interesting there?

543
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,610
Oh well, the cosine
is an even function.

544
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,740
So I think the thing
might, is it just

545
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,600
going to turn around like that?

546
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,450
So that y and minus
y -- for a certain x,

547
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,299
the y value and the minus
y will both be on the curve

548
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,590
because the cosine doesn't
know whether it's the cosine

549
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,170
of of a plus or a minus.

550
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:58,250
Yeah, I think we would
get curves of that sort.

551
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:04,210
And then the other
curves, s equal constant,

552
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:08,530
the streamlines will
somehow go vertically.

553
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:14,090
Maybe I'll just not
use the whole time

554
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:18,300
to work on that
particular curve.

555
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,220
We'd have to prepare it.

556
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,690
The point is, you see how
incredibly easily we produce

557
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,450
solutions to Laplace's
equation that you

558
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:31,190
wouldn't have thought of, and
I wouldn't have thought of.

559
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,340
So that would be one way
to produce solutions.

560
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:39,410
I might even repeat this one in
class Friday, or I might not.

561
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:43,090
Let me suggest another
couple of possibilities

562
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,690
that I will do in class.

563
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,930
Can I just give you a
couple of other functions f.

564
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:54,220
In fact, I'll just erase that
one and put in some other ones.

565
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,980
Suppose I took the
function 1/(x+iy).

566
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:07,370


567
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:11,080
So that's a function of this
magic combination, x+iy.

568
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,460
What's its real part and
what's its imaginary part?

569
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,470
Do you know how to split that
guy into real and imaginary?

570
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,380
There's a little
trick, if you remember

571
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,660
from learning complex numbers.

572
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,500
Do you remember the trick?

573
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:32,130
The problem is that this thing
is down in the denominator,

574
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,070
right?

575
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,610
We don't want it there.

576
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,570
Because we can't split the real
and imaginary parts down there.

577
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,560
So I would like to
rewrite it in a way that

578
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,690
gets something real
down in the denominator,

579
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,340
moves all the i stuff
up in the numerator

580
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,290
where I can separate it.

581
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,830
How do I do it?

582
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:59,540
Multiply both sides by, both
top and bottom, by x-iy.

583
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,310
Good.

584
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,320
So what does that
put down here now?

585
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,140
That's a number
times its conjugate

586
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,550
and that's going to
produce x squared.

587
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,620
Minus or plus?

588
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,450
Plus y squared, right.

589
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,860
The number times its conjugate
is the length squared.

590
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:27,090
And now we just have x-iy, and
now it's obvious what the u is.

591
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,490
This is real now,
so the u is just

592
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:35,550
x over x squared plus
y squared, and the s

593
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:41,930
is the minus y over x
squared plus y squared.

594
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,760
That's a very interesting flow.

595
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,070
That's an interesting
flow, and we

596
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,800
could do its picture and so on.

597
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,980
And in fact it would
be a nicer picture

598
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:57,400
than the one we stopped on.

599
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:03,170
What should I notice
about this flow?

600
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:08,760
Of course, the flow is
automatically irrotational;

601
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,860
the curl is zero because
there is a potential.

602
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,560
A gradient of a potential,
the gradient of a potential

603
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,710
is going to be free of rotation.

604
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:30,550
And there will be streamlines,
all those good things.

605
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:34,090
There's one bad point
about the flow, though.

606
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:36,180
Which is where?

607
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,450
At (0,0).

608
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:42,690
The whole thing falls apart,
at the origin this falls apart.

609
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:46,240
So this is a great flow
except at the origin,

610
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,420
it's very problematic.

611
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,080
It's singular at the origin.

612
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:56,370
So if we drew the pictures we
would see something strange.

613
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:59,530
This is going to
zero at the origin.

614
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,800
So, yeah, we have trouble at
the origin but an important flow

615
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,450
otherwise, yep.

616
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,170
And I'll just mention
the third but I

617
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,590
won't do anything with it.

618
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:12,720
Because it's such
a neat one that I

619
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,540
have to save it for Friday.

620
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,500
The other natural function
to think of is the logarithm.

621
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,890
The logarithm of x+iy.

622
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:28,870
Split that into u and s.

623
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,320
What kind of a thing
do we have here?

624
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,760
What kind of singularity?

625
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,080
Yeah, let me just do two
moments on this example,

626
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,560
and then leave it for Friday
because the whole class has

627
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,090
to see it.

628
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,530
Is there a singularity
for this guy?

629
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:56,300
Is there a point (x,y) where
the logarithm is not great?

630
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,460
At the origin, again.

631
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,660
We'll again have a
singularity at the origin.

632
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,260
Something strange is
happening at the origin.

633
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,730
And what we'll find is there's
a delta function there.

634
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:14,220
We're feeding in, we have a
source right at the origin

635
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:20,410
and then it's flowing out
on, I think on radial lines.

636
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:23,600
I think the streamlines
go out from the origin

637
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,180
and the equipotentials
go around the origin.

638
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,220
Yeah, it's a great example.

639
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,200
So that's another one to come.

640
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,290
OK, so examples
like these are --

641
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:41,820
I mean generations of
thinking went into solutions

642
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,380
of Laplace's equation.

643
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:50,550
And 2-D particularly where we
have this special combination.

644
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:55,210
I wish we had such a combination
in 3-D but we simply don't.

645
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,780
We can discuss Laplace's
equation in 3-D of course,

646
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,590
very important.

647
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,980
But I mean, wave equation, this
fact that we're talking to each

648
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:16,520
other, is got the Laplacian in
3-D, but there's no x+iy magic.

649
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,170
OK, that's some u's and
s's and v's and w's.

650
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:25,880
What else is on your mind?

651
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,420
Questions?

652
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,200
I could ask this question,
oh, here's something

653
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,910
I did not do in class.

654
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,070
I think I wrote down
the divergence theorem.

655
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,380
So can we start by doing that?

656
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:47,350
Let me write down the divergence
theorem, with your help.

657
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:55,270
And then use it.

658
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,280
So what does the divergence
theorem -- we're in 2-D.

659
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,230
So this is 2-D, just
the similar theorem.

660
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:08,950
So what does the theorem say,
that if I take the divergence

661
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:19,710
of some w, some vector field,
then if I integrate that over

662
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:24,370
some region -- so I have some
region here and at every point

663
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,950
there's a flow w.

664
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:33,700
And I look at the divergence of
w and I integrate that, dx dy,

665
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,500
so that's a double
integral over a region,

666
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:44,950
I will get, what's
the right-hand side?

667
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:48,040
What does the
divergence measure?

668
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:53,380
So I'm really asking like just
memory, what is the divergence,

669
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,740
it's an identity.

670
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:00,990
It's integration by parts
in some way, as we'll see.

671
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:06,470
But what do you remember
for the divergence theorem?

672
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:09,070
You get what?

673
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:14,020
It measures how much
flux out, right?

674
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,750
So when we measure the
flux out by integrating

675
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:21,700
around the boundary, how much
is getting through the boundary?

676
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,870
And what's the flow
through the boundary?

677
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,430
I take w, but that's a vector.

678
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:32,340
And I'm looking for
what component of w?

679
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,230
The normal component, the
component of w, w dot n,

680
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:42,040
the component of w that's
headed out. n is defined to be,

681
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,100
whatever the boundary is -- here
I've made it look like a circle

682
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,650
but I shouldn't have.

683
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,730
Let me make it a little
wobblier or something.

684
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:57,990
So the normal component at
any, there, look at that point.

685
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:01,630
The normal direction
through the boundary,

686
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,390
down in that crazy
point, is this way.

687
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,090
So the normal is
going this way here.

688
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,100
Here, it's going over this way.

689
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,680
It's perpendicular
to the boundary, OK?

690
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,160
And then we integrate
around the boundary.

691
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,880
Alright.

692
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,440
So that's the identity of that,
that's the divergence theorem.

693
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,280
Now, let's see.

694
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,510
Could you, yeah.

695
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:38,260
So we have a minute.

696
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,990
You want to take a
particular w and see

697
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:45,770
if this would be correct?

698
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:50,710
How about w=w=[0, x],
our first example?

699
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,830
Suppose I tried w=[0, x].

700
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,640
I just want to see
if the divergence --

701
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,980
what the flux is
through the boundary.

702
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,130
What what region shall
I take for the --

703
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,470
so the divergence
theorem has two inputs.

704
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,320
It has a flow field.

705
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,580
And let me take w to be
[0, x], just so it's a shear.

706
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,260
And a region.

707
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,650
And of course the integral might
not be that much fun to do,

708
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:21,010
unless we make the region nice.

709
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:29,900
What do you take as a nice
region for -- actually,

710
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,320
it doesn't matter
what the region is.

711
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,510
Take any old region.

712
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,580
For the moment.

713
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,570
What's the answer?

714
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:41,040
For this particular
flow, w=w=[0, x]?

715
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,870


716
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,550
Zero.

717
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,570
That's the cool part.

718
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:54,500
If the answer's zero
then work is suspended.

719
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,840
And why is it zero?

720
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,620
Because the divergence
of this particular w,

721
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,550
the x derivative of that plus
the y derivative of that,

722
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,050
is zero.

723
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,800
This has divergence
everywhere zero.

724
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,740
So integrating is
no problem at all,

725
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:15,000
so that would be zero,
for this flow field.

726
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,290
For this divergence-free field.

727
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:24,610
Zero for that because
div w is zero.

728
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,290
But is that correct?

729
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:29,880
What does that tell
me, these flows are --

730
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,870
we saw what the flow is like.

731
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,990
Say there's the origin.

732
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:40,230
It doesn't have to be a
circle, it looks like a circle.

733
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,700
Do you see why the flux is zero?

734
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,540
There is flow through
the boundary, right?

735
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:52,130
Flow is going buzz, buzz,
buzz up this line and out.

736
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,920
And it's coming in here.

737
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,740
So there that's
what we discovered.

738
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:04,080
This [0, x] is vertical flow.

739
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,750
It hasn't gotten any
horizontal component.

740
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,320
It's got a vertical
component, it's going out.

741
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,940
And would we want to do
this right-hand side?

742
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,670
I don't think so, right.

743
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,370
This right-hand
side is asking me

744
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:21,960
what, I have to find the normal
direction on this, whatever

745
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,650
curve that is.

746
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:28,020
I have to take its dot
product with the flow [0, x],

747
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:33,180
so this is some quantity.

748
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,400
And then I have to do this ds
which I haven't even mentioned,

749
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,350
ds is arc length around.

750
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,680
I'm integrating
around these pieces.

751
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:48,690
But yet somehow we have
some idea from that picture

752
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:52,670
that the total flux is zero.

753
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:57,210
How would you say it in words,
if I say here's the flow field.

754
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:01,690
There's a region, funny shape.

755
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,880
The flux is zero
through that boundary.

756
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,700
And if I asked you why,
what would you say?

757
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,690
I mean, a math answer would
be use the divergence theorem.

758
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:19,300
But why from this picture does
it look like we have zero flux?

759
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,200
What comes in goes out, yeah.

760
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,840
What's coming in the bottom
here is going out the top.

761
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,620
That's basically it.

762
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,620
So we would get
zero for that one.

763
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,260
So I think the homework,
the suggested homework

764
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:42,430
maybe includes an example where
the divergence isn't zero.

765
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,910
And then you actually have
to do these integrals.

766
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:50,450
Just as practice for what
do those integrals mean.

767
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:55,690
Maybe I won't go through one
now, but that's good practice.

768
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:03,860
Take some simple w, but one
with a non-zero divergence

769
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,770
and then see if you
can do either or both

770
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:11,500
of the integrals that are
supposed to come out equal.

771
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,970
That's a good one Now,
there's one thing I could --

772
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:18,990
any questions, or discussion?

773
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:25,090
You guys are seeing
these examples come up;

774
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,080
it's the only way I would know
to learn this subject is take

775
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,210
simple v's and w's.

776
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:36,140
And see what you
can do with them.

777
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,800
We've got the
general principles,

778
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,300
but then apply them
to specific flows.

779
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes, thanks

780
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:51,729
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

781
00:47:51,729 --> 00:47:53,020
PROFESSOR STRANG: This theorem?

782
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:58,356
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

783
00:47:58,356 --> 00:47:59,730
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Yeah if it was,

784
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,350
well let's draw a funny shape.

785
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,680
See what we think.

786
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:11,470
I mean, with this flow, right?

787
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:16,510
Let me just say, if the flow
has some difficult divergence

788
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,550
and the region is
some mess, nobody's

789
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:20,810
going to be able to do it.

790
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:21,770
I mean, yeah.

791
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:24,460
So don't think that
these can all be done.

792
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:29,150
The equality, it's like
integrals in calculus.

793
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:31,020
No problem to think
of integrations that

794
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,620
are just beyond human capacity.

795
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,680
But the formulas still hold.

796
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:43,510
Suppose my region
was even like this?

797
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:48,340
Would that still be, do we still
see flow in equals flow out

798
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,320
for this particular flow?

799
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,780
I think, yeah, the
flow's going this way.

800
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,430
So it's coming in here,
it's going out again.

801
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:57,790
That contributes.

802
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,660
Back in again here,
and out again here.

803
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:09,290
Yeah, I think our instinct
would be correct there, yeah.

804
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:11,420
All sorts of examples.

805
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:16,890
I was going to, well,
I'll maybe do it in class.

806
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:20,750
This divergence theorem
is the fundamental theorem

807
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,920
of 2-D calculus, you could say.

808
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,930
Or one of them.

809
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:42,050
And to write these things and
see what they lead to, yeah.

810
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,500
I'll tell you what
I was going to do.

811
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:52,220
I was going to apply this to
the vector field u times w.

812
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:58,180
So u is a scalar, w is a vector,
and therefore uw is a vector.

813
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:06,230
It's got two components, uw_1,
are you willing to do that one?

814
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:16,820
So I apply this not to w
itself, but to u times w.

815
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:22,720
Which has two components,
uw_1 and uw_2.

816
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,460
OK, so I should take
the divergence of uw.

817
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:31,240
I mean, that's a vector
field, uw, this guy.

818
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,420
And I'll get the uw dot n.

819
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:41,700
And it just turns out that
this is the right way to do it.

820
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,750
To see the fact that
gradient and divergence

821
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,070
are transposes of each other.

822
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,100
Yeah, yeah.

823
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,060
I maybe I won't do
that calculation now,

824
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:55,790
I'll just say that if you take
the divergence theorem and you

825
00:50:55,790 --> 00:51:01,290
apply it to this
guy, [uw 1, uw 2],

826
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:10,190
and write out what it means, you
get a very interesting formula.

827
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:12,030
I'll just leave that there.

828
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:14,570
So I'm ready for a final
question if there is one,

829
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:21,940
or otherwise keep going Friday
with these Laplace equation

830
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,210
solutions.

831
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,780
Play with some vector fields.

832
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,740
That's my best advice.

833
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:34,090
And I'll see you Friday.
