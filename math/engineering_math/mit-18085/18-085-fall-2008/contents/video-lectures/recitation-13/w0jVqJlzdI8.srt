9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,520
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, so I
feel I should have brought

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,700
pizza instead of math problems.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:34,190
I mean, but this is
our final, final hour.

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,820
Open for any questions,
any discussion

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,210
about Fourier topics.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,610
Looking toward tomorrow
evening's exam.

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,140
And, well, hoping you'll
find the whole course

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,190
useful at many
times in the future.

17
00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:00,090
So, somebody emailed me
that the posted solution,

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,200
so I just posted
a quick solution

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,270
to the un-collected
homework ten,

20
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,590
and so I haven't even
looked to see what

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,590
did it say for this question.

22
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,760
But what is the answer?

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,320
If I convolve the delta function
with the delta function,

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,990
what do I get?

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,070
Delta, right.

26
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,930
If I convolve
anything with delta

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,850
I get delta because I'm
over in the other space.

28
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,760
I'm multiplying by one.

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,430
Yeah, so if I use the
convolution rule to go over

30
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,000
to the other space, where this
becomes just one times one

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,080
I'm getting one, and transform
back and I've got delta.

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,150
Well that question won't
be on tomorrow's exam.

33
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,770
But I thought we could
deal with that fast.

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,080
Now I'm open to questions
about any topic.

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,850
Homework or not.

36
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,940
Yeah, thanks.

37
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

38
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,460
PROFESSOR STRANG: I could try.

39
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,320
Did I make up the exam?

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,210
Probably.

41
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,530
Yeah, I'll recognize it.

42
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:14,050
OK, alright, I'll read it out.

43
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:25,180
OK, so this an exam from
2005, not that far back.

44
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,617
OK, so it has some questions.

45
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:33,450
Shall I tell you what
the whole question is,

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,320
but it looks like
this Part D is sort

47
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,930
of separate from the others.

48
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,610
But why not, this gives us
some questions to think about.

49
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,440
So if I just read
out the questions.

50
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:52,170
One was, find the coefficients
of-- The function is e^(-x).

51
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,620
That would naturally
occur to me as a function

52
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,240
that you could-- So,
from zero to 2pi.

53
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,890
And then periodic.

54
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,260
Always good to graph it.

55
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,910
So will e to the
minus x look like?

56
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:12,060
It'll come down to,
much steeper than that,

57
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,140
but that would do it.

58
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,710
So that's e^(-x).

59
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,920
Here it's one, and
here it's e^(-2pi).

60
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,620
And then repeat, repeat, repeat.

61
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,150
So find its Fourier
coefficients.

62
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,430
I'll just say what the
question is and you can ask me.

63
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,610
And then what's the decay rate.

64
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,520
Oh, maybe you can tell
me the decay rate.

65
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,660
Even before you tell
me the coefficient.

66
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,840
What would the decay rate
be if I expressed this

67
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:49,140
as a combination of
Fourier terms, harmonics.

68
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,840
How quickly will those
coefficients drop off?

69
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,040
So 1/k, only.

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:02,050
That's right, 1/k, because this
function has a jump at zero.

71
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:07,360
Well, at zero and again at 2pi,
at every one of those points.

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,540
It has a jump, I guess,
of about this distance,

73
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,670
between one and that number.

74
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,880
Which would be the jump that we
would see of course every time.

75
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,930
Yeah, so the coefficients
would decay like 1/k.

76
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:27,800
Then it asked to compute the sum
of those coefficients squared.

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,970
OK, so how can we find the sum
of those coefficients squared

78
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,040
even before I know
what they are?

79
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,140
Well, you know
the answer, right?

80
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,940
How am I going to
do this problem?

81
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,740
Yeah, so I'm looking for the sum
of the squares of coefficients

82
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,710
and then there's
this magic trick.

83
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,390
What is it that helps me to
find that sum of squares?

84
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,970
How do I go about that?

85
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,560
I connect it to the integral
of the function squared.

86
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,465
Integral zero to 2pi of
the function squared.

87
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:11,160
And you remember
the reason, and I've

88
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,950
left a little space
for the fudge factor.

89
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,070
2pi, or 1/(2pi), we can figure
out what it is by taking

90
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,190
a simple case.

91
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,490
Yeah, why don't we take a simple
case to figure out should there

92
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,770
be a 2pi or a 1/(2pi) or what?

93
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,530
What's a simple case here?

94
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,860
Suppose I take f(x)=1.

95
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,240
Suppose I take the function
f(x)=1, then the right side--

96
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,200
So if f(x) is one, the right
side would be 2pi, I guess,

97
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,630
the integral of one.

98
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,660
And the left side would be what?

99
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,870
What would be the
Fourier coefficients

100
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,510
of the constant function?

101
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,580
Well just c_0, the only one
we would have would be c_0,

102
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,150
the constant term, the c_0*e^0.

103
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,550
And it would be one.

104
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,890
So I'd have a one
there, when k is zero,

105
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,670
and otherwise I
wouldn't have anything.

106
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,690
So this would be one
squared, this would be a one.

107
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,600
So I do need to divide by 2pi.

108
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,610
Do you agree with that?

109
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:26,420
To make it correct I'd better
have a 1/(2pi) to get that

110
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,790
to be right.

111
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,770
OK, and then this gives
me the answer then,

112
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:38,540
I just do this integral,
e^(-2x), then f is e^(-x).

113
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,240
So f squared would be e^(-2x),
which I can certainly integrate

114
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,710
and get some expression.

115
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,890
Yeah, OK.

116
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,210
So that's a
straightforward part.

117
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:56,960
And now to the Part D, which you
asked about which is, oh wow.

118
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,700
OK, so now I'm asking
about an equation u, du/dx,

119
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,830
plus u(x) equals
a train of deltas.

120
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,860
So delta(x) made periodic.

121
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,360
Can I write it that way?

122
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,530
So this is the periodic case.

123
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,820
So I'm looking for
a periodic answer.

124
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,620
So I'm in the
Fourier series world

125
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,360
when I take-- I'll be
looking for coefficients, not

126
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,430
the integral transform.

127
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,750
OK.

128
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,140
So alright, so I'm
making it clear.

129
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,390
So how do I proceed now,
with such a problem?

130
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:45,100
So I've mentioned this morning
that a problem like this

131
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,800
could appear.

132
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,470
So I'm happy to discuss it.

133
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,730
What do I do?

134
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,700
Transform.

135
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,910
Absolutely.

136
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,650
Take Fourier transform.

137
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,440
OK, so what happens when I
take Fourier transforms of u?

138
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,410
Well, I guess, so
we're doing periodic,

139
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,660
so we're going to go
to coefficients, right?

140
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,710
I'll call them, shall I call,
shall-- I think of u(x),

141
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,620
shall I just call
its coefficient c?

142
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,700
It's the only function I have
around so I might as well use

143
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,580
c for it.

144
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,820
So here's the function,
and Fourier takes this

145
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,370
to the set of coefficients, OK.

146
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,610
And the point is that
we can separate--

147
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,500
I mean this is the whole
reason why Fourier's so great.

148
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,350
That we can do each
frequency separately.

149
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,510
So let's see then.

150
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:44,430
So this has coefficient c_k,
and what are the coefficients,

151
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:50,080
what's the k-th coefficient, so
this is all the e^(ikx) term.

152
00:08:50,080 --> 00:09:00,100
What's the k-th coefficient of
the derivative? ikc_k, right?

153
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,530
And what's the k-th coefficient
of the delta function?

154
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,100
One, right?

155
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,740
Is that right or is there
1/(2pi) or something?

156
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,900
Is it 1/(2pi)?

157
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,380
OK, 1/(2pi).

158
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,560
Yeah, I guess that's right.

159
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,610
Because the coefficient,
I would have

160
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:23,420
to take the integral
times, yeah, the integral

161
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,920
with the delta function
will give me the one,

162
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,670
and then there's a 1/2pi.

163
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,840
Right, OK.

164
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,040
So now I've got the answer.

165
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,890
Now I have this
equation at each k.

166
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,060
Following each
eigenvector, following

167
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,410
each separate frequency.

168
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,520
And it's easy to do.

169
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:53,180
It's just 1/(2pi) And
there's 1+ik, I think.

170
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,300
OK, and now those are the c_k's.

171
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,780
So I think maybe this is it.

172
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,630
Sum from minus infinity,
I know what the c_k is.

173
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,930
2pi(1+ik), times e^(ikx).

174
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,420


175
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,620
That's my u(x), I think.

176
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,830
Had to be, right?

177
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:26,100
So I just did the sort
of automatic steps.

178
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,020
When I made up
this exam, I don't

179
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,370
know whether I was thinking
I could find out-- Can

180
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:45,560
I actually do that sum to
produce some function u(x)

181
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,910
that I am familiar with.

182
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,890
I'm not sure.

183
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,190
Anybody reading the
question, so the question

184
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,440
says solve this
differential equation.

185
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,610
Doesn't say what
it means by solve.

186
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,710
Anyway, I've done it.

187
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,930
I guess.

188
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:13,410
Shall we agree that I
passed on this question?

189
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,620
If we knew some tricky
way to do this addition,

190
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,670
but I don't immediately see it.

191
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,330
So that's good.

192
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,380
OK, you're welcome.

193
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,210
Thanks.

194
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,070
OK, so that was a very
good question to ask.

195
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:32,120
Because it got,
it got the method

196
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,340
of how do you deal with
a differential equation.

197
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,220
By the way, this could be
a difference equation, too.

198
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,510
That could be u at
x+h minus u at x-h.

199
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:52,650
Shall I just emphasize that that
wouldn't have been any harder?

200
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:59,910
u(x+h)-u(x-h) over 2h,
let me take, for example,

201
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,760
plus u equals delta.

202
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,060
This is like I've taken a
centered difference there,

203
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,560
instead of a derivative.

204
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,780
How would you write
a solution to that?

205
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:18,374
Same method.

206
00:12:18,374 --> 00:12:19,540
So what would the method be?

207
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,700
I'd take transforms.

208
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,280
So here this would
have coefficient c_k,

209
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,350
this would have
coefficients 1/(2pi).

210
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,670
And what would be the
coefficients of these guys?

211
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,100
Well, there's a 1/(2h).

212
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,670
So what are the Fourier
coefficients of u(x+h)?

213
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,280
Just to see that
all these things--

214
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,040
I've got constant
coefficients here.

215
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,570
Why shouldn't Fourier work?

216
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:53,951
So if it's u(x+h), so there's
an e to the something factor,

217
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:54,450
right?

218
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,780
When I've shifted a function
then in the transform

219
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,370
I see an e to the i thing.

220
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,710
So let's just see.

221
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:10,000
If u(x), so if u(x) is
the sum of c_k*e^(ikx),

222
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:21,220
then u(x+h) would be the sum
of c_k*e^(ik(x+h)), right?

223
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,300
No, nothing surprising there.

224
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,220
So now I'm seeing the factor.

225
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,780
There's c_k, it's multiplied
by the factor e^(ikh).

226
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,110


227
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:43,210
So this is the same c_k, but
an e^(ikh), from that one.

228
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,030
And this would be the minus, and
this would shift the other way.

229
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:52,500
So it would be the same
c_k, and probably e^(-ikh).

230
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,470
If I did that right.

231
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,420
Yeah.

232
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,700
Anyway, once again, we
have still linear problem.

233
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:05,360
This is c_k times
something equals 1/(2pi).

234
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,060


235
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,030
By the way, this thing is
what I would call the transfer

236
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,590
function.

237
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,010
You see that language?

238
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,640
We haven't used
that language much.

239
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,950
Or at all, it's sort of more
of a systems theory, control

240
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,200
theory word.

241
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:29,520
But hey, we're always doing
the same correct thing.

242
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,670
That's the thing that transfers
the input to the output.

243
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,690
So maybe the transfer
function is one over.

244
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,940
Maybe I include the division
in the transfer function.

245
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,510
So finally I get c_k
is this 1/(2pi) guy,

246
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:52,410
divided by whatever that was,
1/(2h) times that number,

247
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,140
minus 1/(2h) of that plus one.

248
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,870
Whatever is
multiplying c_k there.

249
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,250
It's a transfer function.

250
00:14:59,250 --> 00:14:59,750
Yeah.

251
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,910
So there's another word which
we could have, and should have,

252
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,930
used before today.

253
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,870
But here it is.

254
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,920
OK, so that's some thoughts
about that question.

255
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,660
Any other direction to go?

256
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,737
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

257
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:17,070
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes. go ahead.

258
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,200
Yeah.

259
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

260
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,420
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Lab problem 12, OK.

261
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,000
4.5, Fourier
integrals, number 12.

262
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,360
Oh yeah, maybe that was also.

263
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,050
A question was
raised about was it

264
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:42,310
right on the posted solution.

265
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,040
So maybe not.

266
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,930
Let's see what we want to do.

267
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,400
Yeah I just thought
that was pretty-- I

268
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,700
could remember the day I
thought of this equation.

269
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,910
Integral of u minus derivative
of u equal delta(x).

270
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:02,030
I thought that's kind of
a cool looking equation.

271
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,440
But I don't know that I've
ever solved it, before.

272
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,410
So integral of u, actually
yeah, I look cheerful,

273
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:17,570
but-- So I'm finishing
the fourth edition

274
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,640
of the linear algebra book.

275
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,550
Introduction to Linear Algebra.

276
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,610
So I love writing.

277
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,910
I've done all the
writing and now comes

278
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:30,530
the only horrible part, solving
all those stupid exercises.

279
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:36,520
So that, you may think of me in
sunny Singapore or somewhere,

280
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,030
but what I'll be doing
is not on the beach.

281
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:46,740
It's in an office somewhere,
doing Problem 1.1.1,

282
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,870
and two, three, it's not life.

283
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,540
I mean, it's.

284
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,400
But, OK.

285
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,540
Anyway, that looks like
a pretty good equation.

286
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,880
And certainly I'm
going to transform it.

287
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,800
So I can see a little
question coming up.

288
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,770
So am in the Fourier
integral world, yeah.

289
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:15,630
So I should you use this
notation. u hat of k, right?

290
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:22,510
Over ik, is that the right
thing when I've integrated?

291
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,010
Yeah.

292
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,900
That's made it smoother.

293
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,840
That's dragging
the function down.

294
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,480
And I guess the one point
that's a little tricky there

295
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,600
is always, are you
dividing by zero.

296
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,440
Because zero is one
of the frequencies.

297
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,240
And so I sort of need u hat
of zero to be zero for this.

298
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,190
So it's looking slightly
dangerous at k=0,

299
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,880
but otherwise it's certainly
improving things by speeding up

300
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,100
the decay rate.

301
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,920
And then this would be minus
ik u hat of k, as we just said.

302
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,170
And this would be
the one, maybe it's

303
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,350
a one in the Fourier
integral world,

304
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,930
where the 2pi went
in a different point.

305
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,680
So I think that's, yeah.

306
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,220
So I would now just,
the usual thing

307
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,940
was the transfer function.

308
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,630
1/(ik)-ik, so that's
my transfer function.

309
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,640
That's multiplying u hat.

310
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,000
Maybe I can simplify
that by putting it

311
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,620
all over ik, one minus ik.

312
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,900
Is it plus k?

313
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,010
Does that look good, or does
that look bad? k squared?

314
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,840
Does that look better?

315
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:52,920
So I'm wondering, so over
here is k squared over ik,

316
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,830
is that the same
as the minus ik?

317
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,570
Yeah.

318
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,390
Yeah, bring it up and the
minus i squared is one

319
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,650
and I've got k squared.

320
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,560
Yeah, so this looks good.

321
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,250
So that's then, dividing by it
gives me, I'm dividing the one.

322
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,750
So u hat k is one over this.

323
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,140
So it's the transfer function.

324
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,550
One plus k squared.

325
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:25,110
OK.

326
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,500
I don't know whether
I had in mind

327
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,960
to go any further than this.

328
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,350
Did you get this far, or what?

329
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

330
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,700
PROFESSOR STRANG: It said that?

331
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,500
Oh jeez.

332
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,650
I bitterly regret
saying these things.

333
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,440
Yeah, OK.

334
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,760
I don't know u(x).

335
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,420
Did anybody have any luck?

336
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,940
You did.

337
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,290
Did I say it with a derivative?

338
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,980
Oh one, over one plus
k squared, oh yeah.

339
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,220
One over one plus k
squared, we know what to do.

340
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:06,090
And then ik will
take its derivative.

341
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,150
So what do we do if it's
one over one plus k squared?

342
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:15,240
That's the one where, that was
the guy which was the e^(-x),

343
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,400
right?

344
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,450
Oh, it's just one side.

345
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,480
No, two sides, isn't it?

346
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,380
Two sides, yeah.

347
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,550
Yeah, we just got a corner.

348
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,890
Yeah, OK.

349
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,620
That's looking good.

350
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,700
And now maybe I need to
divide by two. a is one here

351
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,670
but there is a division by two.

352
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,450
Yeah, that looks good.

353
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:44,450
OK, and now I take--
This function,

354
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,080
its transform has that.

355
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,270
And now if I want
to multiply by ik

356
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,560
I have to take the derivative.

357
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,400
So I believe with
your help here,

358
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,460
that the derivative
of that is the same.

359
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,880
Can I just take the derivative
while we're looking at it?

360
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,010
I mean e^x is the
most-- You know,

361
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,430
that was created to take
its derivative, right?

362
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,570
So its derivative is itself.

363
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,780
The derivative of
this is a minus.

364
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:22,530
So I think that maybe that's
the answer. e^x over two,

365
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,630
coming up to 1/2, I guess.

366
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,840
And then-- Oh, well
the picture won't look,

367
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,720
because of that minus sign.

368
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,310
Yeah.

369
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:31,860
Huh.

370
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:39,720
Good, because that minus sign,
it's minus e^(-x) over two.

371
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,500
So it starts at minus 1/2.

372
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,570
So there's a jump of one.

373
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,130
Or drop of one.

374
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:51,120
Is that right, there should
be a drop of one in u hat?

375
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,070
Probably.

376
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,010
Yeah, yeah.

377
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,480
The integral will
be smooth at zero,

378
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,470
where the delta
function's hitting us.

379
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,460
I have a minus sign
and a derivative.

380
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,250
But yeah, doesn't
that look good?

381
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:11,560
If the derivative has a delta,
the function has a jump.

382
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,530
And with that minus
sign, and with one delta,

383
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,000
the jump should
be a drop of one.

384
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,780
Which is that.

385
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,480
Yeah.

386
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,930
And the integral
minus the derivative

387
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,590
should be otherwise zero.

388
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:29,510
So again this is not
unrelated to exam questions.

389
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,370
I did all this stuff, and
I really should check,

390
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,330
did I get it right?

391
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,010
Does that solve the
differential equation?

392
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,386
I mean, you could say
of course it does if you

393
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:40,510
took all these steps right.

394
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,960
But it's wise to check.

395
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,350
Plug it in.

396
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,610
OK, it has the drop of one.

397
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:51,660
So it deals correctly with the
delta because, the derivative

398
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,590
has a delta.

399
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,170
And things match.

400
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,360
And now what else
do I have to check?

401
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,890
I have to check out all
the other points, right?

402
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,500
I've just checked that yep,
this answer is good at the jump.

403
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,710
The tricky point.

404
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,120
But now what about
all the other points?

405
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,540
So where the delta is
zero, I should just

406
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,380
check that the integral of u,
so what is the integral of u?

407
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:24,720
Let me just check for the
points left of the origin.

408
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,150
So I'm just going to
look at this part.

409
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,620
Yeah, x negative.

410
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,460
So its integral, what's the
integral of e^x over two?

411
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:42,680
I guess e^x over two, right?

412
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,990
Minus?

413
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,920
And what's the
derivative of e^x?

414
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,520
Oh, the derivative is also
e^x over two and I get zero,

415
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,800
or x negative.

416
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,940
As I want to.

417
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,370
Because the delta is
zero in that left side.

418
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,840
And similarly on the right side.

419
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,730
It should be OK.

420
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,590
And then the key point was
that the jump was right.

421
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,620
Yeah, so thank you.

422
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,340
That's good.

423
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:06,940
Yes please.

424
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

425
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,690
PROFESSOR STRANG: What, sorry?

426
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,820
Why did I take the derivative?

427
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,550
What will be the
derivative of this?

428
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,540
Yes, there is.

429
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,140
That's right.

430
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,270
What would be the
derivative of this?

431
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,800
Huh, yeah, good question.

432
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,220
What's the derivative
of this answer.

433
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:33,070
So it's that, on the left. and
then there's a delta function,

434
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,870
a minus delta, right,
because it's dropped down.

435
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,080
And then the derivative
of that is e^(-x).

436
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,910
Yeah, so if I graph
the derivative, cool.

437
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:50,750
I graph the derivative, it
looks like the function.

438
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:56,750
It has a spike going down there.

439
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,540
At the origin, and then the
derivative here is positive.

440
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,040
Right?

441
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,030
This function's coming up.

442
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,310
It's e^(-x) over two.

443
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,730
It's positive, it's there.

444
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,050
Yeah.

445
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,050
Oh wow, that's a nice graph.

446
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:17,620
So that's the derivative,
this is the graph of du/dx.

447
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,040
Yeah, thanks.

448
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,850
And similarly I could graph the
integral, the integral-- Well,

449
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,730
would you want to
see the integral?

450
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,590
Probably not.

451
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,810
Maybe, yeah.

452
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,020
The integral would probably
look pretty much just like that

453
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,320
but without the delta, yeah.

454
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,860
Cool, isn't that nice?

455
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,040
It's artistic.

456
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,820
That's the derivative,
and the integral

457
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,030
is the same thing
without the delta.

458
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:52,230
And when you subtract,
you get the delta.

459
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:57,890
OK, you sure you guys don't
want to come to Singapore

460
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,050
and help with these
problem solutions?

461
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,380
There's plenty for everybody.

462
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,820
OK.

463
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,760
Alright, so another question.

464
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,310
Yeah.

465
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,960
2005.

466
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,835
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

467
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:14,020
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, alright.

468
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,860
Yeah, which one?

469
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,501
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

470
00:26:19,501 --> 00:26:22,000
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, I'll just
read out the whole question.

471
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,040
Yeah.

472
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:32,870
So this is 2005, Problem 3.

473
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:37,970
OK it's a half-hat function.

474
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,340
This is Fourier integral,
because it's on the whole line.

475
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,150
And it's half a hat for--
Between zero and one,

476
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,950
the function is coming down.

477
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:53,150
And then otherwise it's zero.

478
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,390
So its graph, done.

479
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,560
Graph its derivative.

480
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,260
OK, let's graph the
derivative of that function.

481
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,250
Derivative is certainly
zero along there.

482
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,040
Then the derivative
is minus one here.

483
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,200
And then the derivative is zero.

484
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,720
So the derivative looks
to me like it's that, OK.

485
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,160
So yeah, that function--
Is that right?

486
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,660
No.

487
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,430
It's not right.

488
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,640
There's a delta.

489
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,150
That was the tricky
part of the problem.

490
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,270
Right, there's a delta
in the derivative,

491
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:35,220
right here because of that jump.

492
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,211
There's a delta.

493
00:27:37,211 --> 00:27:37,710
OK.

494
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,210
Good.

495
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,920
Now, is that better?

496
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,480
That's good.

497
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,550
OK.

498
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,120
What's its transform?

499
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,870
The transform of
this derivative.

500
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,120
What's the Fourier transform?

501
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,510
Well, I guess we got two parts.

502
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,660
So this is my function u'(x).

503
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,620
The derivative.

504
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,530
Now, what's u' transform?

505
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,460
So it should be a
function of k, now.

506
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,960
Alright, what do you think?

507
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,240
So it's the sum of two things.

508
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,260
That delta, which Fourier
transforms to one.

509
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:23,940
And this guy down below
between zero and one,

510
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,110
which was like the
one we did today,

511
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,300
we've got the integral
from zero to one.

512
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,120
Now it happens to be a
minus one e^(-ikx) dx.

513
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,150


514
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:44,140
And that, of course, we can do.

515
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,110
OK Oh, there's solutions here.

516
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

517
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,710
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

518
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,930
So OK, so I think
we're doing alright.

519
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:03,720
This expression is familiar.

520
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,500
It's 1-e^(-ik) over the ik.

521
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,840
Is that right?

522
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,700
We have a minus.

523
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,600
Is the minus, yeah, I
think the minus looks good.

524
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,610
And yeah, at least, that's
here and it's probably

525
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,520
got the minus signs correct.

526
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,790
So why was it?

527
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:32,390
I plugged in x=1, and
that's why I got an e^(-ik).

528
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,430
And then I plugged in x=0 and
that's where that one came

529
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,150
from.

530
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:42,850
OK, so, but your question
was about-- That was it?

531
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,410
Oh, I see.

532
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,840
OK.

533
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,910
Right, and then the next part
asked about the transform

534
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,830
of the original guy.

535
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,720
The transform of
the original guy.

536
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:00,280
Now, what would be the
transform of the original guy?

537
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:11,620
The original u.

538
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:17,310
Right, OK, yeah.

539
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,060
The reason I'm
sort of stuttering

540
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,760
is that if I'm
going to integrate--

541
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,240
I mean, what are you
going to tell me?

542
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,330
What's a quick way to find the
transform of the original u

543
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,060
now?

544
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,870
Divide by ik.

545
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,820
Divide by ik.

546
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,670
And then I'm all ready to do
that except I'm worried that

547
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,300
k=0.

548
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,730
But it should come
out alright, now.

549
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:47,900
So I have to hope that this
thing comes out to be zero

550
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,080
at k=0.

551
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,950
Can you see that it does?

552
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,880
What is, yeah?

553
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,210
This is a good point.

554
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:03,490
What does u hat
at zero represent?

555
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,620
Have you thought about that?

556
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,120
If I look at the Fourier
transform, which I've got here.

557
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,530
So let me write
what I've got here.

558
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:17,170
I've got here that Fourier
transform of this function.

559
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,690
And if I take the Fourier
transform of any function,

560
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,580
and I look at zero frequency.

561
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,820
What am I seeing?

562
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,800
The average, right.

563
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,240
I'm saying the average.

564
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,734
What's the average
value of that function?

565
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:33,900
We never thought about that.

566
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,120
But that's fun.

567
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,650
What's the average of this guy?

568
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,960
If I integrate over
the whole line.

569
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,560
Do I get zero?

570
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,690
Yes.

571
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:48,170
Because I get the integral of
the delta part gives me a one.

572
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,480
But the integral of this box
part gives me a minus one.

573
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,630
So the integral, so this
does equal zero at k=0,

574
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:00,840
and I can safely do
that division and get,

575
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:07,800
so now u hat of k is this
expression divided by ik.

576
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,090
So it's one minus this thing.

577
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,600
I'm just copying.

578
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,990
Minus ik, over ik, all
that divided by ik.

579
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,460
And I can, of course,
maneuver that some more

580
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,750
to make it look better.

581
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,750
OK, these are good
questions, because it's

582
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,680
giving me a few functions
to do the standard rules.

583
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:39,010
Shifting, integrating,
differentiating.

584
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,550
Oh, here's a Christmas present.

585
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,790
What does that mean?

586
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:47,740
Is the convolution of
this function with itself

587
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,100
the whole hat?

588
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,960
Why is that a Christmas present?

589
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,510
Is the convolution,
the convolution

590
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,430
of that with itself.

591
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:05,070
So first point, we don't want
to compute a convolution.

592
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,180
You may have
noticed, you have not

593
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,450
computed convolutions
of things like this.

594
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,000
It's not a lot of fun.

595
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,410
Because you have
that integral to do.

596
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,630
And you'd have to
separate out the parts

597
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,760
where it's this and the
part where it's this

598
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,010
and the parts where it's that.

599
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,350
It's not nice.

600
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,860
Much better to multiply
in the transform domain.

601
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,850
Much better.

602
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,710
OK, so if I multiply in
the transform domain,

603
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:40,420
I don't think I get the
Fourier transform of the hat.

604
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,670
Of the whole hat.

605
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,230
But can you give me
a convincing argument

606
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,880
for why-- This is, here
I'm in the transform domain

607
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,770
and I'm going to
convolve with itself,

608
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:59,970
so I'm just going to square it.

609
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:05,500
With the decay rate, what's
the decay rate as it is now?

610
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,120
The decay rate is, yes.

611
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,290
The decay rate is a good key.

612
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,050
So what is the decay
rate right now?

613
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,690
Here's a function with a jump.

614
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,250
So I know that even though
has a slightly messy

615
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,730
looking transform, I
know the decay rate.

616
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,570
It's what, with a jump is 1/k.

617
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,690
OK, so this must
be, and I sort of

618
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,630
do see a k down here,
so that's sensible.

619
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:35,770
OK, now, if I convolve, then
I multiply in this domain.

620
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,590
So that would give me the
k squared, as you said.

621
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:43,380
So could that be the
transform of the whole hat?

622
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:50,060
Does the whole hat
have a-- ooh, could be.

623
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,310
I'm pretty sure the answer's no.

624
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,740
Yeah, no way.

625
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:59,290
Yeah, I think that
that's the best answer.

626
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,050
I've lost the reason.

627
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,560
Because I'm getting the
k squared decay rate.

628
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,590
If I convolve
something with itself,

629
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:13,160
that would give me a k
squared, and the decay rate

630
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,070
for the transform of
the hat is a k squared.

631
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,840
But they wouldn't
be the same, yeah.

632
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,580
OK, yeah, I won't.

633
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,240
Yes, please.

634
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:29,990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

635
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,990
PROFESSOR STRANG: Right.

636
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,350
It's just convention.

637
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:36,160
The difference was that that was
the Fourier integral problem.

638
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,920
Where we put, you
might have noticed

639
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:45,970
that the 2pi goes on the other--
And this was the Fourier series

640
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:46,470
problem.

641
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,870
That was its only difference.

642
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,270
So it's just a convention.

643
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:54,800
And maybe other people would
choose a different convention.

644
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,940
So that is a slight
wiggle in the presentation

645
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,770
that the 2pi in the
Fourier integral section

646
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:09,830
got moved to the transform
in the other direction.

647
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,450
Yeah, good.

648
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,160
Yes, thanks.

649
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

650
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,920
PROFESSOR STRANG: Oh, OK.

651
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,310
I'm really just going by this
rule that if there is a jump

652
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,280
in the function,
and nothing worse,

653
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,520
then the decay rate is
1/k, and if there's a jump

654
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,170
in the derivative, as
there would be here --

655
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,400
so that has a jump in slope --
then the decay rate is one over

656
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
k squared and so on.

657
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,490
But those are the main cases.

658
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah, so I'm not using
anything deep there.

659
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,010
And by the way, I realize
here that one MATLAB problem

660
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:58,710
that I didn't assign this
semester but it's quite fun,

661
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:03,120
is to actually see
the Gibbs phenomenon.

662
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:09,240
We know the terms in the
Fourier series, with a jump.

663
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:16,590
And if you computed--
Make it the periodic case,

664
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:20,020
if you've computed the
terms in the Fourier series

665
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:24,140
they would stay
near here and then

666
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,320
I'd see the famous
Gibbs stuff here.

667
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,470
So that-- You know,
it's quite pleasant

668
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:37,370
to see the printout of
the Gibbs phenomenon.

669
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,950
Not getting any
shorter, just moving

670
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,810
closer to the jump as you
increase the number of terms.

671
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,920
Yeah, it's quite interesting.

672
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,510
But couldn't do everything.

673
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,760
Yeah, ready for more.

674
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,150
Any questions?

675
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,230
Well, these are good.

676
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,130
Yes, thanks.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

678
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,591
PROFESSOR STRANG: With
cyclic convolutions.

679
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:13,670
OK, what could I do with
cyclic convolutions?

680
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:17,440
Let's see.

681
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,770
What should I do with
cyclic convolutions?

682
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:30,240
I better make a little space.

683
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,880
Let me make a little
space and think.

684
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:43,460
Anybody got a suggested problem
for a cyclic convolution?

685
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,450
I mean, one type of
problem would certainly

686
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:59,140
be if I gave you a
cyclic convolution

687
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:05,030
and asked for-- I mean, the
direct way would be to say OK,

688
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:10,430
what's the cyclic convolution
of (1, 4, 2) cyclically

689
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:14,070
with (2, 1, 3) or something.

690
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,280
But you could-- That's
just a calculation,

691
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,050
so you would get that.

692
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:22,170
I won't discuss that further.

693
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:28,240
Now suppose I ask it with
the unknown, the thing

694
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,000
that I don't know here?

695
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,440
So let me do that.

696
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:40,790
Shall I say three,
yeah. (3, 1, 1).

697
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:48,320
Cyclically convolved with
some unknown (x_0, x_1, x_2)

698
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,140
equals some
right-hand side, what

699
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,010
should we take for the
right-hand side? (1, 1, 1),

700
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,250
for example?

701
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:05,350
OK, I'll erase the top one.

702
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:14,350
OK, how would you go with that?

703
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,470
So that's three by
three, three unknowns.

704
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,620
It's linear, so somehow
I could write that

705
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,960
as three equations
in three unknowns.

706
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,430
The question is how do I
get some insight into this.

707
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,390
And when I'm seeing
a convolution, what's

708
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,690
my immediate thought?

709
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,370
Transform.

710
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,010
That's what this
month is all about.

711
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,710
November.

712
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,010
So I'll take the
DFT of everything.

713
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:51,240
So what's the discrete Fourier
transform of (1, 1, 1)?

714
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,160
Up there is going
to be the transform.

715
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,830
So let me call it x_0
hat, x_1 hat, x_2 hat.

716
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,160
Just to emphasize.

717
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:07,800
So N is three here,
in this problem.

718
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,530
Or maybe c_0, c_1,
c_2 you might prefer.

719
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,830
Whatever.

720
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,150
And now this is going
to be a multiplication,

721
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:20,620
so in MATLAB notation
will be a dot star, right?

722
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,660
And so now I have to--
These are the known ones,

723
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,100
so what's the discrete Fourier
transform of (1, 1, 1),

724
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,270
the cyclic convolution of that?

725
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,330
It's (1, 0, 0) is it?

726
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,510
Or it's (3, 0, 0)?

727
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:42,710
Is it three-- I guess when
I asked that question,

728
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,760
you're open to two answers.

729
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:51,510
You could either be going from
x space to frequency space

730
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,760
or frequency to the other.

731
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,080
Because I haven't told
you what space we're in.

732
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,870
OK, let's go with that one.

733
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:07,830
How did you get to there?

734
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:10,770
You multiplied by the three
by three Fourier matrix,

735
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,410
is that what you did?

736
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,160
Alright, so now can
you do that here?

737
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,180
So separately I have to
do a little multiplication

738
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,240
of the three by
three Fourier matrix.

739
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,780
One, one-- Sorry,
let me get it right.

740
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,160
So I'm going to transform this.

741
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,890
Make a little space here.

742
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:29,800
Transform that.

743
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,370
So it's 1, 1, 1,
1, 1 and this is

744
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:38,190
w, w squared, w squared
and w to the fourth,

745
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,230
which is the same as w.

746
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:44,760
OK, and now I want to
multiply that by (3, 1, 1).

747
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,780
And get the answer there.

748
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,500
OK, so what do I have?

749
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,050
Five.

750
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,470
And what is that other one?

751
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,100
Oh, boy.

752
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:59,490
What is three plus
w plus w squared?

753
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:02,160
Anybody know that one?

754
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,360
Well, I do know what one
plus w plus w squared is.

755
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,560
It is zero.

756
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,570
Why is one plus w
plus w squared zero?

757
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,740
So I claim that if I have
three plus-- I think the answer

758
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,210
there is two.

759
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,540
And here I think I've also
got three, w, w squared,

760
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:24,060
I think if it was a one
the answer would be a zero.

761
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,810
But it's a three, so I
still have two there.

762
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,400
I think that's probably right.

763
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,410
Can I just remind you why?

764
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:38,760
There's one, there's w,
and there's w squared

765
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,060
and they add to zero.

766
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,930
Yeah, yeah.

767
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:47,020
For many reasons.

768
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,540
That's a very, very,
handy property.

769
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:55,450
That the sum of the
nth roots of one

770
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:58,710
add to zero, OK, so
now where I am I?

771
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:04,030
So I got (5, 2, 2).

772
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,690
So I've transformed.

773
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,980
Now what do I do next?

774
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,290
I divide.

775
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:18,070
So this is telling me that this
is three separate equations.

776
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:23,910
There's three, 2x_1 hat is zero.

777
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:24,700
Right?

778
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,110
No, x_2 hat.

779
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,740
And 2x_2 hat.

780
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,090
Sorry, one was right.

781
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:35,120
And 2x_2 hat is zero.

782
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:40,510
I'm just doing
the multiplication

783
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:41,780
as I'm supposed to.

784
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:46,380
In the other space it's at each,
for each component separately.

785
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:52,890
So now I know x_0 hat is
3/5, and the others are zero.

786
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,380
So now I know what
these numbers are.

787
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:01,270
Oh, yeah. (3/5, 0, 0).

788
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:08,200
And now what?

789
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,360
I mean, that statement's
clearly true, right?

790
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,320
Point star means five
times this gives me three.

791
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,700
Two times zero gives me zero,
two times zero gives zero.

792
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,590
So I'm golden, but
I'm not finished.

793
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:26,510
So that's not x,
that's its transform.

794
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:29,780
So what do I have to do?

795
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,930
Go back.

796
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:36,460
OK, so now can you
tell me what this is?

797
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,810
Up to a factor of 1/N,
or N, which we may

798
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:45,340
have to figure out separately.

799
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:50,970
So apart from this possibly
appearing, and probably

800
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:55,460
appearing, give me
an idea of what's

801
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:01,710
the inverse transform of
that? (3/5, 3/5, 3/5), good.

802
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:06,400
3/5, all three times.

803
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:16,140
OK, and now I can check
to see if it's right.

804
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:21,820
And again, I have not attempted
to get the 1/N's right,

805
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,420
I've just waited to the end.

806
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,510
So now I'll just
do this convolution

807
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:28,150
and see if I really
do get (1, 1, 1).

808
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,990
So can we do that convolution?

809
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:36,540
What's the typical,
say, this guy.

810
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,310
Where does that come
from in the convolution?

811
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:45,460
It comes from this, times what?

812
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,570
This.

813
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,280
That's the constant, right?

814
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,700
And that's the constant.

815
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,570
Contributes to the constant.

816
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:55,050
And what other products
contribute to the constant?

817
00:46:55,050 --> 00:47:00,860
So we're really seeing--
Thanks you for this question.

818
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:13,450
So this one
multiplies which one?

819
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,790
The answer is, this one
multiplies this guy.

820
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:19,620
You may say don't worry me about
it because they're the same.

821
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,600
But it's nice to know.

822
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,800
So this one multiplies this one.

823
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,860
And this guy
multiplies this guy.

824
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,720
And we'll remember
in a minute why.

825
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,210
And then you add them up,
that's what convolution is.

826
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:38,100
So I'm getting 9/5+3/5+3/5
is 15/5, so that's three.

827
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:43,470
So what's your conclusion here?

828
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,010
I should divide by three, right?

829
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,780
So I should divide by three.

830
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,730
So that's easy to do.

831
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:49,660
Those will all be one.

832
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,130
Yeah, OK.

833
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,350
So that's the right
answer, right?

834
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:59,620
And then I check
that it's right.

835
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:04,380
So let me just close by
remembering why was it--

836
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,790
So I'm doing just a
forward convolution here.

837
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,610
Solving the equation
was a deconvolution,

838
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:12,830
figuring out that x.

839
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:15,950
But now that I've got it
and I'm just checking,

840
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,580
that's just do it
forward and see

841
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,130
if you got the right answer.

842
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:24,220
And so we're just
remembering what

843
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:30,520
it means to do a convolution.

844
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,500
So you remember the
point about convolutions.

845
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:41,010
That if I'm convolving (a,
b, c) cyclically with (d, e,

846
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:45,450
f), that's a constant term.

847
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:48,720
Just tell me again, now, what's
the constant terms in this?

848
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:55,080
It's ad plus b times what?

849
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:01,830
This is the first term
in the convolution.

850
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:06,420
You remember that, the day
we brought convolutions

851
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,840
into the course?

852
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:13,100
What does b multiply? f, why f.

853
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:21,140
Because b is the coefficient of
w, if I'm taking polynomials,

854
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,920
this is a plus bw
plus c w squared,

855
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:29,740
and this corresponds to d
plus ew plus f w squared.

856
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,060
And I'm looking
for the constant.

857
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:35,440
So I get an a times a
d gives me a constant.

858
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:42,230
bw times what? times
f w squared gives me

859
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:46,240
the w cubed, which is
the one, so that bf here

860
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,860
and then there's a ce.

861
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:53,910
Because c w squared
multiplying ew

862
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:57,650
gives me the w cubed,
the one which folds in.

863
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:01,670
Yeah, OK, so anyway.

864
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,460
That's a quick reminder
of cyclic convolutions.

865
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,590
That was a good
question to ask, yeah.

866
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:12,440
You know, I fully realize this,
especially this third topic,

867
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,460
lots of things like this.

868
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,870
Straightforward if
you have lots of time,

869
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:20,390
but we had to keep moving.

870
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:25,950
So remembering what
cyclic convolution was

871
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:29,240
is a good chance to do it.
