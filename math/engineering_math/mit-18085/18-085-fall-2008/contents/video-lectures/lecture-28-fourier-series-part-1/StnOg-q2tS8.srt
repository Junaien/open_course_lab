AUDIENCE: OK.

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,490
I hoped I might have
Exam 2 for you today,

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,190
but it's not quite
back from the grader.

12
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:33,400
It's already gone to the second
grader, so it will not be long.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,670
And I hope you've had a
look at the MATLAB homework

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:45,650
for a variety of possible--
I think we've got,

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,910
there were some errors in
the original statement,

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,760
location of the coordinates,
but I think they're fixed now.

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,900
So ready to go on that MATLAB.

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,740
Don't forget that it's four
on the right-hand side and not

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,900
one, so if you get
an answer near 1/4

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,330
at the center of the
circle, that's the reason.

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,760
Just that factor
four is to remember.

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,420
I'll talk more about the
MATLAB this afternoon

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,000
in the review
session right here.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,380
Just to say, I'm highly
interested in that problem.

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,620
Not just increasing
N, the number

26
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,950
of mesh points in
the octagon, but also

27
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,190
increasing the number of sides.

28
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:42,530
So there are two numbers there,
we had N points on a ray,

29
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,600
out from the center.

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,290
But we have M sides
of the polygon.

31
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,320
And I'm interested in both
of those, getting big.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,200
Growing.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,650
I don't know how.

34
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:06,420
And maybe a reasonable
balance is to take,

35
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,810
I think N proportional to
M is a pretty good balance.

36
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,100
So I'd be very happy;
I mean I'm very

37
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,890
happy with whatever you do.

38
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,320
But I'm really interested
to know what happens

39
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,100
as both of these increase.

40
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,520
How close, how quickly
do you approach

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,930
the eigenvalues of a circle.

42
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,410
And you might keep
the two proportional

43
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,580
as you increase them.

44
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,850
So let me say more about that
this afternoon, because it's

45
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,790
a big day today,
to start Fourier.

46
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,450
Fourier series, the new
chapter, the new topic.

47
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,550
In fact, the final major
topic of the course.

48
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:51,810
So I tried to list here,
so here I'm in Section 4.1,

49
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,620
so I'm talking about
Fourier series.

50
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,990
So Fourier series is for
functions that have period 2pi.

51
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:05,440
It involves things like sin(x),
like cos(x), like e^(ikx),

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,110
all of those if I increase x by
2pi, I'm back where I started.

53
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,390
So that's the sort of functions
that have Fourier series.

54
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:21,880
Then we'll go on to the other
two big forms, crucial forms

55
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,920
of the Fourier world.

56
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,900
But 4.1 starts with the
classical Fourier series.

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,660
So I realize you will
have seen, many of you

58
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,610
will have seen
Fourier series before.

59
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,190
I hope you'll see
some new aspects here.

60
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:48,030
So, let me just get organized.

61
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,140
It's nice to have some examples
that just involve sine.

62
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,680
And since the sine is
an odd function, that

63
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,500
means it's sort of
anti-symmetric across zero,

64
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,820
those are the functions that
will have only sine, that

65
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,960
will have a sine expansion.

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,590
Cosines are the opposite.

67
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,340
Cosines are symmetric
across zero.

68
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,800
Like a constant, or like cos(x).

69
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,650
Zero comes right at
the symmetric point.

70
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,320
So those will have only cosines.

71
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,660
And a lot of examples fit in
one or the other of those,

72
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,180
and it's easy to see them.

73
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,050
The general function, of course,
is a combination odd and even.

74
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,870
It has cosines and
it has sines, it's

75
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,330
just the sum of the two pieces.

76
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,160
So, this is the
standard Fourier series,

77
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,060
which I couldn't
get onto one line,

78
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,590
but it has all the
cosines including

79
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,740
this slightly different
cos(0), and all the sines.

80
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,640
But because this one has
these three different pieces,

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,970
the constant term, the other
cosines, all the sines,

82
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,590
three slightly
different formulas,

83
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,120
it's actually nicest of
all, to use this final form.

84
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,150
Because there's
just one formula.

85
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,520
There's just one kind.

86
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,380
And I'll call its
coefficient c_k,

87
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,210
and now they multiply e^(ikx),
so we have to get used

88
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,770
to e^(ikx).

89
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,430
We may be more familiar
with sin(kx) and cos(kx),

90
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,050
but everybody knows e^(ikx)
is a combination of them.

91
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,710
And if we let k go from
minus infinity to infinity,

92
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,410
so we've got all the
terms, including e^(-i3x),

93
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:49,840
and e^(+i3x), those would
combine to give cosines

94
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,480
and sines of 3x.

95
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,800
We get one nice formula.

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,350
There's just one
formula for the c's.

97
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,500
So that's one good reason
to look at the complex form.

98
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,110
Even if our function
is actually real.

99
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,980
That form is kind of neat,
and the second good reason,

100
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,380
the really important
reason, is then

101
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,630
when we go to the discrete
Fourier transform,

102
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,190
the DFT, everybody writes
that with complex numbers.

103
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,670
So it's good to see
complex numbers first

104
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:30,320
and then we can just
translate the formulas from--

105
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,510
And these are also almost always
written with complex numbers.

106
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:39,850
So this is the way to see it.

107
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,130
OK, so what do we do
about Fourier series?

108
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,080
What do we have
to know how to do

109
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,990
and what should we understand?

110
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,040
Well, if you've
met Fourier series

111
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,800
you may have met the formula
for these coefficients.

112
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,140
That's sort of like step one.

113
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,340
If I'm given the function,
whatever the function might be,

114
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,710
might be a delta function.

115
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,240
Interesting case, always.

116
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,340
Always interesting.

117
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,970
Always crazy right?

118
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,370
But it's always interesting,
the delta function.

119
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,320
The coefficients
can be computed.

120
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,470
The coefficients, you'll see,
I'll repeat those formulas.

121
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:26,110
They involve integrals.

122
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,230
What I want to say
right now is that this

123
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,380
isn't a course in integration.

124
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,770
So I'm not interested in doing
more and more complicated

125
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,030
integrals and finding
Fourier coefficients

126
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,850
of weird functions.

127
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,760
No way.

128
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,480
I want to understand
the simple, straight,

129
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,280
the important examples.

130
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,970
And here's a point that's
highly interesting.

131
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,900
In practice, in
computing practice,

132
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,960
we're close to
computing practice here.

133
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,630
In everything we do.

134
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,020
I mean, this is really
constantly used.

135
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,380
And one important question is,
is the Fourier series quickly

136
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,374
convergent?

137
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:10,790
Because if we're
going to compute,

138
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,640
we don't want to compute
a thousand terms.

139
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,850
Hopefully ten terms, 20 terms
would give us good accuracy.

140
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,370
So that question comes down
to how quickly does those a's

141
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,320
and b's and c's go to zero?

142
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,580
That's highly important.

143
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,270
And you'll connect
this decay rate,

144
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,760
we'll connect this with the
smoothness of the function.

145
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,770
Oh, I can tell you
even at a start.

146
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,220
OK, so I just want to
emphasize this point.

147
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:50,060
We'll see it over and over
that like for a delta function,

148
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:56,140
which is not smooth at all,
we'll see no decay at all.

149
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,800
In the coefficients.

150
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,110
They're constant.

151
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,820
They don't decrease as we go to
higher and higher frequencies.

152
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:13,800
I think of k here, I'll use
the word frequency for k.

153
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,260
So high frequency means high
k, far up the Fourier series,

154
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,350
and the question is, are
the coefficients staying up

155
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,240
there big, and we have
to worry about them?

156
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,200
Or do they get very small?

157
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,970
So a delta function is
a key example and then

158
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,170
a step function.

159
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,590
So what will be the
deal with those?

160
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,330
If I have a function
that's a step function,

161
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:44,730
I'll have decay at rate is 1/k..

162
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,490
So they do go to zero.

163
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:53,040
The thousandth coefficient
will be roughly of size 1/1000.

164
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,930
That's not fast.

165
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:02,210
That's not really fast
enough to compute with.

166
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:08,430
Well, we meet step functions,
I mean, functions with jumps.

167
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,450
And we'll see that their
Fourier series, the coefficients

168
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,840
do go to zero but not very fast.

169
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,590
And we get something
highly interesting.

170
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,850
So when we do these
examples, so I've

171
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,130
sort of moved on to examples,
so these are two basic examples.

172
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,160
What would be the next example?

173
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,780
Step function.

174
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,200
Well, yeah, or maybe a hat next.

175
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,840
A hat function would be, you
see what I'm doing at each step?

176
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,140
I'm integrating.

177
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,200
A hat function might be the
next, yeah, a ramp, exactly.

178
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,520
Hat function, which is
a ramp with a corner.

179
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,960
Now, so that's one
integral better.

180
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,740
You want to guess the decay
rate on that one? k squared.

181
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,220
Now we're getting better.

182
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,080
That's a faster follow-up.

183
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,310
One over k squared.

184
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,220
And then we integrate again,
we'd get one over k cubed.

185
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,520
Then one more integral,
one over k fourth

186
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,080
would be a cubic spline.

187
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,020
You remember the cubic
spline is continuous.

188
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,050
Its derivative is
continuous, that

189
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,950
gives us a one over k cubed.

190
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,930
Its second derivative
is continuous,

191
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,320
that gives us a one
over k to the fourth,

192
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,060
and then you really
can compute with that,

193
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,270
if you have such a function.

194
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,510
So, point: pay
attention to decay rate.

195
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:37,000
That, and the connection
to smoothness.

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,520
So examples, we'll start
right off with these guys.

197
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,560
And then we'll see the
rules for the derivative.

198
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,890
Oh yeah, rules for
the derivative.

199
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,200
The beauty of Fourier series
is, well, actually you

200
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,270
can see this.

201
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,170
You can see the rule.

202
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,630
Let me just show you
the rule for this.

203
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:04,200
So the rule for derivatives,
the whole point about Fourier

204
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,890
is, it connects
perfectly with calculus.

205
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,690
With taking derivatives.

206
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:16,310
So suppose I have F(x)
equals, I'll use this form,

207
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,360
the sum of c_k e^(ikx).

208
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,290


209
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,230
And now I take its derivative.

210
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,700
dF/dx.

211
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,850
What do you think is the
derivative, what's the Fourier

212
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,500
series for the derivative?

213
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,940
Suppose I have the Fourier
series for some function,

214
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,520
and then I take Fourier
series for the derivative.

215
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,000
So I'm kind of going
the backwards way.

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,520
Less smooth.

217
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,020
I'm going from, the derivative
of the step function

218
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,400
involves delta functions,
so I'm going less smooth

219
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,720
as I take derivatives.

220
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,520
It's so easy, it jumps at you.

221
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,390
What's the rule?

222
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,240
Just take the derivative
of every term,

223
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,850
so I'll have the sum
of, now what happens

224
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,700
when I take the derivative?

225
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,290
Everybody see what
happens when I

226
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,250
take the derivative of that
typical term in the Fourier

227
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,070
series?

228
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,050
What happens?

229
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,450
The derivative brings
down a factor ik.

230
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:32,180
With k being the thing that--
So it's ik times what we have.

231
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:38,200
So these are the Fourier
coefficients of the derivative.

232
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,260
And that again makes exactly the
same point about the decay rate

233
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,000
or the opposite,
the non-decay rate.

234
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,390
As I take the derivative you
got a rougher function, right?

235
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,430
Derivative of a step function
is a delta, derivative of a hat

236
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,250
would have some steps.

237
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,580
We're going less smooth as
we take more derivatives.

238
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,430
And every time we
do it, we see, you

239
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,520
understand the decay rate now?

240
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,510
Because the derivative
just brings a factor ik,

241
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:18,640
so its high frequencies
are more present.

242
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,900
Have larger coefficients.

243
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,760
So and of course,
the second derivative

244
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,200
would bring down ik squared.

245
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:35,080
So that our equations,
for example,

246
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,180
let me just do an
application here.

247
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,300
Without pushing it.

248
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,220
Our application, we started
this course with equations like

249
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,750
-u''(x) = delta(x-a).

250
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,770
Right?

251
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,290
If we wanted to apply to
a differential equation,

252
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,890
how would I do it?

253
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,560
I would take the Fourier
series of both sides.

254
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,750
I would look at, I'd jump
into what people would

255
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,880
call the frequency domain.

256
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,980
So this is a differential
equation written as usual

257
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,850
in the physical domain.

258
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,060
And with physical
variable x, position.

259
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,710
Or it could be time.

260
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,100
And now let me take
Fourier transforms.

261
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,800
So what would happen here?

262
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,870
If I take the Fourier
transform of this,

263
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,000
well, we'll soon see, right?

264
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,100
We get Fourier
coefficients of the deltas.

265
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,800
Of the delta function.

266
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,350
That's a key example,
and you see why.

267
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,970
Over here, what will we get?

268
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,930
And now I'm taking
two derivatives,

269
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,560
so I bring down ik twice.

270
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,820
So I'm looking.

271
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,660
Here it would be
the sum of whatever

272
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,440
the delta's coefficients are.

273
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,840
Shall we call those d?

274
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,490
The alphabet's coming
out right. d for delta.

275
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,750
So the right side has
coefficients, d_k.

276
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,130
And what about the left side?

277
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,700
What are the coefficients--
If the solution

278
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:15,270
u has coefficients c_k,
so let's call this u now.

279
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,380
Has coefficients c_k,
then what happens

280
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,430
to the second
derivative? ik, ik again,

281
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,050
that's i squared k
squared, the minus sign.

282
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:33,270
So we would have the sum
of k squared c_k e^(ikx).

283
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:38,200
This is if u itself has
coefficient c_k, then -u'' has

284
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,750
these coefficients.

285
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,140
So what's up?

286
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,380
How would we use that?

287
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,640
It's going to be easy.

288
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,760
We'll just match terms.

289
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,580
Right?

290
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,690
I can see, what's my
formula, what should c_k

291
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,880
be if I know the d_k?

292
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,440
I'm given the right-hand side.

293
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,200
We're just doing what's
constantly happening,

294
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,090
this three step process.

295
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,710
You're given the right side.

296
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:09,820
Step one, expand it
in Fourier series now.

297
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,070
Step two, match the two sides.

298
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,720
So what's the formula for c_k?

299
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,120
In this application,
which, by the way

300
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,650
I had no intention to do this.

301
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,520
But it jumped into my head and
I thought why not just do it.

302
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,670
What would be the
formula for c_k?

303
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,420
It'll be d_k divided
by? k squared.

304
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,680
You're just matching terms.

305
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,960
Just the way, when we expanded
things in eigenvectors,

306
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,130
we'd match the coefficients
of the eigenvectors,

307
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,230
and that involved
just the simple step,

308
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,740
here it's d_k over k squared.

309
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,500
Good.

310
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,610
And then what's the final step?

311
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,280
The final step is, now you
know the right coefficients,

312
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,150
add them back up.

313
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,540
Add the thing back
up, like here,

314
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:10,701
only I'm temporarily calling
it u, to find the solution.

315
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:11,200
Right?

316
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,930
Three steps.

317
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,480
Go into the frequency domain.

318
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,410
Write the right-hand
side as a Fourier series.

319
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,460
Second quick step is
look at the equation

320
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,600
for each separate
Fourier coefficient.

321
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,610
Match the coefficients
of these eigenvectors.

322
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,670
Eigenfunctions.

323
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,790
And that's this
quick middle step.

324
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,600
And then you've got the
answer, but you're still

325
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,570
in Fourier space, you're
still in frequency space.

326
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,750
So you have to use
these, put them back

327
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,090
to get the answer
in physical space.

328
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:51,660
Right?

329
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,180
That's the pattern.

330
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,140
Over and over.

331
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,280
So that's sort of the general
plan of applying Fourier.

332
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,290
And when does it work?

333
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,710
When does it work?

334
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,690
Because, I mean it's
fantastic when it works.

335
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:13,520
So what is it about this
problem that made it work?

336
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,920
When is Fourier happy?

337
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,840
You know, when does
he raise his hand,

338
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,210
say yes I can
solve that problem?

339
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:26,200
OK, what do I need here
for this plan to work?

340
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,830
I certainly don't need always
just -u'', Fourier could do

341
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,750
better than that.

342
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:37,340
But what's the requirement
for Fourier to work perfectly?

343
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,860
Well, linear equation, right?

344
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,380
If we didn't have
linear equations

345
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,640
we couldn't do all this
adding and matching and stuff.

346
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,600
So linear equations.

347
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,340
Well, OK.

348
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,070
Now, what other
linear equations?

349
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,590
Could I have a c(x) in here?

350
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,070
My familiar c(x),
variable material property

351
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,070
inside this equation?

352
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,320
No.

353
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,940
Well, not easily, anyway.

354
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,930
That would really mess
things up if there's

355
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:13,580
a variable coefficient
in here then

356
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,760
it's going to have its
own Fourier series.

357
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,480
We're going to be
multiplying Fourier series.

358
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,380
That comes later and
it's not so clean.

359
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,500
So we want, it
works perfectly when

360
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,110
it's constant coefficients.

361
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:33,220
Constant coefficients in
the differential equations.

362
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,090
And then one more thing.

363
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,470
Very important other thing.

364
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,710
The boundary conditions.

365
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,850
Everybody remembers
now, it's a part

366
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:47,180
of the message of this course
is that boundary conditions are

367
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,980
often a source of trouble.

368
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,800
They're part of the problem,
you have to deal with them.

369
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,030
Now, what boundary conditions
do we think about here?

370
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:02,070
Well, fixed-fixed
was where we started.

371
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,420
So if we had fixed-fixed
boundary conditions what would

372
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,390
I expect?

373
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:12,450
Then things would give me
a sine series, possibly.

374
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,640
Because those are the
eigenfunctions we're used to.

375
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,800
Fixed-fixed, it's sines that
go from zero back to zero.

376
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,770
Fixed-free will have
some sines or cosines.

377
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,020
Periodic would be
the best of all.

378
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:32,040
Yeah, so we need nice
boundary conditions.

379
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:38,060
So the boundary conditions,
let me just say,

380
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,860
periodic would be great.

381
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:47,200
Or sometimes fixed-free.

382
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,430
Our familiar ones, at
least in simple cases,

383
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,890
can be dealt with.

384
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,540
OK.

385
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:04,790
So now, boy, that board is
already full of formulas.

386
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,640
But, let's go back to
the start and say how

387
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,290
do we find the coefficients?

388
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,300
So because that
was the first step.

389
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,270
Take the right-hand side,
find its coefficient.

390
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,250
If we want to, just as
applying eigenvalues,

391
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,990
the first step is
always find eigenvalues.

392
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,440
Here, in applying
Fourier, the first step

393
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,380
is always find the coefficients.

394
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,640
So, how do we do that?

395
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,270
And at the beginning it
doesn't look too easy, right?

396
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,410
Because let me take
the first guy, sin(x).

397
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,390
Let me take an example.

398
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,550
A particular S(x).

399
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,360
The most important,
interesting function.

400
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,620
S(x), I want it to
be an odd function,

401
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,620
so that it will have only sines.

402
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,500
And it should have period 2pi.

403
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,480
So let me just graph it.

404
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,910
So it's going to
have coefficients,

405
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:14,030
and I use b for sine, so it's
going to have b_1*sin(x),

406
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:18,310
and b_2*sin(2x), and so on.

407
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,830
And so it's got a whole
infinity of coefficients.

408
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,330
Right?

409
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,440
We're in function space.

410
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,930
We're not dealing
with vectors now.

411
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,480
So how is it possible to
find those coefficients?

412
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,840
And let me chose
a particular S(x).

413
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,250
So I'll put, since
it's 2pi periodic,

414
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:45,100
if I tell you what it
is over a 2pi interval,

415
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,260
just repeat, repeat, repeat.

416
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:52,300
So I'll pick the 2pi interval
to be minus pi to pi here.

417
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,670
Just because it's a nice way,
and so that's a 2pi length.

418
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,200
There's zero, I want to
function to be odd across zero.

419
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,060
And I want it to be
simple, because it's

420
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,240
going to be an important example
that I can actually compute.

421
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,480
So I'm going to make it a one.

422
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,640
And a minus one there.

423
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,380
So, a step function.

424
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:21,030
A step function, a square--
And if I repeat it, of course,

425
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,540
it would go down,
up, down, up, so on.

426
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:30,590
But we only have to
look over this part.

427
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,020
OK.

428
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,060
Now, well, you might
say wait a minute

429
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,690
how are we going to expand
this function in sines.

430
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,010
Well, sines are odd functions.

431
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,260
Everybody knows what odd means?

432
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:56,000
Odd means that S(-x) is -S(x).

433
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,690
So that's the anti-symmetric
that we see in that graph.

434
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,960
We also see a few
problems in this graph.

435
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,710
At x=0, what is our sine
series going to give us?

436
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:16,110
If I plug in x=0 on the
right-hand side I get zero,

437
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:16,790
certainly.

438
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,220
So this sine series
is going to do that.

439
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,040
And actually Fourier
series tend to do this.

440
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,790
In the middle of
a jump it'll pick

441
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,130
the middle point of a jump.

442
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:31,310
Fourier series generally,
it's the best possible,

443
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,390
will pick the middle
point of the jump.

444
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,540
And what about at x=pi?

445
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,070
At the end of the interval?

446
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,910
What does my series
add up at x=pi?

447
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,710
Zero again, because
sin(pi), sin(2pi), all zero.

448
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,560
And that'll be in the
middle of that jump.

449
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,500
So it's pretty good.

450
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,720
But now what I'm hoping
is that my sine series

451
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,520
is going to somehow get
real fast up to one,

452
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,100
and level out at one.

453
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,370
We're asking a lot.

454
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:12,440
In fact, when Fourier proposed
this idea, Fourier series,

455
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,400
there was a lot of doubters.

456
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:23,740
Was it really possible to
represent other functions,

457
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,470
maybe even including
a step function,

458
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,390
in terms of sines
or maybe cosines?

459
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,640
And Fourier said
yes, go with it.

460
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,570
So let's do it.

461
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:42,510
OK, so and he turned out
to be incredibly right.

462
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,880
How do I find b_2?

463
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,640
Do you remember how to-- I
don't want to know the formula.

464
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,230
I want to know why.

465
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:56,440
What's the step to find
the coefficient b_2?

466
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:02,400
Well, the step
is-- The key point.

467
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,950
Which makes everything possible.

468
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:07,770
Why don't I identify
the key point

469
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,130
without which we would
be in real trouble.

470
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:17,010
The key point is that
all these sine functions,

471
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:22,720
sin(2x), sin(3x),
sin(4x), are orthogonal.

472
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,340
Now, what do I mean by two
functions being orthogonal?

473
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,440
Somehow my picture
in function space,

474
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,695
so my picture in
function space is

475
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:38,030
that here is, this is
the sine x coordinate.

476
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,600
And somewhere there's a sin(2x)
coordinate and it's 90 degrees

477
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,160
and then there's a
sin(3x) coordinate,

478
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,510
and then there's a sine, I
don't know where to point now.

479
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,340
But there is a sin(4x),
we're in infinite dimensions.

480
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:56,990
And the sine vectors
are an orthogonal basis.

481
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,730
They're orthogonal
to each other.

482
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,640
What does that mean?

483
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,800
Vectors, we take
the dot product.

484
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,610
Functions, we take, we don't
use the word dot product as much

485
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,020
as inner product.

486
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,510
So let me take the inner
product of-- The whole point

487
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,460
is orthogonality.

488
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,250
Let me write that word down.

489
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,040
Orthogonal.

490
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,990
The sines are orthogonal.

491
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,450
And what does that mean?

492
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:27,280
That means that the integral
over our 2pi interval,

493
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,320
or any 2pi interval,
of one sine, sin(kx),

494
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,810
let's say, multiplied by
another sine, sin(lx),

495
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:42,600
dx is, you can guess the answer.

496
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,880
And everything is
depending on this answer.

497
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,610
And it is?

498
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,060
Zero.

499
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,400
It's just terrific.

500
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,840
If k is different
from l, of course.

501
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,310
If k is equal to l then I
have to figure that one out.

502
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,310
I'll need that one.

503
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:09,380
What is it if sine, if k=l so
I'm integrating sine squared

504
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,770
of kx, then it's
certainly not zero.

505
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,600
I getting like,
the length squared

506
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,820
of the sin(kx) function.

507
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:25,100
If k=l, what is it?

508
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,490
It has some nice formula.

509
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,210
Very nice.

510
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:28,880
Let's see.

511
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,710
Sine squared, do I need to
think about sine squared kx?

512
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,150
Sine squared kx,
what does it do?

513
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,640
Well, just graph sine squared x.

514
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,370
What would the graph
of sine squared x

515
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:48,020
look like, from minus pi to pi?

516
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,110
So it goes up, right?

517
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,960
Doesn't it go up?

518
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,350
And then it goes back down.

519
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,890
OK.

520
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:00,270
Sorry, I made that
a little hard.

521
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,410
Is that right?

522
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,850
And then it keeps it up.

523
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,350
Right.

524
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,660
So, what's the integral of that?

525
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,020
I'm not seeing quite why.

526
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,410
The answer is its
average value is 1/2.

527
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:23,170
The integral of sine squared
is half of the length.

528
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:28,000
The whole interval
is of length 2pi,

529
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,390
and we're taking the
area under sine squared.

530
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,540
I may have to come back
to it, but the answer

531
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,690
would be half of
2pi, which is pi.

532
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,690
Yeah, yeah.

533
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,830
So you could say the
length of the sine function

534
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:46,000
is square root of pi.

535
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,010
So these are integrals.

536
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:51,830
You told me the answer was zero.

537
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,610
And I agreed with you, but
we haven't computed it.

538
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,900
And nor have we really got that.

539
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,020
So a little bit to fix, still.

540
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:08,190
But the crucial
fact, I mean, those

541
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,920
are highly important integrals
that just come out beautifully.

542
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,600
And beautifully
really means zero.

543
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,610
I mean, that's the beautiful
number, right, for an integral.

544
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,440
OK, so now how do I use that?

545
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,550
Again, I'm looking for b_2.

546
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,950
How do I pick off
b_2, using the fact

547
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:37,370
that sin(2x) times any other
sine integrates to zero.

548
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,360
Ready for the moment?

549
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,520
To find the coefficient b_2?

550
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,690
I should, let me start this
sentence and if you finish it.

551
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:51,940
I'll multiply both sides of
this equation by sin(2x).

552
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,990
And then I will integrate.

553
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,680
I'll multiply both
sides by sin(2x),

554
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,890
so I take S(x) sin(2x).

555
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:12,350
And on the right hand, I
have b_1 sin(x) sin(2x).

556
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,380
And then I have
b_2-- Now, here's

557
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,960
the one that's going to live
through the integration.

558
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,300
It's going to survive, because
it's the sin(2x) times sin(2x),

559
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,290
sin(2x) squared.

560
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:34,650
And then comes the b_3 guy,
would be b_3 sin(3x) sin(2x).

561
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,850


562
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,320
Everybody sees what I'm doing?

563
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,090
As we did with the weak form
in differential equations,

564
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,130
I'm multiplying
through by these guys.

565
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:51,560
And then I'm integrating
over the interval.

566
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,750
And what do I get?

567
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,170
Integrate everyone dx.

568
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,060
And what's the result?

569
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:06,760
What is that integral?

570
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,270
Zero.

571
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,530
It's gone.

572
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,280
What is this
integral, the integral

573
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,630
of sin(3x) times sin(2x)?

574
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,570
Zero.

575
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,580
All those sines
integrate to zero,

576
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:25,250
and I have to come back and
see it's a simple trig identity

577
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,350
to do it.

578
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,140
To see why that's zero.

579
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,770
Do you see that everything
is disappearing, except b_2.

580
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,050
So we finally have the
formula that we want.

581
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:42,070
Let me just with put
these formulas down.

582
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:47,680
So b_k, b_2 or b_k, yeah
tell me the formula for b_k.

583
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,490
Let me go back, here.

584
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,590
What did b_2 come out to be?

585
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,620
So I have b_2, that's a number.

586
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,230
It's got this right-hand side.

587
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,760
That's the integral
that I mentioned.

588
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,230
You'd have to compute
that integral.

589
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,750
And then what about this stuff?

590
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,850
This sin(2x) squared?

591
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:13,160
I've integrated that.

592
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,930
And what did I get for that?

593
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:20,310
This is b_2, and then
this is some number.

594
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,400
And it's pi.

595
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,010
So this is b_2, and
multiplying, right?

596
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,750
That b_2 comes out,
and then I have

597
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,860
the integral of sine squared
2x, and that's what's pi.

598
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:37,210
So that's b_2 times pi here,
and I just divide by the pi.

599
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:41,400
So I divide by pi and
I get the integral

600
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:52,440
from minus pi to pi of my
function times my sine.

601
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:58,250
That's the model for
all the coefficients

602
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,850
of orthogonal series.

603
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,490
That's the model.

604
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:11,000
Cosines, the complete ones,
the complex coefficients.

605
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,210
The Legendre series,
the Bessel series,

606
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:18,440
everybody's series will
follow this same model.

607
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,750
Because all those series are
series of orthogonal functions.

608
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,910
Everything is hinging
on this orthogonality.

609
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:31,340
The fact that one term
times another gives zero.

610
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,250
What that means, really.

611
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:41,970
I want to say it
with a picture, too.

612
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,540
So let me draw two
orthogonal directions.

613
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:53,700
I intentionally didn't make
them just x and y axes.

614
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,350
This might be the
direction of sin(x),

615
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:00,440
and this might be the
direction of sin(2x).

616
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,090
And then I have a function.

617
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,060
And I'm trying to find
out how much of sin(2x)

618
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,160
has it got in it?

619
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,090
How much of sin(x)
has it got in it,

620
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,750
and then of course there's also
a sin(3x) and all the other

621
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,550
sin(kx)'s.

622
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:22,870
The point is, the point
of this 90 degree angle

623
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:34,160
there is, that I can split this
S(x), whatever it might be,

624
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,000
I can find its sin(x)
piece directly.

625
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,840
By just projecting it,
it's the projection

626
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,090
of my function on
that coordinate.

627
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,060
If you don't like
sin(x), sin(2x), S(x),

628
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,630
write v_1, v_2, whatever.

629
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,180
To think of it as vectors.

630
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:01,580
What's the sin two--
So that is b_1*sin(x).

631
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,730
That's the right
amount of sin(x).

632
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:12,590
And the whole point is that that
calculation didn't involve b_2

633
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,590
and b_3 and all the other b's.

634
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:19,310
When I'm projecting onto
orthogonal directions,

635
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:22,070
I can do them one at a time.

636
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:25,920
I can do one one-dimensional
projection at a time.

637
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:35,360
This b_k*sin(kx) is the, so
I'm just saying this in words,

638
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:44,820
is the projection of my
function onto sin(kx).

639
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,610
And the point is, I
could do this and get

640
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,290
this answer because of
that 90 degree angle.

641
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,220
If I didn't have
90 degrees, do you

642
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,890
see that this wouldn't work?

643
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:02,700
Suppose my two basis functions
are at some 40 degree angle.

644
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,150
Then I take my function.

645
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,270
Can I project that
onto this guy?

646
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:13,510
And project that onto this guy,
so the projections are there?

647
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,790
And there?

648
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:20,680
Do they add back to the
function that I started with?

649
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,190
The given function?

650
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,310
No way.

651
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:26,080
I mean, these are
much too big, right?

652
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,140
If I add that one to this one
I'm way out here somewhere.

653
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,290
But over here, with
90 degrees, these

654
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,950
are the two projections,
project there.

655
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,900
Project there.

656
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,260
Add those two pieces
and I got back exactly.

657
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:48,080
I just want to emphasize the
importance of orthogonality.

658
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,780
It breaks the problem down into
one-dimensional projections.

659
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,020
So here we go with b_k*sin(kx).

660
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,910
OK, let me do the
key example now.

661
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,800
This example.

662
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,030
Let me find the coefficients of
that particular function S(x).

663
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:13,140
This is the step function,
the square wave, S(x),

664
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,190
let's find its coefficients.

665
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,390
I'll just use this formula.

666
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:22,190
OK, maybe I'll erase so that
I can write the integration

667
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,480
right underneath.

668
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,030
OK.

669
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,650
Oh, one little point here.

670
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,320
Well, not so little,
but it's a saving.

671
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,520
It's worth noticing.

672
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,050
The reward for picking
off the odd function

673
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:45,380
is, I think that this integral
is the same from minus

674
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,350
pi to zero as zero to pi.

675
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:51,340
In other words, I think
that for an odd function,

676
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:57,260
I get the same answer if I
just do the integral from zero

677
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:03,280
to pi, that I have to do.

678
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,510
And double it.

679
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:10,790
So I think if I
just double it, I

680
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:14,820
don't know if you
regard that as a saving.

681
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,560
In some way, the work
is only half as much.

682
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,080
It'll make this
particular example easy,

683
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,560
so let me do this example.

684
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,230
What are the
Fourier coefficients

685
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:29,430
of the square wave?

686
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:34,730
OK, so I'll do this integral.

687
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:39,580
So from zero to pi,
what is my function?

688
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,710
My N from the graph?

689
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,630
Just one.

690
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,230
This is going to
be a picnic, right?

691
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:50,700
The function is one here.

692
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:58,960
So S(x) is one, so I want 2/pi,
the integral from zero to pi

693
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,240
of just sin(kx) dx, right?

694
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,790
Which is, so I've got 2/pi,
now I integrate sin(kx),

695
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:15,070
I get minus cos(kx), right?

696
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:18,900
Between zero and pi.

697
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,190
And what else?

698
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,200
What have I forgotten?

699
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,460
The most important point.

700
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,390
The integral of sin(kx)
is not minus cos(kx).

701
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:34,070
I have to divide by k.

702
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,760
It's the division by k
that's going to give me

703
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,530
the correct decay rate.

704
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,920
2/(pi*k).

705
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,460
Alright, now I've got a
little calculation to do.

706
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:50,070
I have to figure out what is
cos(kx) at zero, no problem,

707
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,310
it's one.

708
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:55,840
And at the other point, at x=pi.

709
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,060
So what am I getting, then?

710
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:01,620
I'm getting 2/pi-- no, 2/(pi*k).

711
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:09,860


712
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,200
With that minus sign,
I'll evaluate it at x=0,

713
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,550
I have one minus whatever
I get at the top.

714
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,440
cos(k*pi).

715
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,090
That's b_k.

716
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,820


717
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:32,970
So there's a typical, well not
typical but very nice, answer.

718
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,350
Now let's see what
these numbers are.

719
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:39,930
So let me take a 2/pi out here.

720
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:44,060
And then just list
these numbers.

721
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,090
So k is one, two, three,
four, five, right?

722
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:50,450
Tell me what these
numbers are for-- Let me

723
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:55,490
put the k in here because
that's part of it.

724
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,520
So it's a constant, 2/pi.

725
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,200
At k=1, what do I get?

726
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,850
At k=1?

727
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:09,970
This is the little bit
that needs the patience.

728
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:15,190
At k=1, the cosine of pi is?

729
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,850
Negative one.

730
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:20,270
So I have net minus
minus one, I get a two.

731
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:25,590
I get a two over
a one. k is one.

732
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:30,740
Alright, that is the
coefficient for k=1.

733
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,980
Now, what's b_2, the
coefficient for k=2?

734
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:39,140
I have 1-cos(2pi),
what's cos(2pi)?

735
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,060
One.

736
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,060
So they cancel, so I get a zero.

737
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,210
There is no b_2.

738
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,130
What about b_3?

739
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:51,870
So now b_3, I have 1-cos(3pi).

740
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,780
What's the cosine of 3pi?

741
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,490
It's negative one again.

742
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,680
Right, same as the cosine of pi.

743
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,300
So that gives me a two, and
now I'm dividing by three.

744
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,670
2/3.

745
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:08,400
Alright, let's do two
more. k=4, what do I get?

746
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,570
Zero, because the cosine of
4pi has come back to one.

747
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:13,780
So I get a zero.

748
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,520
And what do I get from k=5?

749
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,280


750
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:26,190
1-cos(5pi), which is? cos(5pi)
is back to negative one,

751
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:29,170
so one minus negative
one is a two.

752
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:31,610
You see the pattern.

753
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:40,930
And so let me just copy the
famous series for this S(x).

754
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:44,910
This S(x) is, let's see.

755
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:48,100
The twos, I'll make
that 4/pi, right?

756
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,090
I'll take out all those twos.

757
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:58,640
So I have 4/pi 1-cos(5pi), I
have no sin(2x), forget that.

758
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,750
Now I do have some sin(3x)'s,
how much do I have?

759
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,930
4/pi sin(3x)'s.

760
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:09,170


761
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:12,110
But divide by three, right?

762
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:16,000
And then there's no
4x's, no sin(4x)'s.

763
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,030
But then there will be a 4/pi
sine, what's the next term now?

764
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,360
Are you with me?

765
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,450
So this is a typical nice
example, an important example.

766
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,750
Sine of what?

767
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:33,960
5x, divided by five.

768
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,120
OK.

769
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,850
That's a great example,
it's worth remembering.

770
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,490
Factor the 4/pi
out if you want to.

771
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:46,110
4/pi times sin(x),
sine(3x)/3, sin(5x)/5,

772
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,790
it's a beautiful example
of an odd function.

773
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:53,820
OK, and let's see.

774
00:45:53,820 --> 00:46:00,930
So what do you think,
MATLAB can draw this graph

775
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,640
far better than we can.

776
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,170
But let me draw
enough so you see

777
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,790
what's really interesting here.

778
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,290
Interesting and famous.

779
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:15,810
So the leading term
is 4/pi sin(x), that

780
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:18,250
would be something like that.

781
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,860
That's as close
as sin(x) can get,

782
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,320
4/pi is the optimal number.

783
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,980
The optimal coefficient.

784
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,230
The projection.

785
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:32,150
This 4/pi*sin(x) is the best,
the closest I can get to one.

786
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,760
On that interval.

787
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,010
With just sin(x).

788
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,950
But now when I put
in sin(3x), I think

789
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:44,440
it'll do something
more like this.

790
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,860
Do you see what's
happening there?

791
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,130
That's what I've got with
sin(3x), and of course

792
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:50,670
odd on the other side.

793
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,790
What do you think it
looks like with sin(5x)?

794
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:59,540
It's just so great you have
to let the computer draw

795
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,720
it a couple of times.

796
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,310
You see, it goes up here.

797
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:08,000
And then it's sort of, you
know, it's getting closer.

798
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,460
It's going to stay
closer to that.

799
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,420
But I don't know if you
can see from my picture,

800
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,730
I'm actually proud
of that picture.

801
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,100
It's not as bad as usual.

802
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:27,190
And it makes the crucial
point, two crucial points.

803
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:31,090
One is, I am going to get
closer and closer to one.

804
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:38,510
These oscillations, these
ripples, will be smaller.

805
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,300
But here is the
great fact and it's

806
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:45,040
a big headache in calculation.

807
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:51,950
At the jump, the first
ripple doesn't get smaller.

808
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:57,150
The first ripple gets thinner,
the first ripple gets thinner.

809
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,340
You see the ripples
moving over there,

810
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,950
but their height doesn't change.

811
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:04,200
Do you know whose name
is associated with that,

812
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,980
in that phenomenon?

813
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,900
Gibbs.

814
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:14,950
Gibbs noticed that the
ripple height as you

815
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:18,030
add more and more terms,
you're closer and closer

816
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:23,430
to the function over more
and more of the interval.

817
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,950
So the ripples get
squeezed to the left.

818
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:29,560
The area under the ripples
goes to zero, certainly.

819
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,450
But the height of
the ripples doesn't.

820
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:36,015
And it doesn't stay constant,
but nearly constant.

821
00:48:36,015 --> 00:48:39,560
It approaches a famous number.

822
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,980
And of course we'll have the
same odd picture down here.

823
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,400
And it'll bump up
again, the same thing

824
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,810
is happening at every jump.

825
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,200
In other words, if
you're computing shock.

826
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,950
If you're computing
air flow around shocks,

827
00:48:54,950 --> 00:49:00,190
with Fourier-type methods,
Gibbs is going to get you.

828
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,300
You'll have to deal with Gibbs.

829
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:09,060
Because the shock has
that extra ripple.

830
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,980
OK, that's a lot of Section 4.1.

831
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,010
Energy, we didn't
get to, so that'll

832
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,440
be the first point on Friday.

833
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,430
And I'll see you this afternoon
and talk about the MATLAB

834
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:21,610
or anything else.

835
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,860
OK.
