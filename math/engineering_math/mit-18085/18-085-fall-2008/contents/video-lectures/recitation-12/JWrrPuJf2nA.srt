9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,370
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, so review
session on the first part

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,900
of the Fourier chapter, these
two topics that we've done

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,400
and that homework
is now coming on.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,960
Fourier series, the
classical facts.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,760
Plus, paying
attention to the rate

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,570
of decay of the
Fourier coefficients,

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,310
it's an aspect not
always mentioned.

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,400
And the energy
equality is important.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,570
So it's not just here's the
function, find the coefficient.

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:02,480
That's part of it
but not all of it.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,800
And then the discrete
series we were doing today.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,120
OK, so those are the
two topics for today,

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,580
and then the next
review session,

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,140
which would be two
weeks from now,

23
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,470
would focus especially on
convolution and Fourier

24
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,680
integrals.

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,140
OK, so I'm open to
questions on the homework,

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,260
or off the homework.

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,150
Always fine.

28
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,460
I didn't know how many questions
to ask you on the homework.

29
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,410
I wanted you to have enough
practice doing this stuff

30
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,120
because the time for this
Fourier part of the course

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,710
is a little shorter.

32
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:54,740
Thanksgiving comes into it,
so needed to do some exercise.

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,210
And you've got a good question.

34
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:56,710
Thanks.

35
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

36
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,510
PROFESSOR STRANG: Number
18 on the homework, OK.

37
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,860
Ah yes, OK.

38
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,300
Right, alright.

39
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,490
So the idea of that
problem, I'm really

40
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,860
asking you to read the
two pages, the last two

41
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,490
pages of the section.

42
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,480
That use Fourier series to
solve the heat equation.

43
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,840
So we've used,
briefly, Fourier series

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,110
to solve Laplace's equation.

45
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,380
So that was, just to recall.

46
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,210
So Fourier series to
solve Laplace's equation

47
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,370
was when the region
was a circle.

48
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,330
The function was given, the
boundary values were given.

49
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,860
It's 2pi periodic
because it is a circle.

50
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,140
And we solved Laplace inside.

51
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,510
Because on the boundary,
the perfect thing we needed

52
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,980
was the Fourier series
to match the boundary.

53
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,630
Now, I'm taking another,
classical, classical

54
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,230
application too.

55
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,590
The heat equation.

56
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,100
So I made it heat equation.

57
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,210
So this direction is time,
this direction is space.

58
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:23,230
The heat equation is
u_t=u_xx, if the coefficient--

59
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,220
Everybody here knows there
would be a c in there,

60
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,080
but let's take it to be one.

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,560
Then what are the solutions,
and how does a Fourier series

62
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,150
help you to match the
initial functions?

63
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:43,450
So I'm matching, I'm
given u(x,0) here.

64
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,630
OK.

65
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,070
Along this is at time zero.

66
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,210
So that says at a time
zero, so I have a bar.

67
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,440
I have a conducting bar.

68
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,790
And this is such a
classical example

69
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,410
that I didn't feel you
could miss it completely.

70
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,810
Even though we look
beyond formulas.

71
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,320
But here's one where the formula
shows us something important.

72
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,520
OK, so what are solutions
to this equation?

73
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,700
You look for solutions,
so the classical idea

74
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,880
of separate variables.

75
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,670
Look for solutions that are of
the form some function of t,

76
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,760
maybe I'll try to use the
same letters as the text.

77
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,090
Some function of t, times
some function of x, OK?

78
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:43,600
And the text uses, look for
solutions u(x,t) that are

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,340
of this form.

80
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,460
Some function of t,
and I didn't remember.

81
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,450
Ah yes, it's A(x)B(t).

82
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,450
OK, that's what I
mean by separating.

83
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,470
So those will be especially
simple solutions.

84
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,770
And when we go to match
the initial condition,

85
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,840
I'll just plug in t=0
and I'll see the A(x)'s.

86
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,280
Well, what are they?

87
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,260
In this case, so their
eigenfunction-- oh,

88
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,020
I have to tell you about the
remaining boundary conditions,

89
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,885
don't I?

90
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:24,590
Because that will decide
what the A(x) has to satisfy,

91
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,540
and will decide what
those eigenfunctions are.

92
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,770
So, let's see.

93
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,970
In this problem I think
I picked free conditions.

94
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,210
So I made the interval minus
pi to pi, that's a change.

95
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,690
Minus pi to pi just so we
have nice Fourier series.

96
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:54,140
And here I have this boundary
is free, du/dx, u', at x=-pi,

97
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,160
for all time, so up
this line, is zero.

98
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,830
And also u' at plus pi,
and all time is zero.

99
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,810
So up those lines,
heat's going out.

100
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,110
That's what that means.

101
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,940
Is that what that means, or does
that mean heat can't go out?

102
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,050
No, so what's happening?

103
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,370
Heat's not going out.

104
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,640
Is that right?

105
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,460
The slope is zero, right?

106
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,812
The slope is the
temperature gradient,

107
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:27,520
we're requiring the
temperature gradient.

108
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,580
So the ends of the
bar are insulated.

109
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,390
So this is insulated.

110
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,790
No passage through, right?

111
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,940
Is that what that means?

112
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,780
Yeah.

113
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:43,300
It's like there's nobody,
it's cut off there.

114
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,170
The rod isn't extended
for heat to go further.

115
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:55,160
OK, so that tells us
what the x and the t,

116
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,230
what the A(x) and B(t) are.

117
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,810
So here's the point.

118
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:04,000
You plug that hoped-for solution
into the equation, right?

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,210
So I plug it in here.

120
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,310
What do I have on the left
side, just the time derivative?

121
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:16,260
So that's A times-- A(x)
B'(t), you see taking the time

122
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,900
derivative doesn't touch A(x).

123
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,130
On the right-hand side,
I don't touch B(t),

124
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:27,970
but I have a second
derivative of the x part.

125
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,470
So far, so good.

126
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,090
Now, a little trick.

127
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,080
If I divide both
sides by A and by B,

128
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:48,250
I get B'/B equaling
A''/A. Right?

129
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,160
Just, put the A under
here, put the B under here.

130
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,470
Now what?

131
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,390
This is neat, because
that function is only

132
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,320
depending on time.

133
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,770
This function depends only on
x, so that the both sides have

134
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,900
to be constant.

135
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,890
One can't actually change with
time, because this side is not

136
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,410
changing with time.

137
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,080
And this couldn't
actually change

138
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,590
with x, because that's
not changing with x.

139
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,030
So those are both constants.

140
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,810
So both constants.

141
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,090
Let's see, I'll maybe
just put a constant.

142
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,050
And various constants
are possible.

143
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,670
OK, so now you see
the point here.

144
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,580
Now I have two
separate equations,

145
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,630
I have an equation for
the B part, dB/dt, B'.

146
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,920
If I bring the B up
there, I have equals,

147
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,330
the constant times B. And I
know the solution to that.

148
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,730
B(t) is, as everybody
knows, what's

149
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,180
the solution to a first order
constant coefficient equation?

150
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,540
Just e^(ct)*B(0).

151
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,480


152
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,140
Good, we've got B. We've
got a B(t) that works,

153
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,820
and now what's the
A that also works?

154
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,200
That has A''.

155
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,940
And I bring the A up, so now I
have A''=cA, so the A that goes

156
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,450
with it is?

157
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:32,540
Oh, OK, I've used a c
there, so what's the good?

158
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,970
I want-- Two derivatives
should bring down a c.

159
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:42,100
Let me change c to
minus lambda squared.

160
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,640
How about if I look ahead,
change this constant to minus

161
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,430
lambda squared, because
I want something

162
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,840
where two derivatives bring
down minus lambda squared,

163
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,750
and what will do that?

164
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,720
Any amount of
cos(lambda*x), right?

165
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,530
Because two derivatives will
bring down a minus lambda

166
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,230
squared.

167
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,980
And any amount of sin(lambda*x).

168
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:18,480
And this is now e to the
minus lambda squared t.

169
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,300
I'm doing this fast, but
actually it's totally simple.

170
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,400
The conclusion is that I now
have a bunch of solutions

171
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,880
of this special separated form.

172
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,470
Where B(t) could be that and
A(x) could be either of those

173
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,690
or any combination of those.

174
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,910
And I have to use the
same lambda for each,

175
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:46,110
so that the two equations will
work in the original problem.

176
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,500
Good.

177
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,080
Now, so far, no
boundary conditions.

178
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,650
What I've got so far is
just a lot of solutions.

179
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,740
These times that.

180
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,390
With any lambda.

181
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,580
But of course the
boundary conditions

182
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,060
will tell me the
lambdas, first of all.

183
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,970
And how do they tell me?

184
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,810
The only boundary condition
I have is this free stuff.

185
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:14,640
So it's free, the slope should
be zero at pi, and zero at?

186
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,980
So that's the x direction.

187
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,710
So that's going to tell
me-- I've forgotten.

188
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,240
Do I want cosines or sines?

189
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,640
Cosines.

190
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,990
I want the derivative
to be zero at pi.

191
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,910
Yeah, so I think I
want cosines, good.

192
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,690
And then lambdas can't
be anything at all.

193
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:41,570
Because, should lambda be an
integer or something like that?

194
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,850
I think maybe lambda
should be an integer,

195
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,090
because I want to plug in pi.

196
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,560
So let me take the
second derivative.

197
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,670
Is minus lambda
squared cos(lambda*x).

198
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,910
And then I want to plug in x=pi.

199
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:04,910
And I want this to be zero.

200
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:10,010
So lambda should be an
integer, is that right?

201
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,900
At multiples of pi, the
cosine is zero, yes.

202
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,270
Is it?

203
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,070
No.

204
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,150
Did I want sine?

205
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,800
Maybe I wanted sine.

206
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,590
Oh, it's the first derivative
I'm looking at, thank you.

207
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,300
Thank you.

208
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,740
OK, good.

209
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,580
OK, now I've got it.

210
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,410
Thank you.

211
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,120
And now I see lambda
should be an integer.

212
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,090
Lambda should be, zero
is, yeah zero's alright.

213
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,150
That's the constant
term, yeah, we need that.

214
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,320
Zero, one, two, and so on.

215
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,480
So do you see that
I've now got, now I

216
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,860
can take-- I've got
a lot of solutions,

217
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,510
and I have a linear problem.

218
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,170
So I can take any combination.

219
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:05,140
So finally I have final
solution is that u(x,t) is any

220
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:12,690
combination, with coefficients
I'm free to choose, of A(x),

221
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:18,570
which is cos(nx), because
lambda had to be an n.

222
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,700
And n could be anywhere
from zero on up.

223
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:31,070
Times e to the minus, lambda
is n, so that's n squared t.

224
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,150
Did I get that?

225
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,970
Let me draw a circle
and step back.

226
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,620
What's up?

227
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

228
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,280
PROFESSOR STRANG: I
could have negative n's,

229
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,820
they wouldn't give me
anything new, right?

230
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,510
I mean cos(nx) and
cos(-nx) are just,

231
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,070
one's just the
negative of the other.

232
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,040
So these are the good guys.

233
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,360
I've got a cosine series because
I've got free n's, right.

234
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,570
Because of the
boundary conditions.

235
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,300
Do you see that?

236
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,970
That's pretty nice.

237
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,770
There's my A(x),
there's my B(t),

238
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,090
I can take any combination.

239
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,600
Usual stuff.

240
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,530
You get to that solution.

241
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,950
OK, and now I have to meet
the initial conditions, right?

242
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,990
Boundary conditions
are now built-in

243
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,220
because I chose cosine.

244
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,270
Or you did.

245
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:30,810
Now, this will tell
me what the c's are.

246
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,030
I'm going to set t=0.

247
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:38,380
At t=0, I'm given the
initial condition, u(x,0),

248
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,440
and I have the same
sum of c_n*cos(nx)*e^0.

249
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,460


250
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,330
So this will tell me the c's
are the cosine coefficients

251
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,850
of the given initial conditions.

252
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,890
So I expand, so here's where
Fourier series has paid off.

253
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,620
Expand the initial function
in a cosine series.

254
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,550
And then go forward in time.

255
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,360
This is just the
old e^(lambda*t).

256
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,130


257
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,300
Only the lambda we're talking
about here is minus n squared.

258
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,260
And you see what's
happening here?

259
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,260
What's going to
happen for large time?

260
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,780
So this is a very
physical problem.

261
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,220
That I think you cannot take
18.085 without seeing this

262
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,600
problem.

263
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,430
You can't learn
about Fourier series

264
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:36,410
without using it for
the initial value.

265
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,610
And then propagating in time
with the usual exponentials

266
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,150
for each one.

267
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,690
And now as n increases
what do I see?

268
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,710
Faster and faster decay.

269
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:54,040
For large n, these are going
to zero extremely fast.

270
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:00,090
So that what you see
with a solid bar, which

271
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:07,830
starts with the temperature
u in some-- Oh, probably

272
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,400
not negative unless
it's a really cold bar.

273
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:16,410
But, anyway, it starts with
some initial temperature.

274
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,880
That flattens out fast.

275
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,990
The heat flows, to equilibrate.

276
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,010
What I approach is the
constant term, c_0.

277
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,330
This approaches c_0.

278
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:33,920
Because all these other n
positives, they go to zero.

279
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,690
So the heat distributes
itself equally.

280
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:43,570
OK, and now I guess the
particular u(0) in the problem

281
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,430
was a delta.

282
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:52,470
OK, and so the
particular u(0) was all,

283
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:58,610
was from that really hot point.

284
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,620
So we know the coefficients.

285
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,910
We know the cosine coefficients
for the delta function,

286
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,240
we know these c's,
and what were they?

287
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,530
1/(2pi) was c_0.

288
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,740
And the other c's
were 1/pi, I think.

289
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,320
Is that right?

290
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,120
Maybe they're all 1/(2pi).

291
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,030
Maybe.

292
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,970
Yeah.

293
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,140
Whatever.

294
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,500
They disappear fast.

295
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,210
And this is what we approach.

296
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,230
So the heat from the
delta function is, yeah.

297
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:37,030
So is that everything
the problem wanted?

298
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,530
Yeah.

299
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,690
Yeah.

300
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,560
I think we've done it.

301
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,680
We'll put in the c_n's
to complete that picture.

302
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,350
Into here.

303
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,480
And then c_0 is the one
that survives over time.

304
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,820
Yeah.

305
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,800
I guess you've, once I got
rolling I couldn't stop

306
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,870
and that's u.

307
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,630
For investing time
this afternoon

308
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:10,350
you get a fast look at this
classical, classical problem

309
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,600
of separating the variables
using the Fourier series

310
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,350
for the initial function.

311
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:24,190
And recognizing that we're
doing this on a finite interval.

312
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:31,670
If the bar was
infinitely long, then we

313
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,410
would be talking about
Fourier integrals.

314
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,890
And that's what's
coming up a bit later.

315
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,320
We would integrate
instead of sum.

316
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,900
Yeah.

317
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,380
But the idea would
not be different,

318
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,720
if we had infinite
bar then we would not

319
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,150
be restricted to n
equals zero, one, two,

320
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,610
three; any n, any
cosine, wouldn't

321
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,440
have to be an integer at all.

322
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,360
Any number, any frequency
would be allowed.

323
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,780
And so we would have to
integrate that, yeah.

324
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:08,330
And that's a classical
problem too, again.

325
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,210
It's come up in a modern way,
that the famous Black-Scholes

326
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,460
equation.

327
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,200
So.

328
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,480
The heat equation is for 18.086.

329
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,490
Here, we brought it up because
we could solve it fast.

330
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,990
But the actual, yeah.

331
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,290
The most important
solution I could give you

332
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,170
to the heat equation would
be the one that starts

333
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,650
from that point source of heat.

334
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,730
But on the whole line.

335
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,770
The one that would be
integrals instead of sums.

336
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,850
Yeah.

337
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,320
So we came pretty close to
solving the most important heat

338
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,330
equation problem.

339
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,170
But we're doing the periodic
case, with just cosines,

340
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:05,050
and the infinite line case
would be the most famous of all.

341
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,550
Yeah.

342
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,820
And it has a
beautiful form, and I

343
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,190
was going to say that the heat
equation's pretty classical.

344
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:22,660
But let's see, where can I write
the magic words, Black-Scholes.

345
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,860
Next to the heat equation,
so that's the heat equation

346
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:36,880
but it's also-- do you know
these names, Black and Scholes?

347
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,180
Anybody in Mathematics
of Finance?

348
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:47,030
So these much-despised
option, derivative options,

349
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,760
so people on Wall
Street, traders,

350
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,560
will carry around a
little calculator that

351
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,720
solves the
Black-Scholes equation

352
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,820
so they can price the
options that they're

353
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,780
bidding to buy and sell, so
they can price them fast.

354
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,480
And that little calculator
does a finite differences,

355
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,650
or a Fourier series solution
to this Black-Scholes equation,

356
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,880
which actually, if you
change variables on it,

357
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,610
is the heat equation.

358
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,540
So what you see
here as is actually

359
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,210
important on Wall Street
except, it's probably not

360
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,650
the right moment to mention it.

361
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:34,010
Right?

362
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,180
So you can blame the whole
meltdown on mathematicians.

363
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,900
But that wouldn't
be entirely fair.

364
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,820
They didn't mean it, anyway.

365
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,940
But that's been the biggest
source of employment,

366
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:55,340
I guess, apart from teaching,
in the last ten years.

367
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,480
People who could work out
the partial differential

368
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,070
equations, and they get more
complicated than the heat

369
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,630
equation, you can be sure.

370
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:09,650
And so the classical
one, these guys

371
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,620
are economists at MIT and
Harvard, or they were.

372
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,590
And I guess maybe the
Nobel Prize in Economics

373
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,420
came to part of that group.

374
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,290
And also to Merton.

375
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,750
Maybe Black, possibly
Black died before the time

376
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,210
of the Nobel Prize.

377
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,690
Anyway, they were the first.

378
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,930
And it's a beautiful
paper, beautiful paper too.

379
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,850
Just to figure out
how do you price

380
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,410
the, what's the value
of an option to buy,

381
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,250
that allows you to buy or
sell a stock at a later time?

382
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,160
Yeah.

383
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,770
So it's, well of course you
have to make assumptions

384
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,560
on what's going to
happen over that time

385
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,620
and that's where Wall Street
came to grief, I guess.

386
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:08,160
If you had to put
it in a nutshell,

387
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,020
I mean, the options, the
standard straightforward

388
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,790
options, those are fine.

389
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,510
Using Black-Scholes,
and then what's happened

390
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:21,760
is they now price more and
more complicated things.

391
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,100
To the point that the banks
were buying and selling

392
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:32,030
credit default swaps, insurance
swaps, that practically nobody

393
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,950
understood what they were.

394
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,190
They just assumed that if there
was always a market for them,

395
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,360
like insurance, somehow
it wouldn't happen.

396
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,060
And you get on.

397
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,370
But it happened.

398
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,290
So, now we're in trouble.

399
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,560
OK, that's not
18.085, fortunately.

400
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,280
Or math, but.

401
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,320
Anyway, a lot of people
got involved with things

402
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,050
they didn't really know about.

403
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:07,280
And then were selling them as
well as of course the mortgage

404
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,840
problems.

405
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,650
Anyway.

406
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:20,250
Ready for other questions on
our homework, or these topics.

407
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,710
Yeah.

408
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,230
OK.

409
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,837
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

410
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,670
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK

411
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

412
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:35,230
PROFESSOR STRANG:
OK, right, yeah.

413
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,100
Have an image of waves, so --

414
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

415
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,600
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

416
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,390
I suppose if I had to have a
picture of the discrete thing,

417
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:50,250
if my picture of
the function case

418
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,950
was a bunch of
sines, and cosines,

419
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,090
somehow adding up
to my function.

420
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:01,380
And if time, if I'm
solving the heat equation

421
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:09,030
then those separate waves
are maybe decaying in time.

422
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,920
Here.

423
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,220
So that when I add
them up at a later time

424
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,530
I get something different.

425
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:18,420
Or if it was the wave equation,
which is probably your image,

426
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,510
they're moving in time.

427
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,780
So they add up to different
things at different times,

428
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,120
because they can move
at different speeds.

429
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,870
Yes, so a function is
a sum of waves, right?

430
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,520
Then what would the
discrete guy be?

431
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,640
I guess I would just have to
imagine the function as only

432
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,130
having those n values.

433
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,750
And my wave would
just be, a wave

434
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:51,200
might be just n values there.

435
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,630
But still, if I have a
time-dependent problem,

436
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,050
maybe that thing is
pulsing up and down.

437
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:05,400
It's just that it's only got
a fixed number of points.

438
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,230
And I'm not looking at
the whole wave on a, yeah.

439
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:15,270
But I don't think it's
essentially different.

440
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,090
And of course, the fast Fourier
transform and the discrete case

441
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:23,360
is used to approximate
the continuous one.

442
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,880
Yeah.

443
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,700
You can look in
Numerical Recipes

444
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,080
for a discussion of
approximating the Fourier

445
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,300
series by discrete
Fourier series.

446
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,910
I mean, that's an
important question.

447
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,930
Because of course,
Fourier series

448
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,270
has got all these integrals.

449
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:46,650
The coefficients come
from an integral formula.

450
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,300
We're not going to do
those integrals exactly,

451
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,000
so we have to do them
some approximate way.

452
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,220
And one way would be to
use equally spaced points

453
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,820
and do the DFT.

454
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,360
Can you just remind me what
that integral formula is?

455
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,600
I don't want you to, it
was on the board today.

456
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,840
What's the formula for the
coefficient c_k in the Fourier

457
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,640
series.

458
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,810
I'm really just asking
you this because I

459
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:24,410
think you should have
it in some memory cache,

460
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,830
you know in fast memory,
rather than in the textbook.

461
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,630
OK, so what's the
formula for c_k,

462
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,250
in the Fourier series case?

463
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,910
Everybody think about it.

464
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,130
It's going to be
an integral, right?

465
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,730
And I'll take it over
zero to 2pi, I don't mind.

466
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,650
Or minus pi, pi.

467
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,160
And what do I integrate?

468
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,760
This is the Fourier coefficients
of the function f(x)?

469
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,180
So I take f(x), I
remember to divide by 2pi,

470
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,050
I'm doing the continuous
one, what do I multiply by

471
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,340
to get the coefficients?

472
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,220
e^(-ikx).

473
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:12,350


474
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:16,030
So I've forgotten
whether I assigned some

475
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:19,000
of these very early questions.

476
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,740
It just gave you the
function and said

477
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,440
what's the coefficient.

478
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,590
If I just look at one or two.

479
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,400
Suppose my function is f(x)=x.

480
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,940
I guess in that
problem, in Problem 1,

481
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,700
I made it minus pi to pi.

482
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,420
Suppose f(x)=x.

483
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:40,220


484
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,740
So you have to integrate
x times e^(-ikx).

485
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,150


486
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,780
Well, you got an integral to do.

487
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:55,920
OK, it's doable but
not instantly doable.

488
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,890
Let me ask you some questions
and you tell me about it.

489
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,530
So I draw the function.

490
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,040
The function is x
from minus pi to pi.

491
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,330
And tell me about
the coefficients,

492
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:13,860
how quickly do they decay?

493
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,790
This is like some constant
over k to some power p,

494
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,450
and what's p?

495
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,620
What rate of decay are you
expecting for the coefficients?

496
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,910
Well you say to yourself,
it looks like a pretty nice

497
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,950
function, smooth as can be.

498
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,500
But, what's the answer here?

499
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:43,100
The rate of decay will be,
what will that power be?

500
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,530
One.

501
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:49,090
Because the function jumps.

502
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:53,630
The function has a jump there,
and the Fourier coefficients

503
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,170
have got to deal with it.

504
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,980
So the Fourier series
for this is going to be,

505
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,550
if I took 100 terms it
would be really close.

506
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:09,240
And then it'll go down here to
the, but it's got to get there.

507
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,060
And got to start, and
pick up below there.

508
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,870
So it's got the same issue,
the Gibbs phenomenon,

509
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,440
that the square wave had.

510
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,550
It's got that jump.

511
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:26,780
So it'll go like 1/k.

512
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,660
OK, coming back.

513
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,650
Could you actually
find those numbers?

514
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,750
And do you remember how
to do integral like that?

515
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,710
Well, look it up, I
guess is the best answer.

516
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:43,830
But whoever did it
the first time, well,

517
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,490
it's integration
by parts, somehow.

518
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,640
The derivative of this
makes it real simple,

519
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,800
and this we can integrate
really easily, right?

520
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,810
So we integrate that, take
the derivative of that.

521
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:02,280
We get a boundary term,
so I don't exactly

522
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,830
remember the formula.

523
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:09,960
But it'll have a couple
of terms, but not bad.

524
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,230
And we'll see this 1/k.

525
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,930
OK, and that's the formula.

526
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:21,180
If I changed x to
something else, let's see.

527
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,760
As long as I'm looking at
number one, what if I took e^x?

528
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,660
Oh, easy.

529
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:31,900
Right? e^x, yeah, let's do e^x,
because that's an easy one.

530
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,580
Now, e^x looks like, so
what's my graph of e^x?

531
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:42,490
It's quite small here at minus
pi, and pretty large at e^pi.

532
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,750
What's the rate of
decay of the Fourier

533
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,830
coefficients for that guy?

534
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,200
Same.

535
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,960
Got to jump again.

536
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,930
Drops down here.

537
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,580
So let's find it.

538
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,340
Let's find those
Fourier, that integral.

539
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,040
That's e^(x-ik).

540
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,520
Sorry, let's put down
what I'm integrating here.

541
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:13,560
I'm integrating e to
the x times (1-ik).

542
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,230
Right?

543
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,970
That's what I've
got to integrate.

544
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,460
The integral is the same
thing divided by 1-ik.

545
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,980


546
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,711
I plug in the endpoints,
minus pi and pi,

547
00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:29,710
and I've got the answer.

548
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,890
And I divide by 2pi.

549
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,500


550
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,000
Yeah.

551
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So that's a totally doable one.

552
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,221
Let's plug it in.

553
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:37,720
1/(2pi).

554
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,470


555
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:45,460
And then the denominator is
this 1-ik, yeah, well there you

556
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,630
see it already, right?

557
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:51,860
You see already the
1/k in the denominator.

558
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,760
That's giving us
the slow decay rate.

559
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:00,190
And now I'm plugging
in equal-- equal--

560
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,880
e^(pi(1-ik)) minus
e^(-pi(1-ik)).

561
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:10,590


562
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:21,910
So as k gets big,
this is slow decay.

563
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:24,370
Now, what's happening
here as k gets large?

564
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,890
Oh, k is multiplied by i there.

565
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,830
So this e^(pi*ik)
is just sitting,

566
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,210
it may even be just one or
something, or minus one,

567
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:36,820
or whatever.

568
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,900
Is it?

569
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,290
Yeah. k is just an
integer, this is k*pi*i,

570
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,440
that's just minus
one to something.

571
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,280
So all that numerator
is minus one

572
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:52,460
to the to the k-th
power or something.

573
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,480
Times e^pi.

574
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:05,010
So e^pi is there. e^(-ik) at--
e^(-i*pi*k) is just minus one.

575
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:10,750
And this is maybe e to the minus
pi times the same, e^(+i*pi*k).

576
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,100


577
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,160
I think that's
minus one to the k.

578
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,760
Well, wait a minute.

579
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,020
Maybe they're not
both, whatever.

580
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,500
It's a number.

581
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,550
It's a number.

582
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,090
That's just of this size.

583
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:31,580
There's the big number,
there's the small one.

584
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:37,440
And divided by that,
that's the thing that shows

585
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,920
is yes, there is this jump.

586
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,330
Right?

587
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:45,920
OK, that's a couple of sets
of Fourier coefficients.

588
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,280
You could ask yourself,
because on the quiz

589
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,360
there'll probably
be one, and I'll

590
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,490
try to pick a function
that's interesting.

591
00:34:54,490 --> 00:35:00,640
And I mean, I don't plan
to pick xe^x or anything.

592
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,690
Yeah.

593
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,120
OK, good.

594
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,970
Yes, thanks.

595
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:11,167
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Fourier series

596
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:13,250
has twice the energy as
another, what's that mean?

597
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:13,680
PROFESSOR STRANG: I don't know.

598
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,670
I guess.

599
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,630
Hm.

600
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,050
Maybe we're talking
about power, and things

601
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:29,010
like if we were dealing
with electronics,

602
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,860
I guess I would interpret
that energy in terms of power.

603
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,860
So that's what I'd be seeing.

604
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,660
I'm not thinking of
a really good answer

605
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,070
to say well, why is
that energy equality,

606
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,950
but it's really useful.

607
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,700
You know, so much of
signal processing,

608
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,880
and we'll do a bit
of signal processing,

609
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,920
is simply based on
that energy equality

610
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,170
there, and the moving
into frequency space.

611
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,940
And convolution.

612
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,320
Actually, they would
call it filtering.

613
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,780
So we'll call it filtering
when we use convolution.

614
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,640
But it's pure convolution.

615
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:22,710
Pure linear algebra,
for these special bases.

616
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,350
So, OK.

617
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:29,670
I could try to come up with a
better answer, or more focused

618
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:42,650
answer than just to say power
or, to use an electric power

619
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,300
word is just one step.

620
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,901
Yeah, thanks.

621
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:48,400
Yes.

622
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

623
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,180
PROFESSOR STRANG:
4.3, eight or nine.

624
00:36:53,180 --> 00:37:00,330
Let's just have a look and
see what they're about.

625
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,220
OK, just some regular guys.

626
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:07,910
Yeah so that, OK,
let me look at,

627
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:12,180
you want me to do 4.3 eight?

628
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:19,597
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

629
00:37:19,597 --> 00:37:20,680
PROFESSOR STRANG: Ah, yes.

630
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,190
Good, good question.

631
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,370
OK, so 4.3 eight gave
a couple of vectors,

632
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,080
a little bit like the
ones I did this morning.

633
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,490
I mean here the c in 4.3
eight has a couple of ones,

634
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:35,560
and this morning I just
had a [1, 0, 0, 0].

635
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,210
But no big deal.

636
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,850
Now, yeah.

637
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:44,950
So if two vectors
are orthogonal,

638
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:49,990
are their transforms orthogonal?

639
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,810
I think, yes.

640
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:52,940
Yes.

641
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,950
The Fourier, so the, yeah.

642
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,380
So maybe this is
worth a moment, here.

643
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,560
Yeah.

644
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,370
Because what do we,
let me write down

645
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:09,890
the letters for my question,
and then answer the question.

646
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:18,960
OK, so suppose I have
two vectors, c and d.

647
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,550
And they're orthogonal.

648
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,430
And then I want to
ask about their,

649
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:33,670
if I multiply by the Fourier
matrices, are those orthogonal?

650
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,840
That's sort of the question.

651
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,380
So here the vectors
in frequency space,

652
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,120
here they are in physical space.

653
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,550
I don't mind if you
started in physical space

654
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:47,680
and went to frequency with
F inverse, same question.

655
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,430
Does the Fourier
matrix preserve angles?

656
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,360
Does it preserve angles?

657
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:01,580
Do matrices, and F
wouldn't be the only one

658
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:06,590
with this property, do--
They preserve length, right?

659
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,980
If you preserve length, do
you preserve angles too?

660
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,520
Preserve length, you're
just looking at one vector.

661
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,650
We know that we preserve
length, and how do we know that?

662
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,460
Let's just remember that.

663
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,140
So here's the length question.

664
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,030
And this'll be the
angle question.

665
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,940
So this is the
energy inequality,

666
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,500
coming back to that key thing.

667
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:37,080
This is c bar transpose c,
and over here we have (Fc,Fc)

668
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,030
and this is what I
did this morning.

669
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:46,330
So that's c bar transpose
F bar transpose F c, right?

670
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:51,010
That's, why the bar as
well as the transpose?

671
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,450
Because we're doing complex.

672
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:59,600
OK, let me make a
little more space.

673
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,920
And what did we do this morning?

674
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,700
We replaced that by, well I
wish it were the identity.

675
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,670
But it's a multiple of the
identity, that's what matters.

676
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:17,620
So this was N, this is
the identity with an N,

677
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,500
c bar transpose c.

678
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:25,290
So the conclusion was that
this thing is just N times

679
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,500
this thing.

680
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,040
Well, and times this one.

681
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,460
I'm expecting oh, but
over here we got a zero.

682
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,780
So my N is going to wash out.

683
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,970
OK, let's just do the
same thing for angle.

684
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:46,020
This is the key energy
equality for length.

685
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:51,770
And all I want to say
is, this Fourier matrix,

686
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:57,230
like other orthogonal matrices,
is just rotating the space.

687
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,130
It's sort of
amazing to think you

688
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:05,340
have one space, physical
space, and you rotate it.

689
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,300
I'll use that word.

690
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,160
Because somehow that's what
an orthogonal matrix does.

691
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,210
Well it's complex
N-dimensional space.

692
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:18,860
Sorry, so it's not so easy to
visualize rotations in C^N,

693
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,020
but it's a rotation.

694
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,350
Angles don't change,
and let's just see why?

695
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,100
The inner product
of this with this

696
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,920
is c bar transpose,
F bar transpose,

697
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,590
because I have to
transpose that.

698
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:36,960
Times Fd, what do I do now?

699
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,790
This one was c bar
transpose d, with zero.

700
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,980
You see you have it?

701
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,210
Again, this fact that
this rotation and inverse,

702
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:56,090
and the transpose is the
identity, apart from an N. So

703
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,300
again, inner products
are multiplied

704
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,750
by N. Not only the
length squared,

705
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,070
which is inner
product with itself,

706
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,480
but all inner products
are just multiplied by N.

707
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,500
So if they start zero
they end up zero.

708
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,340
Yeah.

709
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,980
That was your question, right?

710
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,540
Yep, right.

711
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,860
So if I have a
couple of vectors,

712
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,100
as I guess that
problem proposed,

713
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,700
it happened to propose
two inputs that

714
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,290
happen to be
orthogonal, then you

715
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,460
should be able to see that
the transforms are, too.

716
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,300
Yeah.

717
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,950
Yep.

718
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:37,660
Can I ask you about question
two, was that on the homework?

719
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,470
Problem two in Section 4.3?

720
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,950
Was it?

721
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:49,880
All I want to say is
that's a simple fact.

722
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,200
Let me just write that fact down
so we're looking at that fact.

723
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:01,750
If I look at this F
matrix, it's so simple

724
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,790
but it leads to lots of
good, it's just a key fact.

725
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:12,690
But if I look at my F matrix,
am I looking at rows here?

726
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,351
Yeah, I happened
to look at rows,

727
00:43:14,351 --> 00:43:16,100
columns would be the
same, it's symmetric.

728
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:23,520
So here's row one, here's row
two, I'm sorry that's row zero.

729
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,830
This is row one.

730
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,850
And let me look at row N-1.

731
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:38,700
This is w, w^(N-1), this
was w^2, this is w^(2(N-1)).

732
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,070
And so on.

733
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,910
Everybody's got
the idea of the--

734
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:48,110
And then all these in-between
rows, two, three, et cetera.

735
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:55,580
And the question asks,
show that this and this

736
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,640
are complex conjugates.

737
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:03,590
That that row and that row are
the same, except conjugates.

738
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:08,430
So if we look at the
row number one in F,

739
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:14,040
we'll be looking at row
number N-1 in F bar.

740
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,920
Now, why is that row the
conjugate of that row?

741
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,320
Why is this the
conjugate of this?

742
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:23,940
Why are those two conjugates?

743
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:29,690
So I'm asking you to explain
to me why w bar is the, why

744
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:40,180
is the conjugate of this, this?

745
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:46,410
So it's just one more neat fact
about these important, crucial,

746
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,000
numbers w.

747
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,460
And so how do I see this?

748
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,650
Well, this is w-- This
is one way to do it.

749
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,990
This is w^N times w^(-1).

750
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,590
And what's w^N?

751
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:01,140
One.

752
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,640
Everybody knows, w^N is one.

753
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,650
So I have w, so I'm
trying to show that.

754
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:12,910
Well, we know that this is true.

755
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:18,240
So we know that the
conjugate of w, right?

756
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,450
There's w.

757
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:25,770
Here's its conjugate, and
it's also the inverse.

758
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:31,100
This w is some e^(i*theta),
this is some e to the the i some

759
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,470
angle.

760
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:35,450
Then always, it's sitting
on the unit circle.

761
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:40,840
So its reciprocal is
also on the unit circle.

762
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:46,780
The reciprocal has e^(-i*theta),
so it's just the conjugate.

763
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,090
That's a great fact.

764
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:54,810
That's a beautiful fact
about all these w's.

765
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:55,740
And their powers.

766
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,020
Conjugate and inverse the same.

767
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,450
Right.

768
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:04,630
So that was the
key to problem two.

769
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:08,250
I don't think I asked
you to go through all

770
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:12,070
the steps of problem
three, but just in case

771
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,580
you didn't read problem
three, let me tell you

772
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,410
in one tiny space what happens.

773
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:22,210
In problem three you discover
that the fourth power of F

774
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,670
is the identity.

775
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:34,200
Except there is an N squared,
because from two F's we got

776
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,700
an N, so from four F's-- So
that's another fantastic fact

777
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,320
about the Fourier matrix.

778
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,640
That its fourth power,
it must be somehow,

779
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,070
the Fourier matrix
is rotating, yeah.

780
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:53,080
Somehow, I don't
know, how do you

781
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,580
understand that the
Fourier matrix is,

782
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,870
its fourth power brings
you back to the identity.

783
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:03,050
Apart from, we just
didn't normalize it.

784
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:07,850
So that we wouldn't, to
avoid that N squared,

785
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:09,340
so we had to use it.

786
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,590
Yeah.

787
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,880
That's pretty amazing.

788
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,110
Pretty amazing.

789
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:18,020
So if I had normalized
it right, if I

790
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:22,900
took F over the square
root of N, that's

791
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:28,120
the exact normalization
to give me a,

792
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,780
to put the N's where they
belong, you could say.

793
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,460
Then the fourth power of
that matrix is the identity.

794
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,420
Yeah.

795
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:43,230
New math and new applications
keep coming for these things.

796
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,750
I'll tell you, actually.

797
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,950
You could tell me
eigenvalues of this matrix.

798
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,950
Yeah, this is a good question.

799
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,700
What are the eigenvalues
of a matrix whose fourth

800
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,375
power is the identity?

801
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

802
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,416
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah, one.

803
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:01,660
What else could
the eigenvalue be?

804
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,200
If the fourth power
of the matrix is I,

805
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,810
what are the
possible eigenvalues?

806
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:16,430
So let me, so this matrix is,
can I call it M for the-- Or

807
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:30,180
maybe U for the matrix F--
So if U^4 is the identity,

808
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,570
what are the eigenvalues?

809
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,890
What could, well of course
u could be the identity,

810
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:36,040
but it's not.

811
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:41,060
It's the Fourier matrix.

812
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:46,330
So the eigenvalues could be
one, what else could they be?

813
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:48,410
Minus one is possible.

814
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:55,000
Because minus the identity,
that'd be fine. i, and minus i.

815
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,660
Four possible eigenvalues.

816
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,540
And when the matrix
reaches, I think

817
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:06,510
if you put the four by four
Fourier-- I don't know.

818
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,680
If you, say, put the
four by four Fourier

819
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,910
matrix into MATLAB, and see
what you get for eigenvalues,

820
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:16,820
I've forgotten whether you
get one of each of these.

821
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,790
Or whether somebody's
repeated at the level four,

822
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:23,030
but then go up to
five or six you'll

823
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,430
see these guys start showing up.

824
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:28,070
Different multiplicity.

825
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:28,900
Right?

826
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:34,500
The 1,024 matrix
has got these guys.

827
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,610
Some number of times,
adding up to a 1,024.

828
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,760
Right, yeah.

829
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,300
So it's quite neat.

830
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,020
Now, here's a question,
which I actually

831
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,950
just learned a good answer to.

832
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,970
What are the eigenvectors?

833
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,520
What are the eigenvectors?

834
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,270
You could give a sort of
half-baked description.

835
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,740
Because once you
know the eigenvalues.

836
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,400
But to really get a handle on
the eigenvectors, that's has

837
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:08,370
been a problem that was studied
in IEEE transactions papers.

838
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:12,670
But not really the right, not
a nice specific description

839
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:13,770
of the eigenvectors.

840
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:18,980
And somebody was in my
office, this fall, a guy,

841
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,400
post-doc at Berkeley
who's seen the right way

842
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,620
to look at that problem and
describe the eigenvectors

843
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,010
of the Fourier matrix.

844
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,850
So that's, like,
amazing to me that such

845
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:34,210
a fundamental
question was waiting.

846
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:40,020
And turned out to involve
quite important, deep ideas.

847
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,580
OK, ready for one
more for today?

848
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,720
Anything?

849
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,340
Or not.

850
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:52,750
OK, so I hope you're
getting the good stuff now

851
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,030
on the Fourier series.

852
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:57,030
Fourier discrete transform.

853
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,590
Please come on Friday,
because Friday will

854
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,300
be the big day for convolution.

855
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:09,620
And that's the essential thing
that we still have to do.

856
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,670
OK, see you Friday.
