9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,750
PROFESSOR STRANG: So,
shall we start, as always,

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,570
just open for questions.

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,150
About any topic.

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:34,080
I listed again trusses,
1-D finite elements,

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,540
grad, div, curl.

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,970
And I should have
squeezed in x+iy too,

15
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:46,000
as the magic trick for finding
solutions to Laplace's equation

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,400
in 2-D. So those are all
certainly topics that are

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,210
in this part of the course.

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,330
We didn't really get to
3-D, I'm sorry about that,

19
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,160
where the curl comes in.

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,900
Maybe I can say a few
words about curl today.

21
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,050
Anyway, questions.

22
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:03,830
Discussion.

23
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,530
Yes, thanks.

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,520
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Ooh, let's see.

26
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,070
So A^T A for a truss.

27
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,620
That's a good question.

28
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:27,490
Trusses, A^T A. I guess I don't
know any magic tricks either,

29
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,420
so one way is to construct
A, or A transpose,

30
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,420
and then just multiply.

31
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:43,290
A second way to do it would be
by the four by four bar element

32
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,700
matrices, so go bar by bar.

33
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,650
So four by four bar
matrices, four by four.

34
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:00,270
So those are already in
the A transpose A form.

35
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:08,480
They're little A element,
A bar transpose A, jeez,

36
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,380
this isn't a great
as it should be.

37
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:20,010
A element, but I don't
know if that would be,

38
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,150
so and then you pop those
into their correct places.

39
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,880
I don't think I know any
great idea beyond that.

40
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,450
I think you should really be
ready to construct a matrix A,

41
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,890
yeah.

42
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:44,250
For a reasonably small
truss, of course.

43
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,560
And of course the
other part of trusses,

44
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:56,070
the fun part is to be able to
recognize solutions to Au=0.

45
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:03,190
Possibly by looking at the
truss more than by solving Au=0.

46
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,700
Yeah, any particular example?

47
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,790
Of a truss that I should look
at just to pin this down?

48
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,530
Any favorite trusses?

49
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,150
There was an exam question, what
was it, a complicated truss?

50
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,210
Let's just create a truss.

51
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,440
And just think about it.

52
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:35,160
Maybe I won't create the whole
matrix A. Here's a truss.

53
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,650
How's that for a truss?

54
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,430
So it's got-- And let me
put no supports on it.

55
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,260
Just, there's a
truss to think about.

56
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,290
Probably we won't get
to all the gory details

57
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,280
but if you look at that
truss, what's the shape of A?

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:06,680
Shape of the matrix A. I
have a row for every bar.

59
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,340
So one, two, three, four, five.

60
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,470
And how many columns
have I got, how many

61
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,620
unknown u's, unknown
displacements have I got?

62
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,740
Eight.

63
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,950
Two four, six, eight.

64
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:30,980
So I would expect Au=0
would probably have how many

65
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,960
independent solutions?

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,540
Three.

67
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,690
You don't know the exact
rank, that's exactly true.

68
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,880
There could be more
than three, right.

69
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,520
So to really pin
it down you'd have

70
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,370
to be sure you were
right about that.

71
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,050
So three, at least.

72
00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:01,800
And I guess here you could tell
me the three solutions to Au=0.

73
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,640
Three rigid motions.

74
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,830
I could translate it to the
right, I could translate it up,

75
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,790
and you would know
what the u is,

76
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:16,910
so u translating to the right
would be [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1,

77
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,360
0], right?

78
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,370
That's horizontal motion
all the same, rigid motion.

79
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,200
And we should certainly
discover that if we created A

80
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,830
for this truss,
that Au was zero.

81
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,010
And similarly vertical motion
and the third one would be?

82
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,640
Rotation, rotation.

83
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,690
Yeah.

84
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,740
So if I did the rotation
around there, for example,

85
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,250
this guy would-- this u
would also be a [1, 0] here.

86
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,900
This wouldn't move.

87
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,950
So I'm putting in the four
pieces that would go into u.

88
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,550
This one, what would be the
u for this, the displacement

89
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,600
of that corner of the truss?

90
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,530
In a rotation?

91
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:12,470
So my rotation is just swing
this whole thing around.

92
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,660
Zero? [0, -1], I think.

93
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,470
Right.

94
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,380
Because it's not
going to go out,

95
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,430
it's going to go
straight down, [0, -1].

96
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,520
And what do you think this
guy is? [1, -1], let's see.

97
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,100
It's going to go
this way, so it's

98
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,020
going to go forward and down.

99
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,570
And I think you're right.

100
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,370
One and negative one, yeah.

101
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,190
I think that would be right.

102
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:46,310
Yeah, then the truss,
we could check each bar.

103
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,010
That bar, for example,
should not change length

104
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,630
because the movement is
perpendicular to the bar

105
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,830
and I'm writing
ones, but I really

106
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,550
should write some much smaller
number like .1 everywhere,

107
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,350
or something just so that
this isn't a very big angle.

108
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,910
And it wouldn't change
length to first order.

109
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:16,980
So that that's maybe an example
where we see the motions,

110
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,380
but we didn't actually
create A, and we should

111
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,420
be able to create A,
don't let me prevent you

112
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,380
from thinking about A. Yeah.

113
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,929
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Should those be ones,

114
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:32,470
or should they be
root two over twos?

115
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,386
PROFESSOR STRANG: Well,
that's a good question

116
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:39,590
and after many years I've
figured out that they're ones.

117
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,730
But it's a very good question.

118
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's just see why.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,970
Let's look at this bar to
be sure it's not stretched.

120
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,570
Right?

121
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,910
So this guy is moving over
by one, and this also by one,

122
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,980
is my claim.

123
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,180
And then this movement
down doesn't stretch it

124
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,890
to first order, yeah.

125
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,450
So I needed to make
those guys the same.

126
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,320
I guess what I figured out is
that if you're rotating around

127
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:14,340
here, then somehow it's the
x and y, is that-- Anyway.

128
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,330
Whatever.

129
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:26,650
So that gives us a chance
to do a specific example.

130
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,070
OK, but I've dodged the
creation of A. Yep, thanks.

131
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:37,600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

132
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,040
PROFESSOR STRANG: Sorry, the
solution to A transpose A?

133
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,424
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

134
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:47,840
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Yeah, I see, OK.

135
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,180
So the reason I stopped
here was that A transpose A

136
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,790
will be singular.

137
00:08:53,790 --> 00:09:00,440
So I wouldn't, like, go ahead,
go forward to A transpose Au=f.

138
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:08,430
But if I put on some supports,
then of course now all good.

139
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:14,840
So now I have, what's
now the shape of A?

140
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,210
For this one.

141
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:22,270
I now have this bar is
now, forget it, right?

142
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,840
This bar is just
between two supports.

143
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:31,100
So if we put it in the matrix
it'll just be a row of zeroes.

144
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,520
Nothing will happen,
and we're better off

145
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,990
to just knock it out.

146
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,470
So I think, now I have,
I now have four bars.

147
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,720
And how many unknowns?

148
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,420
Four: two there and two there.

149
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,340
And, do you guess
that it's stable?

150
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,570
That truss?

151
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,780
Yeah, that looks stable to me.

152
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,550
So the four by four
matrix would be invertible

153
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,050
and then I could solve.

154
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,750
Good point.

155
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,800
Then, A would be four
by four, A transpose

156
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,560
would be four by four, C would
be four by four in between.

157
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,450
This is the case that-- I
gave a name for this case.

158
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,770
When I have a square matrix,
do you remember the name just

159
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,900
for the hell of it?

160
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,690
Statically determinate.

161
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,520
It's determinate because each
step determines everything

162
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,580
completely.

163
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,360
Normally, if I have
another bar there,

164
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,090
now it would be five
by four, and now

165
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:36,020
I really have to do the A
transpose C A to get to a four

166
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,590
by four invertible.

167
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:43,350
By itself, A would
not be invertible.

168
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,230
This is the more typical
case, where you really

169
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,190
have to put all three together.

170
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,410
Right.

171
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,920
I hope you enjoyed the trusses
part, though, and continue

172
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,050
to enjoy them this evening.

173
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,410
OK, I'll just keep
moving to be sure

174
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,220
that we cover any other topics.

175
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,840
Yeah, thanks.

176
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,834
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

177
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,250
PROFESSOR STRANG:
For this matrix?

178
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,036
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

179
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:14,410
PROFESSOR STRANG:
For that truss?

180
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,960
Oh my God.

181
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,260
OK, let me see.

182
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,680
Then can I do one row?

183
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,990
OK, of course, you guys are
responsible for much more.

184
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,310
Alright, which row shall I do?

185
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,310
Which bar?

186
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,430
A diagonal bar?

187
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,210
I knew you'd make it like,
you could make up quizzes

188
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,180
and I could just sit back here.

189
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,860
OK, so let's take this
diagonal bar, alright.

190
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,470
And are we going to keep
that supported, or not?

191
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,590
Do you want to
keep it supported?

192
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,530
OK, so in this case then
that end is not moving.

193
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,960
So this will be in
this, and this bar

194
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:01,470
corresponds to a row of A.
And how many non-zeroes will

195
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,540
I expect in that row?

196
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,750
Just two.

197
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,410
Normally four, but I'm not
getting any motion down here.

198
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,500
So it'll just be two and
if that's 45 degrees,

199
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,370
shall we say, then that
row, I think, would be what?

200
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,320
Well, OK.

201
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,680
Where do my non-zeroes appear?

202
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,080
This is node number
one with an H and a V.

203
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,910
So I think we have zeroes.

204
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:37,400
If that bar stretches-- The
connection between displacement

205
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,840
and stretching of this bar
does not involve this guy.

206
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,800
So I think it's
zero and zero there.

207
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,350
And now, what else is it?

208
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,200
So now come the
real numbers, which

209
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,320
I believe to be cosine
and sine of that angle.

210
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,400
Because if I, how much
does that bar stretch?

211
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,865
I know that I'm looking
for a cosine and a sine,

212
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:04,840
and if this goes positively,
then the bar does stretch.

213
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,060
If this goes positively,
that does stretch the bar

214
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,810
so I'm expecting
positive numbers there,

215
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,270
like the cosine, square
root of two over two,

216
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:20,360
and the sine, square
root of two over two.

217
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,670
Well, I dodged the bullet
of getting the whole matrix,

218
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,680
but maybe that would do it.

219
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,280
Why don't we do
this the top one?

220
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,790
Yeah.

221
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,370
Tell me the first, if
that's bar one, what would

222
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,950
be the first row of the matrix?

223
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,410
OK, it involves
both of these nodes.

224
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,080
But the angle is zero.

225
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,620
So that's going to
be a little special.

226
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:55,550
So if this goes
out horizontally,

227
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,350
I should really start
with the first one.

228
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,160
Is this goes horizontally
it compresses the bar,

229
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,500
I think we get a
minus one there.

230
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,670
If it goes vertically,
that doesn't do anything.

231
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,430
If this goes horizontally
it does do something.

232
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,090
If it goes vertically
it doesn't.

233
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:22,370
I'd say that would be the row of
the matrix coming from the top.

234
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,100
That would give
me the stretching.

235
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,840
You remember, I'm
always going to,

236
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,490
I think of
multiplying this by u.

237
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:37,200
I think of multiplying that by
[u 1 H, u 1 V, u 2 H, u 2 V],

238
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,960
and this top row
should give me you

239
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:57,930
u 2 H minus u 1 H, which
is the stretch in bar one.

240
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,470
So that would be a
typical one, this

241
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,870
would be at least
typical of one where

242
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,500
I do see a cosine and a sine.

243
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:15,270
And let me just finally add,
suppose this was not supported.

244
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,280
OK, suppose that's
not supported,

245
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,430
now I've got a couple more
columns to squeeze in.

246
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,220
Maybe I can somehow do it here.

247
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,820
Can I squeeze in the
two more columns?

248
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:31,240
So can you complete the
top row of the matrix?

249
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,310
Now I've got six columns.

250
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,550
Because here's two, here's
two, here's two more.

251
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,850
What goes on the top
row of a matrix now?

252
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,580
Zeroes, because this is
not affected by bar one.

253
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,920
But it is affected by this bar.

254
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,070
So it's going to show up in this
row, and how will it show up?

255
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,290
Two negatives, right.

256
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:59,450
A negative cosine and a negative
sine. and at 45 degrees I

257
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,220
can't tell the difference.

258
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,940
Because if these move forward,
that compresses the bar.

259
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,210
So the minus sign.

260
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:11,430
So again, the rows
add up to zero,

261
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:18,220
as we expect when the bar
is not touching a support.

262
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:26,240
This is not touching a
support, so it adds up to zero.

263
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:34,840
OK, we'll have a truss
problem this evening,

264
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,500
but not a big messy one.

265
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,320
How about finite elements?

266
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,000
You guys, do you
like finite elements?

267
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,180
I'm sort of hoping to
make them attractive.

268
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,960
I noticed a problem, just
to give us some specific one

269
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,850
to work on, and I don't remember
that it was a homework problem.

270
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:07,590
This is Section 3.1, number 18,
asks about the equation u''=0.

271
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:11,260
Well, we've talked
about it in class.

272
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:19,220
With u(0)=0 but u' of-- the
slope equal zero at the other

273
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,860
end.

274
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,130
So what's the picture if
I use linear elements?

275
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,300
I don't remember how many
I used in the problem.

276
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:34,500
Well, it allows you to
use N interior guys, one,

277
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:41,060
two, up to N, and then
another-- This will come in.

278
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,710
Or that's the point.

279
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,340
OK, so what's the
finite element method,

280
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,030
finite element
matrix K for this--

281
00:17:52,030 --> 00:18:01,360
So I want to do linear elements
and I want to construct K.

282
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,880
And, yeah, I guess.

283
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,580
Oh, I haven't
actually made anything

284
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,370
happen to this problem.

285
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,970
All zeroes is kind
of slow going.

286
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,840
u will be, the solution
will certainly be zero.

287
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:24,800
So maybe I'd better put in a
load here to get some action.

288
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:32,350
OK, well, yeah.

289
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,430
So I proposed this question
but now, is this a question

290
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,610
to think about?

291
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,490
I think that's a
reasonable example to do.

292
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,990
It's got the two types
of boundary conditions.

293
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,100
It's got the
right-hand side f, it's

294
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,440
got linear elements which means
it's kind of doable by hand.

295
00:18:51,440 --> 00:19:00,760
And we kind of know what
matrix to expect out of it.

296
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,280
What matrix do we expect?

297
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,370
What do I expect out
of linear elements,

298
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,690
do you remember the point about
linear elements on equally

299
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,300
spaced meshes?

300
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,510
That just brought back our
regular difference matrices.

301
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,300
So I'm expecting
this stiffness matrix

302
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,620
to be a difference matrix.

303
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,890
Anyway, the point
of this question

304
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,290
is, OK, I have a hat function,
I have a hat function,

305
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:34,940
I've a hat function, a hat
function, and is that the end?

306
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,560
Is that the complete list
of my trial functions?

307
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,660
One more, right?

308
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:48,530
Because this condition is, all
my trial and test functions

309
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,330
don't have to satisfy this.

310
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,580
So I'm allowed, and should
have, another guy there.

311
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,530
A half hat for that one.

312
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:06,350
You may say, don't let that
clown into the finite element

313
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,080
space but I think it should be.

314
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,900
The solution won't
use much of it.

315
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,450
Because the solution is
going to aim for zero slope.

316
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,850
But it's going to need a
little-- You see why it needs

317
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,360
a little bit, something here?

318
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,150
Because this thing
has slope down.

319
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,140
So if there's some
of that in there,

320
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:35,390
there better be somebody
else to cancel it.

321
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,580
If our approximation is going
to have about zero slope.

322
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,340
OK, so then.

323
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,000
Can you construct a matrix K?

324
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,110
Let's see, what's
the (2,3) entry?

325
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:52,487
So if I call this number
one, this number two,

326
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:53,570
oh, I've already numbered.

327
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,730
So number two and number
three, so that trial

328
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,790
function against that one.

329
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,450
What do I?

330
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:05,340
What's my formula for the (2,3)
entry of the stiffness matrix?

331
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,690
It's some integral, right?

332
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,920
And what do I integrate?

333
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,830
I integrate, yeah.

334
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,560
And I've got to
have to remember.

335
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:22,470
So I do, yeah, my weak form--
I've integrated by parts,

336
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:28,670
so my weak form is the integral
of u'*v'*dx equals the integral

337
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:33,010
of f times. v dx.

338
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,120
That's my weak form.

339
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:41,070
I did two integrations by
parts and the integrated term

340
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,870
will go away.

341
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,430
Because of those zeroes.

342
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:52,020
OK, so K_(2,3) will come from
this side when I'm using phi_2

343
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,380
and phi_3, because
I'm taking the phis,

344
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,460
the phis and the V's both
the same hat function.

345
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:08,270
OK, so what do I get
for that? phi_2' is?

346
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:12,030
So this is it, and
it overlaps this one.

347
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,290
So when it overlaps this
phi_2 is coming down

348
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,480
and phi_3 is going up.

349
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,210
And the slope is 1/h, let's say.

350
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:30,240
So I think I'm integrating us a
negative slope, is that right?

351
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,840
Times a positive slope.

352
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,960
And I'm really only integrating
over one h interval.

353
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,550
The two overlap only here,
where this one's coming down

354
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,020
and that one's going up.

355
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,920
So I think-- dx.

356
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,170
And the great thing is, of
course, we have a constant.

357
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,880
So I have minus one
over h squared times h,

358
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,230
I think minus one over h.

359
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,990
That would be K_(2,3).

360
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:08,070
That's a simple example.

361
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:19,050
And then at the end we will
see it, we'll see this one,

362
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,850
I think we'll get some matrix.

363
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,340
We'll have this 1/h
outside, I think

364
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,980
we'll have something like two,
minus one; two, minus one;

365
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,330
minus one and then only
a one from the half-hat.

366
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:39,190
I think it would be that matrix
that would be K. I think.

367
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,440
Maybe with more,
greater size if we

368
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,920
have a whole bunch of elements.

369
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,590
But that pattern.

370
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,260
You're pretty much into this?

371
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,420
Yeah, I mean we're doing
a lot in this course.

372
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:59,090
I'm really grateful
you guys stay with it,

373
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:06,770
and kept to these new ideas,
through doing exercises

374
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,420
and so on.

375
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,510
Because there's a lot here.

376
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,440
Well, I thought I'd
put an example up,

377
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,650
to open up, just
to remind you what

378
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,360
that language is about there.

379
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,340
And to be ready for any
question in that topic.

380
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,600
Or any question whatever.

381
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,990
So I jumped in with
finite elements,

382
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:37,320
but I'm ready also to talk
about that area of the course.

383
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

384
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:44,630
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Yeah. x+iy stuff, OK.

385
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,940
Basically, any
function of x+iy, yeah.

386
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,570
Any function.

387
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,630
So strictly, yeah, I mean a
mathematician would say what,

388
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,640
any function?

389
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:02,200
That's, you've opened the door
to crazy things saying that.

390
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,700
So what I really mean is, we
have these powers of x+iy,

391
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,840
and then we have
combinations of them.

392
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,430
So the only requirement
would be that if I

393
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,760
want to take an
infinite combination

394
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,170
it should, the series
should, add up to something.

395
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,180
If it has a nice
Taylor series then

396
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,450
those are the best
functions there are.

397
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,730
Functions with
nice Taylor series.

398
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,290
I'll just say it.

399
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,880
Having used those words.

400
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,130
Suppose I take that function.

401
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,850
There's a function, that's
a function-- z is x+iy.

402
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:46,270


403
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:50,160
But z is shorter to write.

404
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,640
So it's not a
polynomial, obviously.

405
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,770
But it is a function of x+iy.

406
00:25:54,770 --> 00:26:00,620


407
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,180
Well, tell me this.

408
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,510
Where does that
function go wrong?

409
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:10,820
So e^z is a function that
never goes wrong, right? e^z,

410
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,270
that series always converges.

411
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:18,600
Can you tell me the series, if
I expand that into a series,

412
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,960
what series am I looking at?

413
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,900
This is not on the
exam, so to speak.

414
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,130
Do you know one over
one plus something,

415
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:39,730
what's the series for that?

416
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,370
Well the constant term, when
z is zero is certainly a one.

417
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,330
I think the trick, it's
this is geometric series,

418
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,500
and because it's a
z squared it's that.

419
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,160
That would be the
geometric series.

420
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,630
With constant ratio z squared.

421
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:02,350
If I multiply that
by that, 1 plus z

422
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,330
squared times that,
everything will cancel

423
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,840
and I'll get the one.

424
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,800
That's it.

425
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,550
So there is a Taylor
series for this function.

426
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,780
Now, the reason I chose that
example is, you could tell me,

427
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,490
it doesn't converge if
z is too large, right?

428
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:28,040
Is this an analytic function?

429
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,840
Where is this a good
function and where does it

430
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,030
have problems?

431
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:38,540
If z is less than one, and I
really mean magnitude of z,

432
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,810
so let me draw the z-plane.

433
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:44,910
Here's the real part of z
that you usually call x,

434
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:49,370
and the imaginary part of
z that you usually call y,

435
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:55,190
because z is x+iy, and where
will this series converge?

436
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:01,840
It'll converge out as
far as this circle.

437
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,210
This is the Taylor
series around zero.

438
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:05,710
Right?

439
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:10,640
The constant term
I found at z=0.

440
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,550
Then that series, this
function, is great.

441
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,860
It's an analytic
function, everything,

442
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,480
it gives us a solution to
Laplace's-- This'll be,

443
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,530
the real and imaginary parts
of that will be the u and the s

444
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,930
that solve Laplace's equation.

445
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:33,450
Out to, at least in this circle.

446
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:38,180
But something, there's a problem
at the edge of the circle.

447
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,400
Now, here's my point.

448
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,550
If I think of one over
one plus x squared,

449
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,310
look at that for a minute.

450
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,930
That function has no
problems at all, right?

451
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,500
One over one plus x squared,
you can let x be anything?

452
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,880
It's no trouble.

453
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,840
But one over one
plus z squared, when

454
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,190
we look in the complex
plane, ah, we find a problem.

455
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,740
And where is the problem
with this function?

456
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,530
At z equals, so everybody's
looking at this guy.

457
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:16,730
There's a problem with
that function at z=i.

458
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,200
And it happens to
be not an accident,

459
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,430
it's right there on the circle.

460
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:26,820
It's hiding in the complex--
it's not on the real axis.

461
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,630
So the real person
didn't notice it.

462
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,280
But the complex person said
ah, that's the problem.

463
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,310
There's a singularity there, and
of course it's called a pole,

464
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:42,840
and people in so many parts of
science are interested in that.

465
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,500
Is there any other place
that there's a problem?

466
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,990
At minus i.

467
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,870
When z is minus i we'll
also get a problem.

468
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:56,760
So this is a function with
two poles, those two poles

469
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:05,510
and they're the reason that
the series couldn't make it.

470
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,330
Going out this way the series
doesn't meet any problems.

471
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:14,170
But the series always
goes out in a circle,

472
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:18,150
and the first circle, the first
guy, the first problem it hits,

473
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,480
the series stops converging.

474
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,400
By the way, let me
ask you a question.

475
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,760
Suppose I instead did the
Taylor series around this point?

476
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,680
Now, what do I mean by that?

477
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,630
That's the point one, let's say.

478
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,620
What do I mean by that, the
Taylor series around one?

479
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:41,820
I'll rewrite the function as one
plus, well now, what do I do?

480
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,680
I want it in z
minus one squared.

481
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,720
Oh, gosh.

482
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:54,660
I'm getting beyond what
you will care about.

483
00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:00,820
Again, if I expanded, if I wrote
the power series in powers of z

484
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,490
minus one, what
would it work in?

485
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,900
And then I'll stop
with this example.

486
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,950
The circle would reach
out until it hit a pole.

487
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,700
And it can't make
it past that pole.

488
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,630
So it would be a circle of
radius square root of two,

489
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,700
there would be a circle there.

490
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,690
If we were going to
discuss, and this is really

491
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,050
Chapter 5 of the book.

492
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:34,030
I mention it, because you've
got a book that explains this.

493
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,690
If I thought the center
of the universe was there,

494
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,470
and then the poles
are still here,

495
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,370
the circle will make
it out to those poles.

496
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,870
So I can do Taylor series, I
can sort of hook together Taylor

497
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,200
series all over the place.

498
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,470
And they'll all quit
when they reach a pole,

499
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,380
but when I put all
those circles together

500
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,990
I can get all the
rest of the plane.

501
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,750
OK, so that's something
about, I don't

502
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:06,220
know how I got onto that
department, but it's amazing.

503
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,580
This, so the real and imaginary
parts of that would be a flow,

504
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,080
would give me a flow.

505
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,390
I don't know if it'd be
easy to compute it or not,

506
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,310
maybe I won't tackle that here.

507
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,240
But we could find
the real part of that

508
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,280
and the imaginary part
of that, and we would

509
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:30,420
have a genuine flow field.

510
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,060
Satisfying Laplace's equation
with the two orthogonal,

511
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:38,550
the streamlines orthogonal
to the equipotentials.

512
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,840
We could totally
do that example.

513
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,480
OK, let me, yeah, thanks.

514
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,378
AUDIENCE: You say one test
question is based on x+iy?

515
00:32:48,378 --> 00:32:49,336
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

516
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:50,377
Well, this sort of stuff.

517
00:32:50,377 --> 00:32:55,180
But, so u would be
the, yeah that's right.

518
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:01,480
Yeah, so a test question
would be something like,

519
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,630
one way or another, you would
end up with a u, and an s,

520
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,200
and the u+is, if
they're a good pair,

521
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,370
would be some function
of this magic z.

522
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,609
Yeah, yeah.

523
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:17,150
That's right.

524
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:23,140
So whatever.

525
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,670
We know examples, of course.

526
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:30,050
For example, this could be
x squared minus y squared.

527
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,840
And the s that goes
with that is 2xy,

528
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,550
and the function that's involved
there when I throw in the i

529
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,020
is simply z squared.

530
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,750
OK, that would be
an example where

531
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,640
the real and imaginary parts
of this give us the good u,

532
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,810
its good friend
s, and the picture

533
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:59,880
of streamlines
and equipotentials

534
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,820
meeting at right angles.

535
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:06,880
Just, a beautiful picture, all
coming out of this function.

536
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,990
So probably the quiz will
have some other function.

537
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:20,250
But you'll still have a u and
an s and a function of x+iy.

538
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,750
So if it's not this one,
which I don't think it is.

539
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,480
It won't be be this one.

540
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,034
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

541
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:29,950
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes.

542
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:35,800
Because first of all, I wouldn't
have mentioned it if I was.

543
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,010
And secondly, that's
a little too messy,

544
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:43,220
I think, to get
a good handle of,

545
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,360
to take the real and
imaginary parts of that.

546
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,400
It's not impossible, of course.

547
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,210
We could completely do it.

548
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:57,120
There'd be some ratio
of two polynomials.

549
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:02,380
Here we have just
simple polynomials.

550
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,620
OK, does that help
with that question?

551
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,500
Yeah.

552
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:11,040
What else is on your mind?

553
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,380
Any thoughts?

554
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,100
Yeah, thanks.

555
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,490
Curl, OK.

556
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:21,520
Well, so I didn't really
do three dimensions.

557
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,940
But curl is important.

558
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,770
And we did see, in two
dimensions the key fact

559
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,410
that all this
stuff-- Let me just

560
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:39,120
write down what the great
connections are between these.

561
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,850
Because I can't let
the whole semester go

562
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:46,870
without writing down that,
what is it, the grad--

563
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:51,920
Is it the curl of a gradient?

564
00:35:51,920 --> 00:36:00,010
The curl of any gradient
of u is always zero.

565
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,820
Whatever it is.

566
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,470
Whatever u is.

567
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:09,550
And this comes from, let
me put the other one down

568
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:14,070
and then I'll just say why.

569
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,070
The other one is like the
transpose of this one.

570
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:20,070
So if I transpose, so
this is the zero operator.

571
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,970
Curl times gradient
gives the zero.

572
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,670
So if I just transpose
I still have zero.

573
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,190
So if it's a
transposed gradient,

574
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:31,190
I have minus divergence, and
actually if I transpose curl

575
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,310
I get curl again.

576
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:39,240
Of any, now I should put in,
what should the curl act on?

577
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,550
It acts on a w, I guess is.

578
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:49,760
No, divergence w, it
acts on an S, sorry.

579
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,227
OK, and the minus
sign, of course,

580
00:36:54,227 --> 00:36:55,810
isn't going to matter
because I've got

581
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,870
a zero on the right-hand side.

582
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:04,500
So S. Yeah, so if I take any
field-- I mean this is like,

583
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,030
real proper vector calculus.

584
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:13,100
To check these, I call them
identities and maybe sometimes

585
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,670
people indicate an identity
meaning it's always

586
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,470
true for every u,
or for every S.

587
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,640
They'll use the
triple equals sign.

588
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,070
Just to say they're
really equal.

589
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:34,580
OK, so we could define the curl,
but you've met it elsewhere

590
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:39,220
and maybe this isn't
the time to do that.

591
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,990
What's the key fact, the
key little math business

592
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,550
that makes all these true?

593
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:52,200
So there's sort of a formal
math fact that makes them true.

594
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,330
And then there's the
physical understanding

595
00:37:55,330 --> 00:38:03,030
of gradients being directions
out with no rotation.

596
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,240
So the physical
understanding of that.

597
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,100
But the math, the
formal math fact

598
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,640
is the fact that the second
derivative of u with respect

599
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,660
to x and y is equal to what?

600
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,000
It's equal to second derivative
with respect to y and x, yep.

601
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,160
So you would find if you
wrote out all the terms here,

602
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,270
or all the terms here,
you would find that

603
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:32,920
just by using that fact,
they all cancel each other.

604
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,870
And the book, of
course, does that.

605
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:42,740
So we simply didn't do 3-D in
the vector calculus section.

606
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,870
So I'll stop there with
that, because it's really

607
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,280
saying that the curl is
tremendously important.

608
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:59,450
It measures vorticity and flow,
and it's-- Being able to-- You

609
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:02,710
know that like, you take
the Navier-Stokes equations?

610
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:09,460
Well, the pressure and
the velocity are the,

611
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,260
I'd say primary variables
or the natural quantities

612
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,160
to measure, pressure and
velocity for a fluid flow.

613
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,410
But you could also use
these identities to set up

614
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,590
in terms of other variables.

615
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:32,890
Just rewrite the equation
and you get other things.

616
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:39,950
Mentioning Navier-Stokes and
fluid flow reminds me to say,

617
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:44,180
we keep using the example
of Laplace's equation.

618
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,120
And a person could say wait
a minute, get beyond that.

619
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,610
Right?

620
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:54,050
So why are you always, when
you teach finite elements,

621
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,600
why do you always start
with Laplace's equation?

622
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,930
OK, well the main reason
is it's the simplest one.

623
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,890
It's the one where you can
really see what's happening.

624
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:06,160
More complicated
equations would be for,

625
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,300
like, elasticity, plane
elasticity, or 3-D elasticity

626
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:17,040
or other boundary value
problems could be quite messy.

627
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:23,240
But Laplace's equation is
not totally a waste of time.

628
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,510
First, it comes up when you
have these scalar unknowns.

629
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:31,370
And then it also comes
up in numerical methods

630
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,760
for Navier-Stokes.

631
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,500
So the standard numerical
method for Navier-Stokes,

632
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:42,020
which would come
in 18.086, ends up

633
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,600
with Laplace's equation
for the pressure.

634
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:51,910
So to have a fast Laplace
solver, as in today's lecture,

635
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,870
pays off.

636
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:56,400
So I'm just saying
Laplace's equation

637
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,020
is important in itself,
it has the great advantage

638
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,820
of being the simplest example
we could possibly think of.

639
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,460
It's the example where
an x+iy trick works.

640
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:11,960
And it actually comes up in
serious big computations,

641
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,040
because the equation
for the pressure

642
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,690
comes out to be a Laplace
or a Poisson equation.

643
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,290
Now.

644
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,000
I kept going there.

645
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,690
Yeah, thank you.

646
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:28,970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

647
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,140
PROFESSOR STRANG: We
did, as a MATLAB problem.

648
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

649
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,560
PROFESSOR STRANG: Sorry?

650
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,730
And a first order, right.

651
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

652
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,810
PROFESSOR STRANG: Huh.

653
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,580
Yeah.

654
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,351
I would do it the same way
but it wouldn't be symmetric,

655
00:41:44,351 --> 00:41:44,850
of course.

656
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:48,070
That was the point about
that convection term,

657
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,650
is-- The diffusion term would
be just what we've done, right?

658
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,220
The diffusion term was
that second derivative.

659
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,980
And what would it
look like in, as long

660
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:01,340
as we're close to, what would
convection-diffusion in 2-D

661
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,230
look like?

662
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:08,000
Just, I mean part
of your interest

663
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,730
is pass 18.085 and
get rid of it, right?

664
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:16,590
But another part is
like, these are problems

665
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:22,197
that if you're in Course
16, Course 2, others,

666
00:42:22,197 --> 00:42:23,280
you're going to meet this.

667
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,430
So the diffusion
part is going to be,

668
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:32,370
again in 2-D I'll have
some minus u, well,

669
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:36,970
I made it simple because
I took c(x) to be one.

670
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,460
It could have a c(x) in there.

671
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,360
And what would the
convection term look like?

672
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:49,210
I'd have a velocity, in
the x direction, say a V_x.

673
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,820
And a velocity in
the y direction, V_y.

674
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,340
V_y times-- That's
just a number.

675
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,030
In the simplest case that
would be my river is traveling,

676
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:09,675
or my flow is traveling
along, and equals zero.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

678
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,400
PROFESSOR STRANG: Sorry?

679
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,870
Yeah I don't know which way the
river's traveling, actually.

680
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:19,970
So those are just constants.

681
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:23,070
They could have positive
or negative signs.

682
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,800
The V_x and V_y is the
constant flow that's carrying,

683
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,050
what am I doing here?

684
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,990
The flow is flowing along,
and if those are constants

685
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,300
it's just flowing
steady, steady flow.

686
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,840
But it's diffusing
at the same time.

687
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,640
And this would bring in
that same difficulties

688
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,370
that we met in the MATLAB 1-D.
So the MATLAB 1-D problem just

689
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:50,480
didn't have a y.

690
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,260
I don't care, yeah the
sign I'm not worried about,

691
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,490
it's just is that
there, now I'm in 2-D.

692
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,380
And what would I expect to see?

693
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,810
I'd expect to see some
trouble when V is large.

694
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:06,960
When V is large, convection,
this is convection down here.

695
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,390
This is the convection part.

696
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:15,800
And if V is large, then so that
this should be a lower order

697
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,590
term, is really fighting
against this higher order term.

698
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:24,090
I expect numerical difficulties,
just the way we met.

699
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:30,190
So anyway, if I did a MATLAB
example, stretched it to 2-D

700
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:34,120
we see a whole lot
of interesting stuff.

701
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,820
We'd see flow in,
flow out, yeah.

702
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,180
But I just can't do everything.

703
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,910
But that would have a weak
form, but your question

704
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,150
about weak forms,
weak form, when

705
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,380
you have this
anti-symmetric term

706
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:52,870
for odd number of derivatives,
is not quite as beautiful.

707
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,050
But you have to deal
with it, of course.

708
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,860
Yep.

709
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,810
OK, Ready for whatever.

710
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:02,980
Any thoughts?

711
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,360
Let's see, just
have a look again

712
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:11,540
at the list of problem topics.

713
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,130
To see if anything
occurs to you.

714
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,480
I mean, not that it should.

715
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:23,210
You know we're OK.

716
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:27,290
I'm happy to call
it a day on that,

717
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:32,720
and time for dinner for
everybody and see you at 7:30.
