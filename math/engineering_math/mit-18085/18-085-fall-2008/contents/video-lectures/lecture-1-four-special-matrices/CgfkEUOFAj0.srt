9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,580
PROFESSOR STRANG: Just to give
an overview in three lines:

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,780
the text is the book of that
name, Computational Science

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,570
and Engineering.

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,390
That was completed
just last year,

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,040
so it really ties pretty
well with the course.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,890
I don't cover everything
in the book, by all means.

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,630
And I don't, certainly, don't
stand here and read the book.

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,290
That would be no good.

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,430
But you'll be able, if
you miss a class -- well,

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,530
don't miss a class.

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,420
But if you miss a class,
you'll be able, probably,

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,190
to see roughly what we did.

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,100
OK, so the first
part of the semester

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,660
is applied linear algebra.

23
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,990
And I don't know how many of
you have had a linear algebra

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,470
course, and that's
why I thought I would

25
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,490
start with a quick review.

26
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,500
And you'll catch on.

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,670
I want matrices to
come to life, actually.

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,754
You know, instead
of just being a four

29
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:33,610
by four array of numbers,
there are four by four,

30
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,970
or n by n or m by n
array of special numbers.

31
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,400
They have a meaning.

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,780
When they multiply a
vector, they do something.

33
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,700
And so it's just, part
of this first step

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,190
is just, like,
getting to recognize,

35
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,760
what's that matrix doing?

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,180
Where does it come from?

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,910
What are its properties?

38
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,210
So that's a theme at the start.

39
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:04,050
Then differential equations,
like Laplace's equation,

40
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,530
are beautiful examples.

41
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,300
So here we get, especially,
to numerical methods,

42
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,770
finite differences, finite
elements, above all.

43
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,510
So I think in this
class you'll really

44
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,390
see how finite elements
work, and other ideas.

45
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,890
All sorts of ideas.

46
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,990
And then the last part of
the course is about Fourier.

47
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,400
That's Fourier series,
that you may have seen,

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,540
and Fourier integrals.

49
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,000
But also, highly important,
Discrete Fourier Transform,

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,190
DFT.

51
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,410
That's a fundamental
step for understanding

52
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,770
what a signal contains.

53
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,060
Yeah, so that's
great stuff, Fourier.

54
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,620
OK, what else should
I say before I start?

55
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,010
I said this was my
favorite course,

56
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:01,730
and maybe I'll
elaborate a little.

57
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,190
Well, I think what I want
to say is that I really

58
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,740
feel my life is here to teach
you and not to grade you.

59
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,040
I'm not going to spend this
semester worrying about grades,

60
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,040
and please don't.

61
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,610
They come out fine.

62
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,200
We've got lots to learn.

63
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,630
And I'll do my very best
to explain it clearly.

64
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,090
And I know you'll do your best.

65
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,380
I know from experience.

66
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,400
This class goes for
it and does it right.

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,510
So that's what makes it so good.

68
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,410
OK.

69
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,840
Homeworks, by the way,
well, the first homework

70
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,870
will simply be a way to get a
grade list, a list of everybody

71
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,180
taking the course.

72
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,820
They won't be graded
in great detail.

73
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,610
Too large a class.

74
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,520
And you're allowed to talk
to each other about homework.

75
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,970
So homework is not
an exam at all.

76
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,450
So let me just leave any
discussion of exams and grades

77
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,180
for the future.

78
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,010
I'll tell you, you'll see how
informally the first homework

79
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,370
will be.

80
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,120
And I hope it'll go
up on the website.

81
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,700
The first homework
will be for Monday.

82
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,340
So it's a bit early, but
it's pretty open-ended.

83
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,070
If you could take three
problems from 1.1,

84
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,920
the first section of
the book, any three,

85
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:43,960
and any three problems from
1.2, and print your name

86
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,920
on the homework -- because we're
going to use that to create

87
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,030
the grade list -- I'll
be completely happy.

88
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,810
Well, especially if
you get them right

89
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,820
and do them neatly and so on.

90
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,110
But actually we won't know.

91
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,760
So that's for Monday.

92
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,320
OK.

93
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,430
And we'll talk more about it.

94
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,750
I'll announce the TA on the
website and the TA hours,

95
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,950
the office hours,
and everything.

96
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,210
There'll be a Friday
afternoon office hour,

97
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,241
because homeworks will
typically come Monday.

98
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:20,740
OK.

99
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:27,050
Questions about the course
before I just start?

100
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,140
OK.

101
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,660
Another time for questions, too.

102
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:41,450
OK, so can we just
start with that matrix?

103
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,130
So I said about matrices, I'm
interested in their properties.

104
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,990
Like, I'm going to
ask you about that.

105
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,050
And then, I'm interested
in their meaning.

106
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,200
Where do they come from?

107
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,530
You know, why that matrix
instead of some other?

108
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,090
And then, the numerical part
is how do we deal with them?

109
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,400
How do we solve a linear system
with that coefficient matrix?

110
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
What can we say
about the solution?

111
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,830
So the purpose.

112
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,330
Right.

113
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:15,040
OK, now help me out.

114
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,520
So I guess my plan
with the video taping

115
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,410
is, whatever you
say, I'll repeat.

116
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:26,140
So say it as clearly
as possible, and it's

117
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,810
fantastic to have discussion,
conversation here.

118
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,130
So I'll just repeat it so that
it safely gets on the tape.

119
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,880
So tell me its properties.

120
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,310
Tell me the first property that
you notice about that matrix.

121
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,810
Symmetric.

122
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,910
Symmetric.

123
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,150
Right.

124
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,730
I could have slowed
down a little

125
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,310
and everybody probably would
have said that at once.

126
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,790
So that's a symmetric matrix.

127
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,770
Now we might as well pick
up some matrix notation.

128
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,970
How do I express the fact
that this a symmetric matrix?

129
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,890
In simple matrix
notation, I would

130
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:07,260
say that K is the
same as K transpose.

131
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,710
The transpose, everybody
knows, it comes from -- oh,

132
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,870
I shouldn't say this --
flipping it across the diagonal.

133
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,830
That's not a very
"math" thing to do.

134
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,960
But that's the way
to visualize it.

135
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,560
And let me use a
capital T for transpose.

136
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,460
So it's symmetric.

137
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,340
Very important.

138
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,660
Very, very important.

139
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,850
That's the most important
class of matrices,

140
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,840
symmetric matrices.

141
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,890
We'll see them all
the time, because they

142
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,310
come from equilibrium problems.

143
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,870
They come from all sorts
of -- they come everywhere

144
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,060
in applications.

145
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,800
And we will be
doing applications.

146
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,180
The first week or
week and a half,

147
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,540
you'll see pretty
much discussion

148
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,710
of matrices and the reasons,
what their meaning is.

149
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,440
And then we'll get to
physical applications:

150
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,750
mechanics and more.

151
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,680
OK.

152
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,720
All right.

153
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,230
Now I'm looking for
properties, other properties,

154
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,430
of that matrix.

155
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,340
Let me write "2" here so that
you got a spot to put it.

156
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,420
What are you going to tell
me next about that matrix?

157
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,040
Periodic.

158
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,270
Well, okay.

159
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,200
Actually, that's
a good question.

160
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,280
Let me write periodic down here.

161
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,110
You're using that word,
because somehow that pattern

162
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,480
is suggesting something.

163
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,150
But you'll see I
have a little more

164
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,420
to add before I would
use the word periodic.

165
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,060
So that's great
to see that here.

166
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,560
What else?

167
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,260
Somebody else was
going to say something.

168
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,370
Please.

169
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,040
Sparse!

170
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,240
Oh, very good.

171
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,500
Sparse.

172
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,350
That's also an obvious
property that you

173
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,220
see from looking at the matrix.

174
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,550
What does sparse mean?

175
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,200
Mostly zeros.

176
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,870
Well that isn't
mostly zeros, I guess.

177
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,840
I mean, that's got what,
out of sixteen entries,

178
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,560
it's got six zeros.

179
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,930
That doesn't sound like sparse.

180
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,466
But when I grow the matrix --
because this is just a four

181
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:21,040
by four.

182
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,550
I would even call this one K_4.

183
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,580
When the matrix
grows to 100 by 100,

184
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,910
then you really
see it as sparse.

185
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,490
So if that matrix was 100
by 100, how many non-zeros

186
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,430
would it have?

187
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:44,010
So if n is 100, then the
number of non-zeros -- wow,

188
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,530
that's the first MATLAB
command I've written.

189
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,620
A number of non-zeros
of K would be --

190
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,160
anybody know what it would be?

191
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:00,750
I'm just asking to go
up to five by five.

192
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,860
I'm asking you to keep
that pattern alive.

193
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,330
Twos on the diagonal,
minus ones above and below.

194
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:13,640
So yeah, so 298, would it be?

195
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,020
A hundred diagonal entries,
99 and 99, maybe 298?

196
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:27,590
298 out of 100 by
100 would be what?

197
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,140
It's been a long summer.

198
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,090
Yeah, a lot of zeros.

199
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,710
A lot.

200
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,210
Right.

201
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,760
Because the matrix has got what
100 by 100, 10,000 entries.

202
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,620
Out of 10,000.

203
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,300
So that's sparse.

204
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,090
But we see those all the
time, and fortunately we do.

205
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,050
Because, of course, this
matrix, or even 100 by 100,

206
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,000
we could deal with
if it was dense.

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,640
But 10,000, 100,000,
or 1 million,

208
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,390
which happens all the time
now in scientific computation.

209
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,510
A million by
million dense matrix

210
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,170
is not a nice thing
to think about.

211
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:13,780
A million by million matrix
like this is a cinch.

212
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,280
OK.

213
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,940
So sparse.

214
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,550
What else do you want to say?

215
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,490
Toeplitz.

216
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,600
Holy Moses.

217
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,920
Exactly right.

218
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,550
But I want to say,
before I use that word,

219
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,540
so that'll be my
second MATLAB command.

220
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,060
Thanks.

221
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,780
Toeplitz.

222
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,850
What's that mean?

223
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,680
So this matrix has
a property that we

224
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,940
see right away, which is?

225
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,450
I want to stay with Toeplitz
but everybody tell me

226
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,860
something more about
properties of that matrix.

227
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,100
Tridiagonal.

228
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:02,880
Tridiagonal, so that's almost
a special subcase of sparse.

229
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,530
It has just three diagonals.

230
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,440
Tridiagonal matrices
are truly important.

231
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,070
They come in all
the time, we'll see

232
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:14,080
that they come from second order
differential equations, which

233
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,360
are, thanks to
Newton, the big ones.

234
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,090
Ok, now it's more than
tridiagonal and what more?

235
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,850
So what further, we're
getting deeper now.

236
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,970
What patterns do you see
beyond just tridiagonal,

237
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,950
because tridiagonal would
allow any numbers there

238
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,150
but those are not, there's more
of a pattern than just three

239
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,490
diagonals, what is it?

240
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,770
Those diagonals are constant.

241
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,780
If I run down each of
those three diagonals,

242
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,350
I see the same number.

243
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,370
Twos, minus ones,
minus ones, and that's

244
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,670
what the word Toeplitz means.

245
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:05,280
Toeplitz is constant diagonal.

246
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,850
Ok.

247
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,840
And that kind of
matrix is so important.

248
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:17,730
It corresponds, yeah,
if we were in EE,

249
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:23,240
I would use the words
time-invariant filter, linear,

250
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,920
time-invariant.

251
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,840
So it's linear because
we're dealing with a matrix.

252
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,750
And it's time-invariant,
shift-invariant.

253
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,900
I just use all these
equivalent words

254
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,300
to mean that we're
seeing the same thing row

255
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,000
by row, except of course, at,
shall I call that the boundary?

256
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,370
That's like, the end
of the system and this

257
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,740
is like the other end and
there it's chopped off.

258
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,070
But if it was ten by ten I
would see that row eight times.

259
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,980
100 by 100 I'd see it 98 times.

260
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:05,030
So it's constant diagonals
and the guy who first

261
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,350
studied that was Toeplitz.

262
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,470
And we wouldn't need that
great historical information

263
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,700
except that MATLAB created a
command to create that matrix.

264
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:25,750
K, MATLAB is all set to
create Toeplitz matrices.

265
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,110
Yeah, so I'll have to put
what MATLAB would put.

266
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:37,460
I realize I'm already
using the word MATLAB.

267
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,030
I think that MATLAB language
is really convenient

268
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,050
to talk about linear algebra.

269
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,550
And how many know
MATLAB or have used it?

270
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,120
Yeah.

271
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,650
You know it better than I. I
talk a good line with MATLAB

272
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,760
but I -- the code never runs.

273
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,300
Never!

274
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,560
I always forget some
stupid semicolon.

275
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,970
You may have had
that experience.

276
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:11,519
And I just want to say it now
that there are other languages,

277
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,185
and if you want to
do homeworks and want

278
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:18,340
to do your own work in other
languages, that makes sense.

279
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,290
So the older
established alternatives

280
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,800
were Mathematica and
Maple and those two

281
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,230
have symbolic-- they can
deal with algebra as well

282
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,320
as numbers.

283
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,990
But there are newer languages.

284
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,040
I don't know if you know them.

285
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,270
I just know my friends
say, yes they're terrific.

286
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:46,050
Python is one.

287
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,150
And R. I've just
had a email saying,

288
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,290
tell your class
about R. And others.

289
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:59,670
Ok, so but we'll use MATLAB
language because that's really

290
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,060
a good common language.

291
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,370
Ok, so what is a
Toeplitz matrix?

292
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,050
A Toeplitz matrix is one
with constant diagonals.

293
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,220
You could use the
word time-invariant,

294
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,260
linear time-invariant filter.

295
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,860
And to create K, this
is an 18.085 command.

296
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,400
It's just set up for us.

297
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:26,350
I can create K by telling
the system the first row.

298
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:32,360
Two, minus one, zero, zero.

299
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,340
That would, then if
it wasn't symmetric

300
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,370
I would have to give
the first column also.

301
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,990
Toeplitz would be
constant diagonal,

302
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,130
it doesn't have to be symmetric.

303
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,050
But if it's symmetric, then
the first row and first column

304
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,470
are the same vector, so I
just have to give that vector.

305
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,570
Okay, so that's the
quickest way to create K.

306
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,100
And of course, if it
was bigger then I would,

307
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:08,120
rather than writing 100 zeros,
I could put zeros of 98 and one.

308
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,930
Wouldn't I have to say that?

309
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,410
Or is it one and 98?

310
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,910
You see why it doesn't run.

311
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,740
Well I guess I'm thinking
of that as a row.

312
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,610
I don't know.

313
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:24,560
Anyway.

314
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,830
I realize getting this
videotaped means I'm

315
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,090
supposed to get things right!

316
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,410
Usually it's like, we'll
get it right later.

317
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:36,170
But anyway, that might work.

318
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,340
Okay.

319
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,870
So there's a command
that you know.

320
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,250
"zeros", that creates a matrix
of this size with all zeros.

321
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,560
Okay.

322
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,380
That would create
the 100 by 100.

323
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,910
Good.

324
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,110
Ok.

325
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,350
Oh, by the way, as long as
we're speaking about computation

326
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,710
I've gotta say something more.

327
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,290
We said that the
matrix is sparse.

328
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,360
And this 100 by 100 matrix
is certainly sparse.

329
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,880
But if I create it this way,
I've created all those zeros

330
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,550
and if I ask MATLAB to work
with that matrix, to square it

331
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:18,810
or whatever, it would
carry all those zeros

332
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,330
and do all those
zero computations.

333
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,837
In other words, it would
treat K like a dense matrix

334
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,170
and it would just, it wouldn't
know the zeros were there

335
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,420
until it looked.

336
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,840
So I just want to say that if
you have really big systems

337
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,740
sparse MATLAB is the way to go.

338
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,930
Because sparse MATLAB keeps
track only of the non-zeros.

339
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,420
So it knows-- and their
locations, of course.

340
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,970
What the numbers are
and their location.

341
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,790
So I could create a
sparse matrix out of that,

342
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,700
like KS for K sparse.

343
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,620
I think if I just
did sparse(K) that

344
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,400
would create a sparse matrix.

345
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,740
And then if I do
stuff to it, MATLAB

346
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,280
would automatically know
those zeros were there

347
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,620
and not spend it's time
multiplying by zero.

348
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,220
But of course,
this isn't perfect

349
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,960
because I've created the big
matrix before sparsifying it.

350
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,700
And better to have created
it in the first place

351
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,090
as a sparse matrix.

352
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:27,510
Ok.

353
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:32,010
So those were properties
that you could see.

354
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,280
Now I'm looking
for little deeper.

355
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,790
What's the first question I
would ask about a matrix if I

356
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,830
have to solve a
system of equations,

357
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,100
say KU=F or something.

358
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:53,770
I got a 4 by 4 matrix, four
equations, four unknowns.

359
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,070
What would I want to know next?

360
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,780
Is it invertible?

361
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,140
Is the matrix invertible?

362
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,030
And that's an important
question and how

363
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,640
do you recognize an
invertible matrix?

364
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,100
This one is invertible.

365
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,360
So let me say K is invertible.

366
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,110
And what does that mean?

367
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,410
That means that
there's another matrix,

368
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:27,630
K inverse such that K times K
inverse is the identity matrix.

369
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,190
The identity matrix in
MATLAB would be eye(n)

370
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,720
and it's the diagonal
matrix of ones.

371
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,480
It's the unit matrix; it's the
matrix that doesn't do anything

372
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,360
to a vector.

373
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,510
So this K has an inverse.

374
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,910
But how do you know?

375
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,440
How can you recognize that
a matrix is invertible?

376
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,530
Because obviously that's a
critical question and many,

377
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,070
many-- since our
matrices are not--

378
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,030
a random matrix would
be invertible, for sure,

379
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,670
but our matrices have
patterns, they're

380
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,150
created out of a
problem and the question

381
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,850
of whether that matrix is
invertible is fundamental.

382
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,260
I mean finite
elements has these,

383
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,900
zero-energy modes that you have
to watch out for because, what

384
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,580
are they?

385
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,130
They produce non-invertible
stiffness matrix.

386
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:28,670
Ok.

387
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,940
So how did we know,
or how could we

388
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,480
know that this K is invertible?

389
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,640
Somebody said invertible
and I wrote it down.

390
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,600
Yeah?

391
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,880
Well ok.

392
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,080
Now I get to make a
speech about determinants.

393
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,890
Don't deal with them!

394
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,010
Don't touch determinants.

395
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,180
I mean this particular
four by four

396
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,230
happens to have a
nice determinant.

397
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,100
I think it's five.

398
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,480
But if it was a 100
by 100 how would

399
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,900
we show that the
matrix was invertible?

400
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,980
And what I mean by this is the
whole family is invertible.

401
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,650
All sizes are invertible.

402
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,640
K_n is invertible
for every n, not just

403
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,010
this particular guy, whose
determinant we could take.

404
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,370
But as five by
five, six by six, we

405
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:28,100
would be up in the-- but
you're completely right.

406
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,930
The determinant is a test.

407
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,990
Alright.

408
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:45,530
But I guess I'm saying that it's
not the test that I would use.

409
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,180
So what I do?

410
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,540
I would row reduce.

411
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:58,330
That's the default
option in linear algebra.

412
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,660
If you don't know what
to do with a matrix,

413
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,780
if you want to see what's
going on, row reduce.

414
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,910
What does that mean?

415
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,050
That means-- shall I try it?

416
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:15,090
So let me just start it,
just so I'm not using

417
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:24,590
a word that we don't need.

418
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,390
Ok.

419
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,120
And actually, maybe the third
lecture, maybe next Monday

420
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,120
we'll come back to row reduce.

421
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,180
So I won't make heavy weather
of that, certainly not now.

422
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,710
So what is row reduce?

423
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,510
Just so you know.

424
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,880
I want to get that
minus one to be a zero.

425
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,210
I'm aiming for a
triangular matrix.

426
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,960
I want to clean out
below the diagonal

427
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,210
because if my matrix
is triangular then

428
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,560
I can see immediately
everything.

429
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,330
Right?

430
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:06,890
Ultimately I'll reach a matrix
U that'll be upper triangular

431
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,790
and that first row won't change
but the second row will change.

432
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,340
And what does it change to?

433
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,460
How do I clean out, get
a zero in that, where

434
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,930
the minus one is right now?

435
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:29,890
Well I want to use the first
row, the first equation.

436
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:33,330
I want to add some
multiple of the first row

437
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,130
to the second row.

438
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,970
And what should
that multiple be?

439
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,330
I want to multiply
that row by something.

440
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,590
And I'll say "add" today.

441
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,280
Later I'll say "subtract."

442
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,360
But what shall I do?

443
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,130
Just tell me what
the heck to do.

444
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,470
I've got that row
and I want to use it,

445
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,380
I want to take a combination
of these two rows.

446
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,010
This row and some multiple
of this one that'll

447
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,930
produce a zero.

448
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,670
This is called the pivot.

449
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:07,330
That's the first pivot
P-I-V-O-T. Pivot.

450
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:11,290
And then that's the pivot row.

451
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,170
And what do I do?

452
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,930
Tell me what to do.

453
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,180
Add half this row to this one.

454
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,630
When I add half of that row
to that one, what do I get?

455
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,610
I get that zero.

456
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,440
What do I get here
for the second pivot?

457
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,820
What is it?

458
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,690
1.5, 3/2.

459
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,670
Because half of that is, so 3/2.

460
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:39,920
And the rest won't change.

461
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,040
So I'm happy with that zero.

462
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,140
Now I've got a couple more
entries below that first pivot,

463
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,340
but they're already zero.

464
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,070
That's where the
sparseness pays off.

465
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,890
The tridiagonal really pays off.

466
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,410
So those zeros say the
first column is finished.

467
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,670
So I'm ready to go on
to the second column.

468
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:08,560
It's like I got to this smaller
problem with the 3/2 here.

469
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,170
And a zero there.

470
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,870
What do I do now?

471
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,200
There is the second pivot, 3/2.

472
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,720
Below it is a non-zero.

473
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,030
I gotta get rid of it.

474
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,400
What do I multiply by now?

475
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,620
2/3.

476
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,460
2/3 of that new second
row added to the third row

477
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,820
will clean out the third row.

478
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,850
This was already cleaned out.

479
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,590
This is already a zero.

480
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,830
But I want to have 2/3 of
this row added to this one so

481
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,290
what's my new third row?

482
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,990
Starts with zero and
what's the third pivot now?

483
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,870
You see the pivots appearing?

484
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:52,470
The third pivot will be 4/3
because I've got 2/3 this -1

485
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:59,370
and 2 is 6/3 so I have 6/3,
I'm taking 2/3 away, I get 4/3

486
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,770
and that -1 is still there.

487
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:07,060
So you see that
I'm-- this is fast.

488
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,900
This is really fast.

489
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,510
And the next step, maybe you
can see the beautiful patterns

490
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,300
that are coming.

491
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,990
Do you want to just
guess the fourth pivot?

492
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,070
5/4, good guess, right.

493
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,950
5/4.

494
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,880
Now this is actually how MATLAB
would find the determinant.

495
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,660
It would do elimination.

496
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,390
I call that
elimination because it

497
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,850
eliminated all those
numbers below the diagonal

498
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,870
and got zeros.

499
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,510
Now what's the determinant?

500
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,000
If I asked you for
the determinant,

501
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,820
and I will very rarely
use the word determinant,

502
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:55,620
but I guess I'm into it now,
so tell me the determinant.

503
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,020
Five.

504
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,510
Why's that?

505
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,650
I guess I did say five earlier.

506
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:06,420
But how do you know it's five?

507
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,360
Whatever the determinant of
that matrix is, why is it five?

508
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,530
Because it's a
triangular matrix.

509
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:16,660
Triangular matrices,
you've got all these zeros.

510
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,340
You can see what's happening.

511
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,290
And the determinant
of a triangular matrix

512
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,310
is just the product
down the diagonal.

513
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,920
The product of these pivots.

514
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,270
The determinant is the
product of the pivots.

515
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,350
And that's how MATLAB would
compute a determinant.

516
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,890
And it would take 2 times
3/2 times 4/3 times 5/4

517
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,120
and it would give
the answer five.

518
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,540
My friend Alan Edelman told
me something yesterday.

519
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:54,610
MATLAB computes
in floating point.

520
00:28:54,610 --> 00:29:02,960
So 4/3, that's 1.3333, etc.

521
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,660
So MATLAB would not, when
it does that multiplication,

522
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,570
get a whole number.

523
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,900
Right?

524
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,210
Because in MATLAB that
would be 1.333 and probably

525
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,290
it would make that last pivot
a decimal, a long decimal.

526
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:22,560
And then when it multiplies
that it gets whatever it gets.

527
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,400
But it's not exactly
five I think.

528
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,110
Nevertheless MATLAB will
print the answer five.

529
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,910
It's cheated actually.

530
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,510
It's done that
calculation and I don't

531
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,520
know if it takes the
nearest integer when

532
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,080
it knows that the-- I
shouldn't tell you this,

533
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,320
this isn't even interesting.

534
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,950
If the determinant of an
integer matrix, whole number

535
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,230
is a whole number,
so MATLAB says,

536
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,680
better get a whole number.

537
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,060
And somehow it gets one.

538
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,240
Actually, it doesn't
always get the right one.

539
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:09,670
So maybe later I'll know
the matrix whose determinant

540
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,530
might not come out right.

541
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,170
But ours is right, five.

542
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:19,700
Now where was this going?

543
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,420
It got thrown off track
by the determinant.

544
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,370
What's the real test?

545
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,830
Well so I said there
are two ways to see

546
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,690
that a matrix is invertible.

547
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,160
Or not invertible.

548
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,990
Here we're talking
about the first way.

549
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:39,130
How do I know that this matrix--
I've got an upper triangular

550
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:39,730
matrix.

551
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,650
When is it invertible?

552
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:47,310
When is an upper triangular
matrix invertible?

553
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,502
Upper triangular is great.

554
00:30:48,502 --> 00:30:49,960
When you've got it
in that form you

555
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,890
should be able to see stuff.

556
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,070
So this key question
of invertible,

557
00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:03,470
which is not obvious
for a typical matrix

558
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,000
is obvious for a
triangular matrix.

559
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,780
And why?

560
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,180
What's the test?

561
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,630
Well, we could do
the determinant

562
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,330
but we can say it without
using that long word.

563
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,730
The diagonal is non-zero.

564
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,340
K as invertible because
the diagonal-- no,

565
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,550
it's got a full set of pivots.

566
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,810
It's got four non-zero pivots.

567
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,110
That's what it takes.

568
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,080
That's what it's going
to take to solve systems.

569
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,880
So this is the first step
in solving this system.

570
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,290
In other words, to decide
if a matrix is invertible,

571
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,150
you just go ahead and use it.

572
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:46,080
You don't stop first necessarily
to check invertibility.

573
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,320
You go forward, you
get to this point

574
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,070
and you see non-zeros
there and then

575
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,800
you're practically got
to the answer here.

576
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:01,530
I'll leave for another day the
final back-- going back upwards

577
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,760
that gives you the answer.

578
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,270
So K is invertible.

579
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:15,160
That means full set of
pivots. n non-zero pivots.

580
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:20,260
And here they are,
two, 3/2, 4/3 and 5/4.

581
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,270
Worth knowing because this
matrix K is so important.

582
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,750
We'll see it over
and over again.

583
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:30,950
Part of my purpose today
is to give some matrices

584
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,380
a name because we'll see them
again and you'll know them

585
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,640
and you'll recognize them.

586
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,900
While I'm on this invertible
or not invertible business

587
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:52,020
I want to ask you to change
K. To make it not invertible.

588
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,650
Change that matrix.

589
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,710
How could I change that matrix?

590
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,430
Well, of course, many ways.

591
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,950
But I'm interested
in another matrix

592
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,880
and this'll be among
my special matrices.

593
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,660
And it will start out the same.

594
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:14,560
It'll have these same diagonals.

595
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,900
It'll be Toeplitz.

596
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,600
I'm going to call
it C and I want

597
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,600
to say the reason I'm talking
about it now is that it's not

598
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,200
going to be invertible.

599
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:38,150
And I'm going to tell you a
C and see if you can tell me

600
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,320
why it is not invertible.

601
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,270
So here's the difference:
I'm going to put minus one

602
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,230
in the corners.

603
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:49,880
Still zeros there.

604
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:56,180
So that matrix C still
has that pattern.

605
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,740
It's still a Toeplitz
matrix, actually.

606
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:07,970
That would still be the matrix
Toeplitz of 2, -1, 0, -1.

607
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,440
I claim that matrix
is not invertible

608
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,700
and I claim that we can see that
without computing determinants,

609
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,290
we can see it without
doing elimination, too.

610
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,380
MATLAB would see it
by doing elimination.

611
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:30,720
We can see it by just
human intelligence.

612
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,720
Now why?

613
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:39,110
How do I recognize a matrix
that's not invertible?

614
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:44,450
And then, by converse, how
a matrix that is invertible.

615
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,690
I claim-- and let
may say first, let

616
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:56,830
me say why that letter C. That
letter C stands for circulant.

617
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:02,010
It's because-- This word
circulant, why circulant,

618
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,520
it's because that diagonal
which only had three guys

619
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,060
circled around to the fourth.

620
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,370
This diagonal that
only had three entries

621
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,070
circled around to
the fourth entry.

622
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,740
This diagonal with two
zeros circled around

623
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,840
to the other two zeros.

624
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,550
The diagonal are not only
constant, they loop around.

625
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,790
And you use the word periodic.

626
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:29,460
Now for me, that's
the periodic matrix.

627
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:35,140
See, a circulant matrix comes
from a periodic problem.

628
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,180
Because it loops around.

629
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,970
It brings numbers,
zero is the same

630
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,400
as number four or something.

631
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,320
And why is that not invertible?

632
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,570
The thing is can
you find a vector?

633
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,100
Because matrices
multiply vectors,

634
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,140
that's their whole point.

635
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,060
Can you see a vector
that it takes to zero?

636
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,520
Can you see a solution to Cu=0?

637
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,990
I'm looking for a
u with four entries

638
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:18,680
so that I get four zeros.

639
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,810
Do you see it?

640
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:21,990
All ones.

641
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,710
All ones.

642
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,460
That will do it.

643
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:33,230
So that's a nice, natural
entry, a constant.

644
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:37,360
And do you see why
when I-- we haven't

645
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,170
spoken about multiplying
matrices times vectors.

646
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,010
And most people
will do it this way.

647
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,280
And let's do this one this way.

648
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,142
You take row one times that,
you get two, minus one, zero,

649
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:51,020
minus one.

650
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,730
You get the zero because
of that new number.

651
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:58,920
Here we always got zero from
the all ones vector and now

652
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,190
over here that minus one,
you see it's just right.

653
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:09,290
If all the rows add to zero
then this vector of all ones

654
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:14,110
will be, I would use the
word "in the null space"

655
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:18,280
if you wanted a fancy word,
a linear algebra word.

656
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,390
What does that mean?

657
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,330
It solves Cu=0.

658
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:24,770


659
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:29,080
And why does that show that
the matrix isn't invertible?

660
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,340
Because that's our point here.

661
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,210
I have a solution to Cu=0.

662
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:39,050
I claim that the existence
of such a solution

663
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:45,210
has wiped out the possibility
that the matrix is invertible

664
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,120
because if it was invertible,
what would this lead to?

665
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:55,850
If invertible, if C
inverse exists what would

666
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:01,760
I do to that equation
that would show me

667
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,360
that C inverse can't exist?

668
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,480
Multiply both
sides by C inverse.

669
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,230
So you're seeing, just
this first day you're

670
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,330
seeing some of the natural
steps of linear algebra.

671
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,140
Row reduction,
multiply-- when you

672
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,530
want to see what's happening,
multiply both sides

673
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,460
by C inverse.

674
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,330
That's the same as
in ordinary language,

675
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,330
do the same thing to
all the equations.

676
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,100
So I multiply both sides
by the same matrix.

677
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,670
And here I would get
C^(-1) C u = C^(-1) 0.

678
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,050


679
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:40,190
So what does that tell me?

680
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,970
I made it long, I threw
in this extra step.

681
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:51,350
You were going to jump
immediately to C^(-1) C is I,

682
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:54,540
is the identity matrix and when
the identity matrix multiplies

683
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,780
a vector u, you get u.

684
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,700
And on the right
side, C inverse,

685
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,290
whatever it is, if it
existed, times zero

686
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,160
would have to be zero.

687
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,380
So this would say that
if C inverse exists,

688
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,020
then the only solution
is u equals zero.

689
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,660
That's a good way to
recognize invertible matrices.

690
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:21,770
If it is invertible then the
only solution to Cu=0 is u=0.

691
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,620
And that wasn't true here.

692
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,160
So we conclude C
is not invertible.

693
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,400
C is therefore not invertible.

694
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,040
Now can I even jump in.

695
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,800
I've got two more
matrices that I

696
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,250
want to tell you about that are
also close cousins of K and C.

697
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:50,250
But let me just explain
physically a little bit

698
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:54,050
about where these
matrices are coming from.

699
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:59,760
So maybe next to K-- so I'm not
going to put periodic there.

700
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,570
Right?

701
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,770
That's the one that I
would call periodic.

702
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:08,450
This one is fixed at the ends.

703
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:13,760
Can I draw a little picture
that aims to show that?

704
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,730
Aims to show where
this is coming from.

705
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,610
It's coming from I think
of this as controlling

706
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,990
like four masses.

707
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:27,660
Mass one, mass two,
mass three and mass four

708
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:40,390
with springs attached
and with endpoints fixed.

709
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:47,290
So if I put some weights on
those masses-- we'll do this;

710
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:51,750
masses and springs is going to
be the very first application

711
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,370
and it will connect
to all these matrices.

712
00:40:55,370 --> 00:41:05,050
And all I'm doing now is just
asking to draw the system.

713
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,490
Draw the mechanical system.

714
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,950
Actually I'll usually
draw it vertically.

715
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:14,580
But anyway, it's got
four masses and the fact

716
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,250
that this minus one
here got chopped off,

717
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,820
what would I call that end?

718
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,830
I'd call that a fixed end.

719
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:25,910
So this is a fixed,
fixed matrix.

720
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,560
Both ends are fixed.

721
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,620
And it's the matrix
that would govern--

722
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,270
and the springs and
masses all the same

723
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:38,530
is what tells me that
the thing is Toeplitz.

724
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:42,970
Now what's the picture
that goes with C?

725
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,680
What's the picture with C?

726
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,520
Do you have an instinct of that?

727
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,080
So C is periodic.

728
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,440
So again we've got four
masses connected by springs.

729
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,210
But what's up with those masses
to make the problem cyclic,

730
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,140
periodic, circular,
whatever word you like.

731
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:13,190
They're arranged in a ring.

732
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:16,450
The fourth guy comes
back to the first one.

733
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:22,120
So the four masses would be,
so in some kind of a ring,

734
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:27,500
the springs would connect them.

735
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,940
I don't know if that's
suggestive, but I hope so.

736
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,990
And what's the point
of, can we just

737
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,530
speak about
mechanics one moment?

738
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:46,080
How does that system differ
from this fixed system?

739
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:53,340
Here the whole system
can't move, right?

740
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,880
If there no force, then
nothing can happen.

741
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,560
Here the whole system can turn.

742
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,750
They can all displace
the same amount

743
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,760
and just turn without any
compression of the springs,

744
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,890
without any force
having to do anything.

745
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:13,280
And that's why the solution
that kills this matrix is

746
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,050
[1, 1, 1, 1].

747
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:19,360
So [1, 1, 1, 1] would
describe a case where all

748
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,840
the displacements were equal.

749
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,940
In a way it's like the
arbitrary constant in calculus.

750
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:30,250
You're always adding
plus C. So here we've

751
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:36,350
got a solution of all ones
that produces zero the way

752
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:41,610
the derivative of a constant
function is the zero function.

753
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:49,550
So this is just
like an indication.

754
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,090
Yes, perfect.

755
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,750
I've got two more matrices.

756
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:58,770
Are you okay for two more?

757
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:03,810
Yes okay, what are they?

758
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:10,110
Okay a different blackboard
for the last two.

759
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:17,640
So one of them is going to
come by freeing up this end.

760
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:24,580
So I'm going to take
that support away.

761
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,980
And you might imagine like a
tower oscillating up and down

762
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:34,020
or you might turn it upside
down and like a hanging spring,

763
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:39,160
or rather four springs with
four masses hanging onto them.

764
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,470
But this end is fixed and
this is not fixed anymore,

765
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:46,160
this is now free.

766
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,590
And can I tell you the
matrix, the free-fixed matrix.

767
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:53,590
Free-fixed.

768
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,370
Because it's the top
end that I changed,

769
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:59,680
I'm going to call it T.
So all the other guys

770
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:11,340
are going to be the same but
the top one, the top row,

771
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,230
the boundary row,
boundary conditions

772
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:17,870
are always the tough
part, the tricky part,

773
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:20,950
the key part of
a model, and here

774
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,120
the natural boundary condition
is to have a 1 there.

775
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:34,610
That two changed to a one.

776
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,900
Now if I asked you for the
properties of that matrix--

777
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,010
so that's the third.
shall I do the fourth one?

778
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:44,480
So you have them all, you'll
have the whole picture.

779
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,940
The fourth one,
well you can guess.

780
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,950
What's the fourth?

781
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,470
What am I going to do?

782
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:53,380
Free up the other end.

783
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:59,420
So this guy had one free
end and the other guy

784
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,570
has B for both ends.

785
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:04,050
B for both ends are
going to be free.

786
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,840
So this is free-fixed.

787
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,930
This'll be free-free.

788
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:12,240
So that means I
have this free end,

789
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,010
the usual stuff in
the middle, no change,

790
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:23,510
and the last row is what?

791
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:27,560
What am I going to put
in the last row? -1, 1.

792
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,160
-1, 1.

793
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:34,740
So I've changed the diagonal.

794
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,150
There I put a single one in
because I freed up one end.

795
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:41,900
With B I freed both ends
and I got two minus ones.

796
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,420
Now what do you think?

797
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:52,860
So we've drawn the free-fixed
one and what's your guess?

798
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,320
They're all symmetric.

799
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,200
That's no accident.

800
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,690
They're all tridiagonal,
no accident again.

801
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,210
Why are they tridiagonal?

802
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:06,020
Physically they're tridiagonal
because that mass is only

803
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,890
connected to its
two neighbors, it's

804
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,940
not connected to that mass.

805
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:16,390
That's why we get a zero
in the two, four position.

806
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:19,180
Because two is not
connected to four.

807
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,920
So it's tridiagonal.

808
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,030
And it's not Toeplitz
anymore, right?

809
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:27,720
Toeplitz says constant
diagonals and these are not

810
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,310
quite constant.

811
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:33,990
I would create K, I
would take T equal K,

812
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,830
if I was going to create this
matrix and then I would say

813
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:37,330
T(1, 1) = 1.

814
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,060


815
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:49,020
That command would fix
up the first entry.

816
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,580
Yeah, that's a serious question.

817
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:53,730
Maybe, can I hang on
until Friday, and even

818
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:54,710
maybe next week.

819
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,310
Because it's very important.

820
00:47:56,310 --> 00:48:00,980
When I said boundary conditions
are the key to problems,

821
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,760
I'm serious.

822
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,790
If I had to think okay, what
do people come in my office

823
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,780
ask about questions,
I say right away,

824
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,030
what's the boundary condition?

825
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:12,910
Because I know that's
where the problem is.

826
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:16,910
And so here we'll see
these guys clearly.

827
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:23,360
Fixed and free, very important.

828
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,330
But also let me say two more
words, I never can resist.

829
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:30,510
So fixed means the
displacement is zero.

830
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,790
Something was set to zero.

831
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:36,540
The fifth guy, the fifth over
here, that fifth column was

832
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,270
knocked out.

833
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:47,300
Free means that in here it
could mean that the fifth guy is

834
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,450
the same as the fourth.

835
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:52,080
The slope is zero.

836
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,760
Fixed is u is zero.

837
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,010
Free is slope is zero.

838
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:04,710
So here I have a slope
of zero at that end,

839
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,960
here I have it at both ends.

840
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,440
So maybe that's a
sort of part answer.

841
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,640
Now I wanted to get to the
difference between these two

842
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,140
matrices.

843
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:19,030
And the main properties.

844
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,960
So what are we see?

845
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,210
Symmetric again,
tridiagonal again,

846
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:27,760
not quite Toeplitz, but almost,
sort of morally Toeplitz.

847
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,590
But then the key question
was invertible or not.

848
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:34,590
Key question was
invertible or not.

849
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:35,090
Right.

850
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:37,680
And what's your
guess on these two?

851
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,030
Do you think that one's
invertible or not?

852
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,770
Make a guess.

853
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:46,140
You're allowed to guess.

854
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,550
Yeah it is.

855
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:48,460
Why's that?

856
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:52,740
Because this thing has
still got a support.

857
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,260
It's not free to shift forever.

858
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,860
It's held in there.

859
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:01,020
So that gives you a
hint about this guy.

860
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,890
Invertible or not for B?

861
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:06,210
No.

862
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:09,780
And now prove that it's not.

863
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,800
Physically you were
saying, well this free guy

864
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:19,640
with this thing gone now,
this is now free-free.

865
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,710
Physically we're saying
the whole thing can move,

866
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,130
there's nothing holding it.

867
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,680
But now, for linear algebra,
that's not the proper language.

868
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,040
You have to say something
about that matrix.

869
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,010
Maybe tell me
something about Bu=0.

870
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:36,820


871
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,950
What are you going
to take for u?

872
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:39,770
Yeah.

873
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,420
Same u.

874
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:46,740
We're lucky in this course, u =
[1, 1, 1, 1] is the guilty main

875
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,800
vector many times.

876
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:55,090
Because again the rows are all
adding to zero and the all ones

877
00:50:55,090 --> 00:51:02,360
vector is in the null space.

878
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,200
If I could just close
with one more word.

879
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,810
Because it's the most important.

880
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:10,160
Two words, two words.

881
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,890
Because they're the
most important words,

882
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:15,200
they're the words that we're
leading to in this chapter.

883
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,770
And I'm assuming that for most
people they will be new words,

884
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,480
but not for all.

885
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,290
It's a further property
of this matrix.

886
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,380
So we've got, how many?

887
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,630
Four properties, or five?

888
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,900
I'm going to go for one more.

889
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,680
And I'm just going to
say that name first

890
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,400
so you know it's coming.

891
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,110
And then I'll say,
I can't resist

892
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:41,110
saying a tiny bit about it.

893
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:45,980
I'll use a whole
blackboard for this.

894
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:54,530
So I'm going to say that K
and T are -- here it comes,

895
00:51:54,530 --> 00:52:07,690
take a breath -- positive
definite matrices.

896
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:10,390
So if you don't know what
that means, I'm happy.

897
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:10,890
Right?

898
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:13,420
Because well, I can
tell you one way

899
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:16,830
to recognize a positive
definite matrix.

900
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:21,190
And while we're at it, let
me tell you about C and B.

901
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:32,160
Those are positive semi-definite
because they hit zero somehow.

902
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,830
Positive means up there,
greater than zero.

903
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:40,270
And what is greater than
zero that we've already seen?

904
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,900
And we'll say more.

905
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,550
The pivots were.

906
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:50,620
So if I have a symmetric matrix
and the pivots are all positive

907
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:54,700
then that matrix is not
only invertible, because I'm

908
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,920
in good shape, the
determinant isn't zero,

909
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,690
I can go backwards
and do everything,

910
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:04,540
those positive numbers are
telling me that more than that,

911
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:07,810
the matrix is positive definite.

912
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,240
So that's a test.

913
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,500
We'll say more about
positive definite,

914
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,760
but one way to recognize
it is compute the pivots

915
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,930
by elimination.

916
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:20,630
Are they positive?

917
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,980
We'll see that all the
eigenvalues are positive.

918
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,520
The word positive definite
just brings the whole

919
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,740
of linear algebra together.

920
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:33,440
It connects to pivots, it
connects to eigenvalues,

921
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,530
it connects to least squares,
it's all over the place.

922
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,790
Determinants too.

923
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,050
Questions or discussion.

924
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,970
It's a big class and we're
just meeting for the first time

925
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:49,740
but there's lots of time
to, chance to ask me.

926
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,590
I'll always be here after class.

927
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:53,760
So shall we stop today?

928
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,890
I'll see you Friday
or this afternoon.

929
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:03,710
If this wasn't familiar, this
afternoon would be a good idea.

930
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,220
Thank you.
