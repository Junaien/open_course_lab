6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,900
PROFESSOR: OK, so
I'll start with this.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,150
This is a method for a
particular class of problem

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,490
and maybe moving
interfaces, moving curves,

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,010
curves that are -- or
surfaces, in higher dimensions,

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:40,910
that are being transported, and
it's their shape that matters.

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:48,010
So it's a sort of topic within
shape differential equations

12
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,970
rather than particle
differential equations.

13
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:57,600
And some cases of
this problem can

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,500
be studied by a
particularly fast method,

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,490
developed here at
MIT in Course 6

16
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,730
actually, called the
fast marching method.

17
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,940
It's really thanks
to Per-Olof Persson

18
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,400
that there's now quite a
bit on the 18.086 web page.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,770
The basic equations that'll
be in the lecture and also

20
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,450
demonstrations, quick
demos that show the point.

21
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:34,790
And I better mention Sethian
and Osher, who jointly proposed

22
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:41,760
the method, conceived of this
approach in the late '80s,

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,990
and each has written a
book, or coauthored a book,

24
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,410
on the level set method.

25
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,320
So those books are, so to speak,
the authorities on the method.

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,040
OK, so what's the idea?

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:04,040
Well, here is the
curve, the shape,

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,760
the interface that's moving.

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,800
And let's suppose -- well,
imagine it's sort of --

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,660
there's a wall pf fire here,
and think of it as a moving fire

31
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,970
front.

32
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:26,100
Then that fire front will
move, normal to itself,

33
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,780
to some later
position at time 1.

34
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:38,480
We could normalize -- in
a perfect case when it was

35
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,050
homogeneous and the speed of
movement didn't change with

36
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,550
position, we could imagine
that the speed is 1.

37
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,020
So where is this fire
front here at time 1?

38
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,050
It contains all
the points that are

39
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,710
reached from the initial
fire in unit time.

40
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,110
And since we're
going at speed 1,

41
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:11,820
let's say, this is all
the points at distance 1.

42
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,210
This curve, in this
best, simplest case,

43
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,020
will be the curve
that's everywhere

44
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,050
a distance 1 away
from this curve.

45
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,350
Now, how to describe the
curves is the key point here.

46
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:35,910
Shall I describe the
curve by particles?

47
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,800
I could imagine
these points as being

48
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,470
my unknowns, my positions, and
some equation for following

49
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,340
them.

50
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,410
So I follow those -- ordinary
differential equations,

51
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:58,760
one for every point -- and they
reach new positions at time 1.

52
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:05,970
And then I interpolate the next
curve, the new curve at time 1.

53
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,090
Well, that's not what we do.

54
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,340
That's not the idea of
the level set method,

55
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,280
and I'll explain why that
idea of following particles,

56
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,760
which is a totally natural one,
comes to grief, numerically,

57
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,340
too often.

58
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,750
This picture, of course,
was like an ideal case,

59
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:37,270
and the particles separated a
little bit, but not too much.

60
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,290
Just to say in a word, the
trouble with the particle idea

61
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,240
is that particles
could separate wildly,

62
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,570
so you had a big, big gap
to fill in, like a fan.

63
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,600
Or they could come very close
together so that you had

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,040
total instability numerically.

65
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,850
You couldn't compute
any differences

66
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,170
because the distance
was too small,

67
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,970
and that would be like a shock.

68
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,070
So we're really connecting
this type of problem.

69
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,070
It connects well with
the conservation laws

70
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,540
that we've been studying.

71
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,650
Fans and shocks appear, and
I'll show you right away.

72
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,500
Can I just say, what
is the approach?

73
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,080
What does this word
"level set" mean?

74
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,530
Well, the level set
of a function --

75
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,980
I'm saying what this
word level set is,

76
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,520
and that's going to be the
way the curve is described,

77
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,810
sort of implicitly.

78
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,340
Instead of saying
where the points are

79
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,580
that are on the
curve, the curve is

80
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:42,570
being given by an equation
like phi of x, y equals 0,

81
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,470
or phi of x, y equal 1,
or phi of x, y equals 7.

82
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:53,870
Those three curves would
be level sets of phi.

83
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,270
Do you see the idea
of levels sets?

84
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,760
They're the solutions
to the equation

85
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,480
phi of x, y equal constant.

86
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:08,220
Let me take a simple example
here on the board that I can --

87
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,370
so the idea of level
sets, first of all.

88
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,840
Let me take an easy -- a
particularly nice function.

89
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,200
phi of x, y equals, say,
x squared plus y squared.

90
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,660
OK, so I want to ask,
what are the level

91
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,980
sets of that function?

92
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:36,550
So I set phi of x, y equals a
constant, to get the c level

93
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,360
set, you could say.

94
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,920
And, of course,
we recognize that

95
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,580
as a circle when c is
positive, and there

96
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,970
is no set when c is negative.

97
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,360
So this would be -- the
level sets would be circles.

98
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,590
So that would be
one description.

99
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,690
I mean, what we're
really doing is

100
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:09,930
we're introducing a new
dimension to the problem.

101
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,940
Here, it's a 2D problem
with x square and y squared,

102
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,860
but I'm bringing in
the third dimension, z,

103
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,310
and thinking of the curve in
the xy-plane as being produced

104
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,290
by -- so what would be the graph
of z equals x squared plus y

105
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:29,790
squared?

106
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,530
That's some surface now in 3D.

107
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:40,390
So I have x, y, and now I've
introduced this third dimension

108
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,880
in order to see a whole surface.

109
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,160
And now I cut that surface
by the plane z equal to c.

110
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:56,280
So z equal to c cuts through
that surface by a plane here.

111
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,030
And that cuts out
a circle, which

112
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:05,180
I can drop down to the xy-plane
if I want to see it down there,

113
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,500
and that's the level
set at height c.

114
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,690
So that's a way to describe
the curve, but it's sort of --

115
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,950
it's implicit.

116
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,780
You'll see that it has
major advantages when --

117
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,250
maybe I can just describe
them without drawing them.

118
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:36,820
Suppose I have a
problem with two fires,

119
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,560
say, two circles
of fire, spreading.

120
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,380
What's going to happen,
as time evolves,

121
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,470
with these two circles of fire?

122
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,490
Well, having taken circles,
they're just going to expand,

123
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,350
so after a little time,
I've got two bigger circles.

124
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,790
But after a little
more time, the circles

125
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,110
will meet and form
one non-circle, right?

126
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:09,360
A sort of figure-eight shape.

127
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,260
Now that's a change in
topology, and the world

128
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,420
of shape calculations
is always having

129
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,450
to ask, how am I going to
deal with changes in topology

130
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,340
when curves meet, when
unconnected things become

131
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,740
connected, or when
connected things disconnect?

132
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,495
And the one great value
of the level set approach

133
00:09:32,495 --> 00:09:35,860
is it deals with that easily.

134
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,930
I could imagine a double -- so
I don't know that I'll succeed

135
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:47,500
to do it here, but I could
imagine a function, which --

136
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,100
OK, maybe this example,
this picture, isn't too bad.

137
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,620
So that's intended
to be a surface.

138
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,950
Well, let me make the
surface go up that way.

139
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,210
OK, so when I cut
it at z equals c,

140
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:08,320
that might cut the surface
in two different planes.

141
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,190
So the level set at a
certain level is two circles.

142
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,740
There's two circles.

143
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,550
But now, let z increase,
and what happens?

144
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,280
You see how naturally,
as z increases,

145
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,550
these two circles are
coming closer and closer,

146
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,980
and at a certain
point, they merge.

147
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,200
And phi of x and y remains
a totally nice function.

148
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,030
I mean, I could create some
probably fourth-degree function

149
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,500
curve that would do that fine.

150
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,730
I could graph it.

151
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,500
I could visualize it.

152
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,430
And the point is that by
going up that one dimension

153
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,580
and then slicing at
different levels,

154
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,070
you allow these things
to happen smoothly.

155
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,300
OK, so that's one feature of
level sets, that description.

156
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,170
OK, so that's the way curves
are going to be defined.

157
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,280
So our unknown
becomes this function,

158
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,920
which will become a
function of x, y, and t

159
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,840
with some initial condition.

160
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:24,390
OK, so now, let me
evolve the curve.

161
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,010
Well, OK, yeah, let
me evolve a curve.

162
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:35,470
So we already took the case
of a circle, which just grows,

163
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,040
and that's a piece of it.

164
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,780
Let me do a couple more
example so that you see --

165
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,430
how does a corner evolve?

166
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,250
Suppose that's at t equals
0, we have a corner.

167
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,980
We have sort of a fire in
here, and it's growing outward.

168
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,010
And we're looking for all
the points at distance 1

169
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,980
from this curve.

170
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,370
This is our curve at time 0.

171
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,370
OK, what do the points
look like at time 1?

172
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,210
Well, these points here
will certainly be a distance

173
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,050
1 away from our curve.

174
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,930
These points here will be a
distance 1 away from our curve.

175
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,820
But then there's a little
circular arc, right --

176
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,780
maybe I should make
that dashed line, too --

177
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:34,770
which are additional
points at distance 1.

178
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:41,490
So in this case, the evolving
curve has smoothed out.

179
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:48,110
That corner, which we might
describe as a jump in the slope

180
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:54,800
if we were thinking about jumps
from the last week's topic,

181
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,770
has -- well, I guess
I'd use the word fan.

182
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:05,280
That jump in slope has -- sort
of the characteristics or some

183
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:12,520
key lines here, and here was an
area where none of these lines

184
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,100
are matching, but we
have distance 1 still.

185
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:27,630
Somehow, the equation is --
the slope is becoming smooth,

186
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,830
which it wasn't initially.

187
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,610
Now the opposite
could also happen.

188
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:41,360
A corner could appear
from a smooth start.

189
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,000
So that would correspond,
of course, in our thinking.

190
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,780
We immediately
think, oh, we started

191
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,460
with something smooth,
evolved for a little while,

192
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,930
and a shock appeared.

193
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,740
So a shock would
correspond to the --

194
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,450
it's a shock in the
slope, so to speak.

195
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,200
So the curve itself
will be continuous.

196
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,020
Let me take it -- well, let
me just take it straight.

197
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,860
I mean -- oops!

198
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,000
Well, I was hoping
to make it tangent,

199
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,580
so let me make it more obviously
tangent, so a little --

200
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,670
maybe an arc of a
circle or something,

201
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,890
and then straight again, just
as a model that you can see

202
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,400
what's happening.

203
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,080
OK, what will happen now?

204
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,920
So that's again t equals 0.

205
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:36,320
So that, you see, has
-- these are now --

206
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,700
the fire is moving
normal to the surface,

207
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,690
normal to the fire front.

208
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,740
And you see what happens now
is, after a certain time,

209
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:55,980
say t equal to 1, we're going
to have a corner appear.

210
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:03,820
This'll get steeper and steeper.

211
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,970
The slope will change
faster and faster.

212
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,810
Here it takes a little while
to change from that slope.

213
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,130
It curves around and
slowly gets to that slope.

214
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,070
But that is going to get
squeezed in as we move forward

215
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,530
in time and -- well, it's
essentially time running

216
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,780
in the opposite
direction from this box.

217
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,550
So this would be at t
equal to 1, with a corner.

218
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:39,840
OK, and maybe those examples
will explain why the idea

219
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:46,400
of a particle method isn't great
because if we put particles --

220
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,760
I'll just say that again.

221
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,430
If we tried to
follow this, which

222
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,200
would be a completely
natural idea in discretizing

223
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,180
the differential problem, would
be to follow particles there.

224
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:06,000
They travel perpendicular
to the fire.

225
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,070
They reach here and here,
but nobody reaches there,

226
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,520
so we don't have any
information there.

227
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,920
And if we did try the
particle method here,

228
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:24,080
we'd have a bunch of particles
that start following the law

229
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,590
of moving -- well, we have to
figure out where the tangent

230
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,701
direction is, and perpendicular
to that is the normal

231
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:32,200
direction.

232
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,970
The particles move
along, and you

233
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,595
see that all these
particles are going

234
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:40,850
to be really close together
after a little time,

235
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,460
and then there, they meet.

236
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,340
So the particle method
just basically fails

237
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,180
on a problem like this.

238
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,570
On a problem that stays
beautiful and smooth and keeps

239
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,460
it shape, probably
the particle --

240
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,670
the following ordinary
differential equation for each

241
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,430
particle and then interpolating
to find a curve is reasonable.

242
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,790
But level set method
is a different way.

243
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:17,510
OK, so let me stay with the
level set idea, which involves,

244
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:25,990
of course, remembering if
this is the curve phi of x, y

245
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,990
equals 0, then the
normal direction

246
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,510
is the same direction
as the gradient.

247
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,680
I mean, that's the
one bit of calculus

248
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,370
that we absolutely need, is
that the gradient of a function

249
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,020
points in the normal direction.

250
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,920
And if we want a unit vector
n, the unit normal vector,

251
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,280
we have to divide by its length.

252
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:57,930
So that's the basic formula
from calculus of two variables.

253
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,980
And then there's a
special case of a function

254
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,840
when the gradient is 1.

255
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,950
So we have -- that
formula simplifies

256
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,310
because the denominator is
just a 1 for these functions.

257
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,190
OK, so these are
distance functions.

258
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,690
Functions with
gradient everywhere 1

259
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:21,050
are kind of special and
nice, very special and nice.

260
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,860
And I guess that
if everything is --

261
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,960
so I spoke about
distance function here.

262
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,880
So I allowed myself to take --
to imagine that the function

263
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,280
phi was the distance, that
everything was traveling with

264
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,330
speed F equal 1.

265
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:43,250
So let me introduce that
letter F for the speed,

266
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,420
and in this case, it's 1.

267
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:51,620
So at time t -- the function
that gives the distance has

268
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,310
gradient 1.

269
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,570
Maybe an example would serve.

270
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:59,250
Let me go back to
this circle here.

271
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:06,630
OK, suppose these are my -- I'm
not doing this tricky case with

272
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,160
two circles, but just
back to a single circle.

273
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:18,000
So if I take the gradient
of that function, I get --

274
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,380
it's a vector, right?

275
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,910
The x-derivative and then the
y-derivative, it's 2x and 2y.

276
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,980
And that's a vector
with some magnitude.

277
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,890
Probably the
magnitude is about 2r,

278
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,310
the distance from the center.

279
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,170
It's not 1.

280
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,320
This is not a distance function.

281
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,510
The distance function that
has the same level curves

282
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,260
but has gradient
equal 1 would just

283
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,850
be the square root of x
squared plus y squared.

284
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,430
That's a distance.

285
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,930
OK, so that distance
function -- say,

286
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,070
and let me measure
distance from the center.

287
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,390
OK, so the distance
from the origin

288
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,480
is 0, when x and y are 0.

289
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,840
I claim that this
distance function is --

290
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,080
that that function is this
perfect kind for the level set

291
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,400
method where its level sets
are still those same circles,

292
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,140
but the gradient of that
thing, the gradient of this --

293
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,860
of course, this is just r.

294
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,545
And the gradient of it, if I
take the x-derivative of this

295
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:35,970
-- so let me take the
gradient of the distance,

296
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,940
just in case you were really
remembering what we easily

297
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:48,340
mastered in calculus
of several variables.

298
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,740
The x-derivative of
that is, well, I get 2x,

299
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,770
and then I get a half
from the square root,

300
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,970
and then the square root
goes in the denominator.

301
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:03,990
So that's just x over r, x over
the square root, if you like.

302
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,980
x over the square root
is the first component.

303
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,760
That's the x-derivative.

304
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,980
The y-derivative of this
is 2y from the chain rule,

305
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:21,080
and then the whole square
root produces 1/2 square root

306
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,630
to the -- square root
in the denominator.

307
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:28,400
In other words, it produces
y over the square root.

308
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,520
And sure enough -- so that's
the gradient and sure enough,

309
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:39,090
if I take its magnitude, I take
this squared plus this squared,

310
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,660
square root, but I get 1.

311
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,420
OK, so distance functions
are the good ones.

312
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,190
So in working with
the level set method,

313
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:59,110
we will follow equations,
numerically, of course,

314
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,050
and phi of x and y
might start out --

315
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:08,820
phi of x and y and 0 might
be a distance function,

316
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,670
but later on in time
after we've followed phi,

317
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,900
it probably changes from
a distance function.

318
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,330
And if it changes a lot, if its
gradient is getting out of hand

319
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:27,220
-- for example, the gradient
of this is getting bigger.

320
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:36,980
And after a while, we can
stop, reinitialize to make

321
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,790
the gradient 1 again.

322
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,210
Effectively, we would come back
to this function and proceed.

323
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:51,220
So this reinitialization is part
of the numerical computation

324
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,060
that I won't say more about.

325
00:22:53,060 --> 00:23:00,170
Really what I now have to do
is say what's the key equation?

326
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,000
What's the equation that we
solve numerically in x, y, t?

327
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,050
Remember, it's going to be a
partial differential equation.

328
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,040
OK, so first we
have to know what's

329
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,360
the rule for the
evolution of a curve.

330
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,710
So this decides the
movement of the curve.

331
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:30,640
This decides the movement
of the curve, this velocity

332
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,877
vector, velocity field,
velocity vector, v, (v_1, v_2).

333
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:37,460
It's a vector.

334
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,680
All right, then
the neat thing is

335
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:51,810
that we get, by using this level
set description of the curve,

336
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,750
to this equation.

337
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,470
The convection
equation, you could say.

338
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,230
It's like our one-way
wave equation.

339
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,950
If v is a constant,
it's just our equation,

340
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,740
but now we're in
two space dimensions

341
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,760
instead, where before,
we were just in one.

342
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,990
But if v is not a constant,
then, for example,

343
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,860
v may depend on phi.

344
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,230
The velocity might
depend, and it often

345
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:29,010
does depend on the curvature of
phi in some nonlinear problem,

346
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,000
then our equation
becomes nonlinear,

347
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,880
but it still has a nice form.

348
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,280
So that expresses exactly what
our thinking is that the level

349
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,440
sets -- that the function,
the evolution of the function,

350
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,410
tells us how the level sets
evolve, and then, at any time,

351
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:55,760
we read off the position of
the curve from the level set.

352
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,440
And then one more
step to that equation,

353
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,550
which is often easier
computationally than this one.

354
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:09,300
So I'm going to take a
simple step between there

355
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:22,270
and there in the case when v
is in the normal direction.

356
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:28,160
So let me look at
this v dot grad phi

357
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,180
that came into the
convection equation.

358
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:36,050
I'll divide and multiply by
the magnitude of the gradient,

359
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,160
and then I recognize this
as the normal vector.

360
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,250
I recognize that as n.

361
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:46,160
So this is v dot n, and I'm
going to give a name to v dot n

362
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,790
and call it F. That's the speed,
speed in the normal direction,

363
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,290
v dot n.

364
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,740
And then there's
this factor magnitude

365
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,590
of grad phi coming along.

366
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,510
OK, so that's the equation.

367
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,410
That's sort of the
famous level set equation

368
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,990
where, if F is a
constant, that's the case

369
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,510
we're speaking about
of a fire moving.

370
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,940
But if F depends on the --
F could be a function of --

371
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,270
if I put parentheses in there, F
could be a function of gradient

372
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,650
phi, a more
complicated function.

373
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,540
For example, I wrote down,
because I would otherwise

374
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:36,690
forget, this could be our --
this is a possible F of grad

375
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,680
phi.

376
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,730
Actually, it depends on
more than the magnitude

377
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:48,140
so I'd better -- yeah.

378
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,070
And certainly not a linear one
because of that denominator.

379
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:59,890
So a big set of examples in
this subject, not linear,

380
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,940
are curvature shapes.

381
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,950
Actually, the curvature
problem is quite interesting.

382
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,240
If the movement depends
on the curvature --

383
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:17,690
so suppose I start with an
elliptical-looking shape,

384
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,320
the curvature is
smaller here, right?

385
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,600
Oh, I'm sorry, smaller curvature
there, larger curvature there,

386
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,640
and if we choose
the right evolution,

387
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,200
often it will come -- maybe this
is a case where the movement is

388
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:46,770
inward because the curvature is
somehow the appropriate vectors

389
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,010
pointing in.

390
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,060
Here it would move in slowly
because the curvature is small.

391
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,710
Here it would move in faster
because the curvature is

392
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,280
larger.

393
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,270
The curvature is
tending to even out.

394
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:03,850
And, in fact, after a certain
-- as time goes on, any shape

395
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,960
approaches a circle, and the
circle shrinks and shrinks

396
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,390
and disappears.

397
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:15,000
So that this class of --
this sort of nonlinear group

398
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,560
of problems has a nice
geometric picture,

399
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,550
that whatever shape
you begin with,

400
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:25,150
you could even begin with
a really weird shape like

401
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,840
a barbell or something.

402
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,580
So this has zero curvature.

403
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,570
It wouldn't move at the start.

404
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:38,410
This would move in, so
after a little while

405
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:43,950
it would be like this, then
the corner would move in.

406
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,800
So it seems a little unlikely
it's true that after a while,

407
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,780
the shape would become
nearly circular,

408
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,020
get smaller and smaller,
and the shape would vanish.

409
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,580
Anyway, that a
curvature problem.

410
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:04,020
OK, so I guess following
the main theme of the course

411
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:10,370
would be write down a finite
difference method for the level

412
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,580
set equation.

413
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,220
That's the natural thing to do.

414
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,800
Write down a finite
difference method

415
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,440
for the level set equation.

416
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,940
Solve that numerically.

417
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,500
So that would be
on the web page.

418
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,280
The difference
equation is going to be

419
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,820
a sort of upwind
equation, but it's

420
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,740
a little messier
in two variables

421
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,820
to write out in detail here.

422
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,720
You'll see it there on the web.

423
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,650
OK, so you solve it,
and proceed in time,

424
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:50,420
and reinitialize when necessary
or when it seems advisable,

425
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,340
and you get a great
picture of this evolving,

426
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,010
moving interface.

427
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,880
So problems of that kind.

428
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,300
Or optimizing the interface.

429
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,070
There are other problems
where you might --

430
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,810
ones on the web where--
you might be, look,

431
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,380
the unknown might be a shape.

432
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,510
And you're looking
for the shape that

433
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:16,400
maybe makes an eigenvalue as
small as possible, subject

434
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,650
to some constraint.

435
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,460
So problems for shapes.

436
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,080
That's really the
type of problem

437
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,900
that level set methods
are created for.

438
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:35,790
OK, and these example show
the connection -- actually,

439
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:40,000
somehow the -- yeah, it's really
that if I tried to connect it

440
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,160
to conservation laws, to
the previous lectures,

441
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:58,880
this is our earlier guy,
would be -- in one variable,

442
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:06,250
let's say, this would correspond
to the derivative of maybe phi

443
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:12,550
or capital U. So the
conservation laws for little u

444
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:16,150
correspond to equations
like this for phi.

445
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:29,070
Well, or really, grad
phi in more dimensions.

446
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,040
OK, well, all right.

447
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,480
So what else remains to
say about this topic?

448
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,400
Really, I guess my main
point is to introduce you

449
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,540
to the idea of level sets
and level set method for when

450
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:54,390
problems of moving interfaces
and shape optimization come up.

451
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,620
I guess I also wanted
to say something

452
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,940
about this fast marching method.

453
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,710
OK, so what's that?

454
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:10,640
That's a case where there's
a very fast solution

455
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,250
to this problem.

456
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:19,030
And that case occurs when
the wave front is always

457
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:26,530
moving the same way, when
the F holds its sign.

458
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,170
So it would apply here.

459
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,650
So I could use the
fast marching method.

460
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:34,410
Rather than the
level set equation

461
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,370
and a finite difference
method for it,

462
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,210
I could use a fast marching
method for this problem

463
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:47,160
because I have no danger
of the shape turning,

464
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,950
changing direction,
coming back in on itself,

465
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,880
all the crazy things
that can happen,

466
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,710
the things that are
illustrated on the web.

467
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:02,900
OK, so the fast marching
method, well, maybe I --

468
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,010
so what's the problem
in that nice case?

469
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:15,350
I want to find -- I
could put on a mesh.

470
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:19,120
Yeah, let me take as a problem
the computation of the distance

471
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,720
function from this curve.

472
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,340
OK, so I could create a mesh.

473
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:34,090
So I'm going to take that
problem and turn it into a --

474
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:42,660
discretize it in a natural
way, and I'm searching

475
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,210
for the distance function.

476
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:51,010
So d of x and y is the distance
that I now want to compute.

477
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:55,790
It's the distance
from the curve C.

478
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,150
And let me make it a
signed distance function

479
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:03,320
so I'll make d negative in
here and positive outside

480
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,340
of the curve.

481
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:05,840
OK.

482
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,900
All right, so the
idea is we could --

483
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:25,112
this fits our level set picture,
but there's a direct way to do

484
00:34:25,112 --> 00:34:27,370
it.

485
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:31,210
And it's a nice -- it's
an algorithm that computer

486
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:35,080
scientists probably created
and appreciate, that --

487
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,680
we want to know the distance.

488
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,640
We want to compute d
at the mesh points.

489
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,690
Let me put another mesh point.

490
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:47,120
OK, so how do I --
so the question is,

491
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:53,240
how do I get from -- let me
put another y in there, too,

492
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,140
and that created
some more points.

493
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:02,830
So how to -- what
path -- you know,

494
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:07,990
how to get the distance from
the curve to each mesh point?

495
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,450
Well, here's the idea,
just in a nutshell.

496
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:18,000
You keep a list of
tentative distances

497
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,330
to all the mesh
points, and you look

498
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:27,280
for the one that's closest, like
it's probably maybe that guy.

499
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,660
So maybe that's right
on the curve, let's say.

500
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:37,880
So the idea is I can
-- that will be --

501
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,460
to get to this point, I'm
never going to take a path that

502
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,010
passes through the others.

503
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,630
To get here, I might
take a path that

504
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,990
goes through an earlier point.

505
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:54,740
But the nearest point,
the work is done.

506
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:00,990
So you successively sweep
through the mesh points,

507
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:05,970
pick the one whose current
distance, tentative distance,

508
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:09,150
is the smallest, and you
say that is the distance.

509
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,310
That's the right number.

510
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:15,350
Then now you know how far
it is to get to that point.

511
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:20,230
So now you could, if you had
to, update all the previous --

512
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,270
all the other distances by
knowing the correct one,

513
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:30,230
how distant it is, how
distant that point is.

514
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,270
OK, so then that one's settled.

515
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,510
Now you look at your
list, your updated list.

516
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:40,860
You pick the smallest one in
that, the closest one in that.

517
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,870
You found the best way
because things are never

518
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,630
going to reverse in
sign; you're never

519
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,420
going to travel
out and come back.

520
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,660
So the closest
one, you've got it.

521
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,140
So that might be
this or something,

522
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,640
and then we would update how
far it takes to get to those.

523
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,840
So that fast marching
method is a, you might say,

524
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:12,020
fairly natural idea of how
to compute distances when

525
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:20,560
everything is measured, when our
problem is -- has a fixed sign.

526
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,310
OK, so that's my short comment
on the fast marching method.

527
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:30,310
My longer comment is on the
level set method and level set

528
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,600
equation, where I
haven't written out

529
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,350
the finite difference
approximation that people

530
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:44,500
typically use, and
note on the web.

531
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,500
All right, so that's level
sets, which I probably

532
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,140
will not come back to.

533
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,720
It's kind of a one-shot lecture.

534
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,570
So let me take
the remaining time

535
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:05,190
to get feedback on the homework.

536
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,510
So were there four problems,
possible candidate problems,

537
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,280
for homework?

538
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,740
Let me put those down again.

539
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:15,570
I'm just going to ask first,
who did which problem.

540
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:19,640
So the first problem was
the conservation law -- no,

541
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,790
was the one-way-- OK, remind me.

542
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:27,560
I don't remember
the order I gave.

543
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,590
So was Number 4 the
conservation law?

544
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,610
The nonlinear one?

545
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

546
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,030
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

547
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,430
So the conservation law.

548
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:38,300
I'll just write down
u_t plus u*u_x equals 0.

549
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,540
Oh yeah, Number 1 was the basic
question of u_t equals c*u_x.

550
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:49,970
Yeah, that's right.

551
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:53,430
So that's a very important
and not too obvious

552
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,450
question, a good numerical
question, of what to do.

553
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,320
And Number 2 was the wave
equation; was that right?

554
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,042
AUDIENCE: Schrodinger's.

555
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:02,500
PROFESSOR:
Schrodinger's, Number 2.

556
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,110
Oh, boy.

557
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:03,880
OK.

558
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:10,000
So i*u_xx, which I haven't
discussed in class and I had --

559
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,630
the good question came up, how
do you deal with these complex

560
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,600
numbers because, of course,
it's going to get complex right

561
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,510
away.

562
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,700
Well, one way that
just occurs to me

563
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,320
is take the real
and imaginary parts

564
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,390
so that we get two equations,
two real equations.

565
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:30,344
PROFESSOR: OK, Number 3
was -- what did I have --

566
00:39:30,344 --> 00:39:31,510
AUDIENCE: The wave equation.

567
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,940
PROFESSOR: Was
the wave equation?

568
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,040
OK, second order?

569
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,200
AUDIENCE: First order.

570
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,940
PROFESSOR: Oh,
first-order wave equation?

571
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,200
Oh, OK.

572
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,380
So what was I -- OK, first-order
wave equation like so.

573
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:51,410
I'm sorry?

574
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

575
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,370
PROFESSOR: c*u_x, OK, yep.

576
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,430
All right, so was the question
there to go back to the--

577
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,680
AUDIENCE: Compare.

578
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,830
PROFESSOR: Compare, right.

579
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,710
Compare the methods we've
already established.

580
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:14,900
And then Number 4 was to tackle
some case of nonlinear equation

581
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,390
where shocks and
fans could appear.

582
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:23,690
OK, maybe I just get a
sense of who did what.

583
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,480
Number 1 how many?

584
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,220
Wow!

585
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,980
Number 1 was popular and
I think it's justified.

586
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,770
So this is certainly
the biggest choice.

587
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:41,780
So let me come back and get some
ideas of what you concluded.

588
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,780
Number 2, did anybody
tackle Schrodinger?

589
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,430
Yes.

590
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,857
A couple of complex guys.

591
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:47,190
Well, I know you asked about it.

592
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,660
Yep, OK, good.

593
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,760
Anybody go back to these?

594
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,700
For this?

595
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,290
You did?

596
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,850
OK, you may have done
a little bit of both.

597
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:01,790
And did anybody venture
to nonlinear world?

598
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:02,350
One.

599
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,610
Good, OK.

600
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,600
Nonlinear person.

601
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,920
I'm glad to know that, right.

602
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,900
So this is like -- this homework
you could think of us as like

603
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,710
prep for a possible project.

604
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:19,760
Your project could grow
out of this homework,

605
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,800
or it could grow from other
things that are coming.

606
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,760
OK.

607
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,310
All right, let's stick with this
one then since a lot of people

608
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:31,770
will have input on it.

609
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,900
Let me ask -- well, I'll
just ask naive questions

610
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,600
because you've actually
done the calculation.

611
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,230
Is there a method
you'd recommend?

612
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:48,350
If you had a problem like that
or, I mean, like for real,

613
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:54,340
and you had to invest
in a code and use it,

614
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,610
just give an opinion.

615
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,030
Or did you only try one method?

616
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,480
Tell me something,
positive or negative,

617
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,630
about your experience with this.

618
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,430
Yeah, thanks.

619
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

620
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,590
PROFESSOR: Maybe you
push -- in theory,

621
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,170
there's some mike you push and
this will be the first time

622
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,260
we've ever done it.

623
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,260
OK, terrific.

624
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,760
Go ahead.

625
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,922
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

626
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:26,130
PROFESSOR: Centered explicit.

627
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,720
Let me write that down.

628
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

629
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,570
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

630
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:43,900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

631
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,660
PROFESSOR: Yes.

632
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:51,500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

633
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
PROFESSOR: That's right.

634
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,520
So, OK, the centered
explicit one

635
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,440
is computing this
from three old values.

636
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,130
We certainly need
three because we've

637
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,500
got a second derivative there.

638
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,840
But then we have
a certain amount

639
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,750
of that second derivative and
a certain amount of this one,

640
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,350
and that can make one of those
three numbers go negative.

641
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:16,350
They always add the one because
the constant is certainly

642
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:18,460
a solution we want to keep.

643
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,540
OK, so when a coefficient
went negative,

644
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:27,580
that doesn't mean
instability; is that right?

645
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,524
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

646
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:30,190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

647
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,897
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

648
00:43:32,897 --> 00:43:33,480
PROFESSOR: OK.

649
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,924
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

650
00:43:35,924 --> 00:43:36,590
PROFESSOR: Fine.

651
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:39,527
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

652
00:43:39,527 --> 00:43:40,110
PROFESSOR: OK.

653
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

654
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,940
PROFESSOR: Implicit had
no trouble with that.

655
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,280
Yeah, OK.

656
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,040
Or it didn't matter what the
Peclet number, or the cell

657
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,295
Peclet number was, or
whatever we called it.

658
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:51,170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

659
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,340
PROFESSOR: Uh-huh.

660
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,932
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

661
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:03,640
PROFESSOR: I see.

662
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

663
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,210
PROFESSOR: OK, if you went
-- when you say implicit,

664
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:12,480
it's just the diffusion
term that's going implicit?

665
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,360
OK, OK.

666
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,590
So that should be a
very stable process,

667
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:23,640
but, of course, now we've
got this term affecting it.

668
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,230
So you actually found out
that even the implicit one

669
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,230
could break?

670
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:31,344
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

671
00:44:31,344 --> 00:44:32,010
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

672
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,546
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

673
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:35,170
PROFESSOR: Yes.

674
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

675
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,220
PROFESSOR: Really?

676
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

677
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,350
PROFESSOR: Huh!

678
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:38,980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

679
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,440
PROFESSOR: Even
the implicit one?

680
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,284
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

681
00:44:44,284 --> 00:44:45,200
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

682
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,910
So on the implicit part -- so
this was method one and this

683
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,550
was method two, implicit
for the diffusion,

684
00:44:53,550 --> 00:45:00,200
but you found that that
could still be unstable.

685
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,830
OK, yeah.

686
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:05,870
Anybody else do this comparison?

687
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:10,600
Can you push your
mike button just to --

688
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,280
this is a hotshot room that
we haven't taken advantage

689
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,409
of, but it's our chance.

690
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:16,950
AUDIENCE: I actually looked at
the -- when I first did the --

691
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:21,000
looking at just the
growth factors of explicit

692
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,780
and implicit --

693
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,900
PROFESSOR: OK,
looking at that G --

694
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,034
AUDIENCE: --on the
convection term as well?

695
00:45:26,034 --> 00:45:26,700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

696
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,060
AUDIENCE: And I used implicit
for all the diffusion.

697
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,640
And I found the most
stable using upwind,

698
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,290
when both were implicit,
the growth factor

699
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,560
was actually able
to stay below 1.

700
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,420
PROFESSOR: So you moved
the first derivative also

701
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,830
up to the new time?

702
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,961
OK, and that was -- then
you don't have a problem.

703
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:48,960
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

704
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,870
So stable for pretty
much all big R, little r.

705
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,970
But the explicit upwind
for the convection term

706
00:45:55,970 --> 00:46:00,792
was stable for most, as long
as the little r was below 0.5.

707
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:01,500
PROFESSOR: I see.

708
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,496
So the numbers
could tell you the--

709
00:46:03,496 --> 00:46:04,120
AUDIENCE: Sure.

710
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,490
PROFESSOR: --limits
on little r and big R?

711
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:07,170
AUDIENCE: Yep.

712
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:11,180
And then I did the
explicit convection

713
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,500
upwind with the implicit
centered diffusion,

714
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,980
and that seemed to be pretty
stable unless I really started

715
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,132
cranking the numbers out.

716
00:46:17,132 --> 00:46:17,840
PROFESSOR: I see.

717
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,270
Oh, that's the one
that he had also done?

718
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,260
AUDIENCE: Yep.

719
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,380
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

720
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:31,610
And now, so I guess I remember,
in the figure that isn't yet

721
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,620
drawn that might emerge
from your calculations,

722
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:39,990
a possibility where --
depending on the Peclet number,

723
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,750
where it was stable.

724
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:44,950
It didn't blow up, but
oscillations appeared

725
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:49,580
and the calculations -- you
wouldn't do it even so --

726
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,795
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

727
00:46:50,795 --> 00:46:52,420
PROFESSOR: That's
what you meant, yeah.

728
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:58,070
OK, so there are cases
where the method isn't good

729
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:04,030
even though it's stable, which
is like important to realize

730
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,280
that that can happen.

731
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,900
Because up to now, stability has
been, you know, the holy grail.

732
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,210
But it's really a good
solution that's the holy grail.

733
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,090
Yes?

734
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:17,600
Go ahead.

735
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,770
AUDIENCE: I did kind of a
bigger picture where I basically

736
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:25,670
tried to build
the pieces so just

737
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:28,520
to isolate the advection
term and the diffusion term

738
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,905
and then build their matrices.

739
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:30,530
PROFESSOR: Yes.

740
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:32,530
AUDIENCE: And then look
at the combination rule.

741
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,902
So when you went to where
you had both terms present--

742
00:47:34,902 --> 00:47:35,610
PROFESSOR: Right.

743
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:38,650
AUDIENCE: --how the
matrices were actually --

744
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,650
came together to form the--

745
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:45,640
PROFESSOR: So you took a
matrix picture of the --

746
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,930
with all the mesh points, mesh
values, at once rather than--

747
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,800
AUDIENCE: And then I simulated
with them just convection,

748
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,840
just diffusion and then the
coupled problem of both of them

749
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,430
to see how that -- just
one method may be unstable

750
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:01,562
for a given formulation--

751
00:48:01,562 --> 00:48:02,270
PROFESSOR: Right.

752
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,436
AUDIENCE: --but yet when
you saw the coupled problem

753
00:48:04,436 --> 00:48:06,540
with those two pieces,
it actually is stable.

754
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,280
So you could look at like the
-- when you build the matrices,

755
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,111
you can look at the eigenvalues
and you can make sure that

756
00:48:12,111 --> 00:48:12,610
they're--

757
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:15,570
PROFESSOR: Let me
comment a little on that.

758
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:19,340
I'll do that, but I don't want
to cut off anybody who has

759
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:23,530
another comment to throw in here
before I say something about --

760
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:25,920
follow up on matrices.

761
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,190
Anybody got some urgent thing?

762
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:31,130
Let me just, in the
remaining minute,

763
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:34,180
just say a word
because, of course,

764
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,070
you'll know that I think
of the matrix description

765
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:41,180
quickly and fondly.

766
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:46,800
So just to write down the sort
of matrices that are in here,

767
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,410
from the second difference,
the second difference matrix is

768
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:56,120
going to be -- it's going
to have our -- well,

769
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:01,490
I guess it'll be 1, minus
2, and 1 in a typical row.

770
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:04,040
We haven't written
any matrices down.

771
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:11,400
It's amazing that -- we'd be
at about the, I don't know,

772
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,460
eighth or ninth lecture now,
and not have seen this matrix,

773
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,810
but here it is.

774
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:21,820
OK, so that's the matrix where
I'm at a fixed time level.

775
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:26,110
I'm taking the second
differences of all the points

776
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:27,570
along that level.

777
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:31,150
And now, the main
point for the moment

778
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:35,850
is to contrast that with
a first difference matrix

779
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:40,040
which, well, that depends
whether I take it centered.

780
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,710
Maybe if it's a
centered difference,

781
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:45,260
it would be a 1, 0, minus 1.

782
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:50,420
And, of course, there's a 2
delta x in the denominator.

783
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,880
so a minus 1, 0, 1.

784
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:59,370
So that would be a
centered difference that

785
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:02,900
doesn't do anything, doesn't
use the middle value,

786
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,360
but takes the difference
between the value at the right

787
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,570
and the value at the left.

788
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,860
Or, an upwind.

789
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:18,830
So delta_upwind would be more
of a 1's forward of the point

790
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:26,570
and minus 1's at
u_(j, n) and 0's here.

791
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,890
OK.

792
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:31,420
So what you're
saying, am I right

793
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:36,000
in thinking you took
some combination of the--

794
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:43,290
AUDIENCE: An implicit method for
one and explicit for the other,

795
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:47,300
you can do them
independently by --

796
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,042
you can invert the
implicit matrix--

797
00:50:50,042 --> 00:50:50,750
PROFESSOR: Right.

798
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,510
AUDIENCE: --and pre-multiply
the other side and build--

799
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,150
PROFESSOR: So this
is a way to see,

800
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:58,510
and actually the next
months of our course

801
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:01,990
are going to be
about, how do you

802
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:04,920
deal with these large
difference matrices.

803
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,060
These are in one dimension
so they're tridiagonal,

804
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,090
and they're, of course,
easy to deal with it.

805
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,030
But problems, serious problems,
come up in more dimension.

806
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:20,590
But here, can I just
express one thought here?

807
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:24,340
The eigenvalues
of these matrices

808
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,510
and their combinations,
as you say,

809
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:30,310
are what's going to control,
as eigenvalues always do,

810
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:32,540
growth of solution.

811
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:37,970
Now we already had
numbers G, growth factors,

812
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:43,750
that we computed by the von
Neumann idea of following

813
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,100
exponentials, e to the i*k*x.

814
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:51,270
So these numbers too were --
their purpose was to track

815
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,360
the growth of solution.

816
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,730
And what I want to say is
that very often, I mean,

817
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:03,460
that these numbers and the
eigenvalues of the matrices,

818
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:07,760
they're very closely
related ideas.

819
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,960
In fact, they'll
be the same idea

820
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,050
if the eigenvector is
a pure exponential.

821
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:17,950
So that's really the
link between eigenvalues

822
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:25,500
of matrices and growth factors
G that depended on frequency k.

823
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:32,890
If the eigenvector was a pure
e to the i*k*x on the mesh,

824
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:39,140
then that growth factor is
identical to the eigenvalue

825
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:43,290
that we get in one step of
the difference equation.

826
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:49,280
So the idea was that the
eigenvectors, the details

827
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,340
of the eigenvectors,
will be affected

828
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,070
by boundary conditions.

829
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,870
So von Neumann
thought, all right,

830
00:52:54,870 --> 00:53:00,590
I'll cut through that Gordian
knot and just pretend I have

831
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:02,790
a pure e to the i*k*x.

832
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:06,440
I look inside the region,
not at the boundary where

833
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,930
we may be doing
something different,

834
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:12,440
and we get a G, a
growth factor G.

835
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,980
And again, if the eigenfunction
was really an eigenvector, then

836
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,540
that G would be
the same as lambda.

837
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,220
OK, we're past time.

838
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,760
I always appreciate that
you are patient about that.

839
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,640
So I'll collect those
that are complete.

840
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,940
And if you wanted
to speak to Mr. Cho

841
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:37,870
or have a little more time to
do more, Monday is good, too.

842
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,460
OK, thanks.
