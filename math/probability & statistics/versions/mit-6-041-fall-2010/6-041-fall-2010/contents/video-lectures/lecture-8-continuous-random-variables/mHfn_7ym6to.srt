JOHN TSITSIKLIS: OK.

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,020
We can start.

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,540
Good morning.

11
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,600
So we're going to start
now a new unit.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,200
For the next couple of lectures,
we will be talking

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,560
about continuous random
variables.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,520
So this is new material
which is not going

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,400
to be in the quiz.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,170
You are going to have a long
break next week without any

17
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,230
lecture, just a quiz and
recitation and tutorial.

18
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,500
So what's going to happen
in this new unit?

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,760
Basically, we want to do
everything that we did for

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,610
discrete random variables,
reintroduce the same sort of

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,510
concepts but see how they apply
and how they need to be

22
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,840
modified in order to talk about
random variables that

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,700
take continuous values.

24
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,610
At some level, it's
all the same.

25
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,340
At some level, it's quite a bit
harder because when things

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,490
are continuous, calculus
comes in.

27
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,770
So the calculations that you
have to do on the side

28
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,760
sometimes need a little
bit more thinking.

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,300
In terms of new concepts,
there's not going to be a

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,200
whole lot today, some analogs
of things we have done.

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,110
We're going to introduce the
concept of cumulative

32
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,950
distribution functions, which
allows us to deal with

33
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,750
discrete and continuous
random variables, all

34
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,560
of them in one shot.

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,890
And finally, introduce a famous
kind of continuous

36
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,900
random variable, the normal
random variable.

37
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,970
OK, so what's the story?

38
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,970
Continuous random variables are
random variables that take

39
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,350
values over the continuum.

40
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,470
So the numerical value of the
random variable can be any

41
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,240
real number.

42
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,600
They don't take values just
in a discrete set.

43
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,660
So we have our sample space.

44
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,020
The experiment happens.

45
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,730
We get some omega, a sample
point in the sample space.

46
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,070
And once that point is
determined, it determines the

47
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,500
numerical value of the
random variable.

48
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,370
Remember, random variables are
functions on the sample space.

49
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,020
You pick a sample point.

50
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,690
This determines the numerical
value of the random variable.

51
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,500
So that numerical value is going
to be some real number

52
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,010
on that line.

53
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,550
Now we want to say something
about the distribution of the

54
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,290
random variable.

55
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,970
We want to say which values are
more likely than others to

56
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,060
occur in a certain sense.

57
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,910
For example, you may be
interested in a particular

58
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,090
event, the event that the random
variable takes values

59
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,360
in the interval from a to b.

60
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,950
And we want to say something
about the

61
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,820
probability of that event.

62
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,510
In principle, how
is this done?

63
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,010
You go back to the sample space,
and you find all those

64
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,790
outcomes for which the value of
the random variable happens

65
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,500
to be in that interval.

66
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,870
The probability that the random
variable falls here is

67
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,070
the same as the probability of
all outcomes that make the

68
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,290
random variable to
fall in there.

69
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,190
So in principle, you can work on
the original sample space,

70
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,750
find the probability of this
event, and you would be done.

71
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,810
But similar to what happened in
chapter 2, we want to kind

72
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,910
of push the sample space in the
background and just work

73
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,890
directly on the real
axis and talk about

74
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,640
probabilities up here.

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,430
So we want now a way to specify
probabilities, how

76
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,340
they are bunched together, or
arranged, along the real line.

77
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,980
So what did we do for discrete
random variables?

78
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,100
We introduced PMFs, probability
mass functions.

79
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,100
And the way that we described
the random variable was by

80
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,300
saying this point has so much
mass on top of it, that point

81
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,790
has so much mass on top
of it, and so on.

82
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,610
And so we assigned a total
amount of 1 unit of

83
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,670
probability.

84
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,810
We assigned it to different
masses, which we put at

85
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,870
different points on
the real axis.

86
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,070
So that's what you do if
somebody gives you a pound of

87
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,910
discrete stuff, a pound of
mass in little chunks.

88
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,300
And you place those chunks
at a few points.

89
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,890
Now, in the continuous case,
this total unit of probability

90
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,440
mass does not sit just on
discrete points but is spread

91
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,140
all over the real axis.

92
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,280
So now we're going to have a
unit of mass that spreads on

93
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,510
top of the real axis.

94
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,020
How do we describe masses that
are continuously spread?

95
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,680
The way we describe them is
by specifying densities.

96
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,800
That is, how thick is the mass
that's sitting here?

97
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,210
How dense is the mass that's
sitting there?

98
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,260
So that's exactly what
we're going to do.

99
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,930
We're going to introduce the
concept of a probability

100
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,340
density function that tells us
how probabilities accumulate

101
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,270
at different parts
of the real axis.

102
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,870
So here's an example or a
picture of a possible

103
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,210
probability density function.

104
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,210
What does that density function
kind of convey

105
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,290
intuitively?

106
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,510
Well, that these x's
are relatively

107
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,160
less likely to occur.

108
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,120
Those x's are somewhat more
likely to occur because the

109
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,930
density is higher.

110
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,950
Now, for a more formal
definition, we're going to say

111
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:35,620
that a random variable X is said
to be continuous if it

112
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,560
can be described by a
density function in

113
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,780
the following sense.

114
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,910
We have a density function.

115
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,830
And we calculate probabilities
of falling inside an interval

116
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,580
by finding the area under
the curve that sits

117
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,940
on top of that interval.

118
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,800
So that's sort of the defining
relation for

119
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,190
continuous random variables.

120
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,860
It's an implicit definition.

121
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,870
And it tells us a random
variable is continuous if we

122
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,560
can calculate probabilities
this way.

123
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,520
So the probability of falling
in this interval is the area

124
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,500
under this curve.

125
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,950
Mathematically, it's the
integral of the density over

126
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,020
this particular interval.

127
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,410
If the density happens to be
constant over that interval,

128
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,610
the area under the curve would
be the length of the interval

129
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,440
times the height of
the density, which

130
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,170
sort of makes sense.

131
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,020
Now, because the density is not
constant but it kind of

132
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,720
moves around, what you need is
to write down an integral.

133
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,100
Now, this formula is very much
analogous to what you would do

134
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,030
for discrete random variables.

135
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,140
For a discrete random variable,
how do you calculate

136
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,610
this probability?

137
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,800
You look at all x's
in this interval.

138
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,060
And you add the probability mass
function over that range.

139
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,660
So just for comparison, this
would be the formula for the

140
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,590
discrete case--

141
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,620
the sum over all x's in the
interval from a to b over the

142
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,420
probability mass function.

143
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,650
And there is a syntactic analogy
that's happening here

144
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,160
and which will be a persistent
theme when we deal with

145
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,920
continuous random variables.

146
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,620
Sums get replaced
by integrals.

147
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,110
In the discrete case, you add.

148
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,920
In the continuous case,
you integrate.

149
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,600
Mass functions get replaced
by density functions.

150
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,500
So you can take pretty much any
formula from the discrete

151
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,020
case and translate it to a
continuous analog of that

152
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,480
formula, as we're
going to see.

153
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,240
OK.

154
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,040
So let's take this
now as our model.

155
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,220
What is the probability that
the random variable takes a

156
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,440
specific value if we have a
continuous random variable?

157
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,200
Well, this would be the case.

158
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,880
It's a case of a trivial
interval, where the two end

159
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,660
points coincide.

160
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,670
So it would be the integral
from a to itself.

161
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,520
So you're integrating just
over a single point.

162
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,790
Now, when you integrate over
a single point, the

163
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,600
integral is just 0.

164
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,980
The area under the curve, if
you're only looking at a

165
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,560
single point, it's 0.

166
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,670
So big property of continuous
random variables is that any

167
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,940
individual point has
0 probability.

168
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,740
In particular, when you look at
the value of the density,

169
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,299
the density does not tell you
the probability of that point.

170
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,860
The point itself has
0 probability.

171
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,409
So the density tells you
something a little different.

172
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,645
We are going to see shortly
what that is.

173
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,070
Before we get there,
can the density be

174
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,410
an arbitrary function?

175
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,160
Almost, but not quite.

176
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,650
There are two things
that we want.

177
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,310
First, since densities
are used to calculate

178
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,690
probabilities, and since
probabilities must be

179
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,840
non-negative, the density should
also be non-negative.

180
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,960
Otherwise you would be getting
negative probabilities, which

181
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,360
is not a good thing.

182
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,930
So that's a basic property
that any density function

183
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,640
should obey.

184
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,970
The second property that we
need is that the overall

185
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,210
probability of the entire real
line should be equal to 1.

186
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,980
So if you ask me, what is the
probability that x falls

187
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,760
between minus infinity and plus
infinity, well, we are

188
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,590
sure that x is going to
fall in that range.

189
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:37,400
So the probability of that
event should be 1.

190
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,480
So the probability of being
between minus infinity and

191
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,600
plus infinity should be 1, which
means that the integral

192
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,410
from minus infinity to plus
infinity should be 1.

193
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,460
So that just tells us that
there's 1 unit of total

194
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,690
probability that's being
spread over our space.

195
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,000
Now, what's the best way to
think intuitively about what

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,480
the density function does?

197
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,470
The interpretation that I find
most natural and easy to

198
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,300
convey the meaning of a
density is to look at

199
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,220
probabilities of small
intervals.

200
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,850
So let us take an x somewhere
here and then x plus delta

201
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,230
just next to it.

202
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,050
So delta is a small number.

203
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,460
And let's look at the
probability of the event that

204
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,750
we get a value in that range.

205
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,220
For continuous random variables,
the way we find the

206
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,270
probability of falling in that
range is by integrating the

207
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,550
density over that range.

208
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,610
So we're drawing this picture.

209
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,060
And we want to take the
area under this curve.

210
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,760
Now, what happens if delta
is a fairly small number?

211
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,030
If delta is pretty small, our
density is not going to change

212
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,040
much over that range.

213
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,330
So you can pretend that
the density is

214
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,230
approximately constant.

215
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,550
And so to find the area under
the curve, you just take the

216
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,760
base times the height.

217
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,630
And it doesn't matter where
exactly you take the height in

218
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,140
that interval, because the
density doesn't change very

219
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,370
much over that interval.

220
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,760
And so the integral becomes just
base times the height.

221
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,020
So for small intervals, the
probability of a small

222
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:30,170
interval is approximately
the density times delta.

223
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,340
So densities essentially
give us

224
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,670
probabilities of small intervals.

225
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,100
And if you want to think about
it a little differently, you

226
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,020
can take that delta from
here and send it to

227
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,960
the denominator there.

228
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,880
And what this tells you
is that the density is

229
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,270
probability per unit length for
intervals of small length.

230
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:59,860
So the units of density are
probability per unit length.

231
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,420
Densities are not
probabilities.

232
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,430
They are rates at which
probabilities accumulate,

233
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,780
probabilities per unit length.

234
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,780
And since densities are not
probabilities, they don't have

235
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,960
to be less than 1.

236
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,730
Ordinary probabilities always
must be less than 1.

237
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,000
But density is a different
kind of thing.

238
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,530
It can get pretty big
in some places.

239
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,680
It can even sort of blow
up in some places.

240
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,620
As long as the total area under
the curve is 1, other

241
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,830
than that, the curve can do
anything that it wants.

242
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,930
Now, the density prescribes
for us the

243
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:41,620
probability of intervals.

244
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,710
Sometimes we may want to find
the probability of more

245
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,540
general sets.

246
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,780
How would we do that?

247
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,580
Well, for nice sets, you will
just integrate the density

248
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,260
over that nice set.

249
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,640
I'm not quite defining
what "nice" means.

250
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,140
That's a pretty technical
topic in the theory of

251
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,160
probability.

252
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,530
But for our purposes, usually we
will take b to be something

253
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,500
like a union of intervals.

254
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,200
So how do you find the
probability of falling in the

255
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,690
union of two intervals?

256
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,180
Well, you find the probability
of falling in that interval

257
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,240
plus the probability of falling
in that interval.

258
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,150
So it's the integral over this
interval plus the integral

259
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,500
over that interval.

260
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,370
And you think of this as just
integrating over the union of

261
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,730
the two intervals.

262
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,580
So once you can calculate
probabilities of intervals,

263
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,590
then usually you are in
business, and you can

264
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,000
calculate anything else
you might want.

265
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,330
So the probability density
function is a complete

266
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,530
description of any statistical
information we might be

267
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:44,425
interested in for a continuous
random variable.

268
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:44,880
OK.

269
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,330
So now we can start walking
through the concepts and the

270
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,730
definitions that we have for
discrete random variables and

271
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,230
translate them to the
continuous case.

272
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,960
The first big concept is the
concept of the expectation.

273
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,680
One can start with a
mathematical definition.

274
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,810
And here we put down
a definition by

275
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,730
just translating notation.

276
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,160
Wherever we have a sum in
the discrete case, we

277
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,060
now write an integral.

278
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,310
And wherever we had the
probability mass function, we

279
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,570
now throw in the probability
density function.

280
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,010
This formula--

281
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,200
you may have seen it in
freshman physics--

282
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,190
basically, it again gives you
the center of gravity of the

283
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,150
picture that you have when
you have the density.

284
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:36,460
It's the center of gravity of
the object sitting underneath

285
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,220
the probability density
function.

286
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,900
So that the interpretation
still applies.

287
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,120
It's also true that our
conceptual interpretation of

288
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,820
what an expectation means is
also valid in this case.

289
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,770
That is, if you repeat an
experiment a zillion times,

290
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,100
each time drawing an independent
sample of your

291
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,500
random variable x, in the long
run, the average that you are

292
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,860
going to get should be
the expectation.

293
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,740
One can reason in a hand-waving
way, sort of

294
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,440
intuitively, the way we did it
for the case of discrete

295
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,770
random variables.

296
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,940
But this is also a theorem
of some sort.

297
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,300
It's a limit theorem that we're
going to visit later on

298
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,530
in this class.

299
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,700
Having defined the expectation
and having claimed that the

300
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,100
interpretation of the
expectation is that same as

301
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,810
before, then we can start taking
just any formula you've

302
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,580
seen before and just
translate it.

303
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,200
So for example, to find the
expected value of a function

304
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,430
of a continuous random variable,
you do not have to

305
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,130
find the PDF or PMF of g(X).

306
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,040
You can just work directly with
the original distribution

307
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,990
of the random variable
capital X.

308
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,570
And this formula is the same
as for the discrete case.

309
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,880
Sums get replaced
by integrals.

310
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,340
And PMFs get replaced by PDFs.

311
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,050
And in particular, the variance
of a random variable

312
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,080
is defined again the same way.

313
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,390
The variance is the expected
value, the average of the

314
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,920
distance of X from the mean
and then squared.

315
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,690
So it's the expected value for
a random variable that takes

316
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,500
these numerical values.

317
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,250
And same formula as before,
integral and F instead of

318
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,420
summation, and the P.

319
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,090
And the formulas that we have
derived or formulas that you

320
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,260
have seen for the discrete case,
they all go through the

321
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,090
continuous case.

322
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,990
So for example, the useful
relation for variances, which

323
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:37,410
is this one, remains true.

324
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:37,850
All right.

325
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,790
So time for an example.

326
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,500
The most simple example of a
continuous random variable

327
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,170
that there is, is the so-called

328
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,670
uniform random variable.

329
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,940
So the uniform random variable
is described by a density

330
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,540
which is 0 except over
an interval.

331
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,360
And over that interval,
it is constant.

332
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,190
What is it meant to convey?

333
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,829
It's trying to convey the idea
that all x's in this range are

334
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,540
equally likely.

335
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,390
Well, that doesn't
say very much.

336
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,170
Any individual x has
0 probability.

337
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,460
So it's conveying a little
more than that.

338
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:18,000
What it is saying is that if I
take an interval of a given

339
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,089
length delta, and I take another
interval of the same

340
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:26,290
length, delta, under the uniform
distribution, these

341
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,290
two intervals are going to have
the same probability.

342
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:34,670
So being uniform means that
intervals of same length have

343
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,720
the same probability.

344
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,390
So no interval is more likely
than any other to occur.

345
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,200
And in that sense, it conveys
the idea of sort of complete

346
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,100
randomness.

347
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,430
Any little interval in our range
is equally likely as any

348
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,830
other little interval.

349
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,260
All right.

350
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,870
So what's the formula
for this density?

351
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,280
I only told you the range.

352
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,490
What's the height?

353
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,340
Well, the area under the density
must be equal to 1.

354
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,700
Total probability
is equal to 1.

355
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,100
And so the height, inescapably,
is going to be 1

356
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,480
over (b minus a).

357
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,880
That's the height that makes
the density integrate to 1.

358
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,610
So that's the formula.

359
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,240
And if you don't want to lose
one point in your exam, you

360
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,946
have to say that it's
also 0, otherwise.

361
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:27,794
OK.

362
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:28,260
All right?

363
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,760
That's sort of the
complete answer.

364
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,590
How about the expected value
of this random variable?

365
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,060
OK.

366
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,730
You can find the expected value
in two different ways.

367
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,400
One is to start with
the definition.

368
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,220
And so you integrate
over the range of

369
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,185
interest times the density.

370
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:55,460
And you figure out what that
integral is going to be.

371
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,800
Or you can be a little
more clever.

372
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,290
Since the center-of-gravity
interpretation is still true,

373
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,890
it must be the center of gravity
of this picture.

374
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,680
And the center of gravity is,
of course, the midpoint.

375
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,740
Whenever you have symmetry,
the mean is always the

376
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:20,630
midpoint of the diagram that
gives you the PDF.

377
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,180
OK.

378
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,870
So that's the expected
value of X.

379
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,990
Finally, regarding the variance,
well, there you will

380
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,240
have to do a little
bit of calculus.

381
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,460
We can write down
the definition.

382
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,930
So it's an integral
instead of a sum.

383
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:40,590
A typical value of the random
variable minus the expected

384
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,280
value, squared, times
the density.

385
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,650
And we integrate.

386
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,820
You do this integral, and you
find it's (b minus a) squared

387
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,660
over that number, which
happens to be 12.

388
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,140
Maybe more interesting is the
standard deviation itself.

389
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,760
And you see that the standard
deviation is proportional to

390
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,280
the width of that interval.

391
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,850
This agrees with our intuition,
that the standard

392
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:12,730
deviation is meant to capture a
sense of how spread out our

393
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,000
distribution is.

394
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,370
And the standard deviation has
the same units as the random

395
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,040
variable itself.

396
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,860
So it's sort of good to-- you
can interpret it in a

397
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,180
reasonable way based
on that picture.

398
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,890
OK, yes.

399
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:38,280
Now, let's go up one level and
think about the following.

400
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,740
So we have formulas for the
discrete case, formulas for

401
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,690
the continuous case.

402
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,420
So you can write them
side by side.

403
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,100
One has sums, the other
has integrals.

404
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,450
Suppose you want to make an
argument and say that

405
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,160
something is true for every
random variable.

406
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,770
You would essentially need to
do two separate proofs, for

407
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,510
discrete and for continuous.

408
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,400
Is there some way of dealing
with random variables just one

409
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,130
at a time, in one shot, using
a sort of uniform notation?

410
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,990
Is there a unifying concept?

411
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,170
Luckily, there is one.

412
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,400
It's the notion of the
cumulative distribution

413
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,850
function of a random variable.

414
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,730
And it's a concept that applies
equally well to

415
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,890
discrete and continuous
random variables.

416
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,210
So it's an object that we can
use to describe distributions

417
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,340
in both cases, using just
one piece of notation.

418
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,600
So what's the definition?

419
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,290
It's the probability that the
random variable takes values

420
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,030
less than a certain
number little x.

421
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,440
So you go to the diagram, and
you see what's the probability

422
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,060
that I'm falling to
the left of this.

423
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,680
And you specify those
probabilities for all x's.

424
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,400
In the continuous case, you
calculate those probabilities

425
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,090
using the integral formula.

426
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,730
So you integrate from
here up to x.

427
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,850
In the discrete case, to find
the probability to the left of

428
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,790
some point, you go here, and
you add probabilities again

429
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,980
from the left.

430
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,770
So the way that the cumulative
distribution function is

431
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,010
calculated is a little different
in the continuous

432
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,850
and discrete case.

433
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,990
In one case you integrate.

434
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,440
In the other, you sum.

435
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,340
But leaving aside how it's being
calculated, what the

436
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,530
concept is, it's the same
concept in both cases.

437
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,810
So let's see what the shape of
the cumulative distribution

438
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,360
function would be in
the two cases.

439
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:34,100
So here what we want is to
record for every little x the

440
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,760
probability of falling
to the left of x.

441
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,240
So let's start here.

442
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,580
Probability of falling to
the left of here is 0--

443
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,550
0, 0, 0.

444
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,280
Once we get here and we start
moving to the right, the

445
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,750
probability of falling to the
left of here is the area of

446
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,610
this little rectangle.

447
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,590
And the area of that little
rectangle increases linearly

448
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,290
as I keep moving.

449
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,780
So accordingly, the CDF
increases linearly until I get

450
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,870
to that point.

451
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,670
At that point, what's
the value of my CDF?

452
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,020
1.

453
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,400
I have accumulated all the
probability there is.

454
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,180
I have integrated it.

455
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,890
This total area has
to be equal to 1.

456
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,780
So it reaches 1, and then
there's no more probability to

457
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,040
be accumulated.

458
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,170
It just stays at 1.

459
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:28,050
So the value here
is equal to 1.

460
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,270
OK.

461
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:36,716
How would you find the density
if somebody gave you the CDF?

462
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:39,570
The CDF is the integral
of the density.

463
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,820
Therefore, the density is the
derivative of the CDF.

464
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,190
So you look at this picture
and take the derivative.

465
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,580
Derivative is 0 here, 0 here.

466
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,330
And it's a constant
up there, which

467
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,120
corresponds to that constant.

468
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,900
So more generally, and an
important thing to know, is

469
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:04,250
that the derivative of the CDF
is equal to the density--

470
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,170
almost, with a little
bit of an exception.

471
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,800
What's the exception?

472
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,200
At those places where the CDF
does not have a derivative--

473
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,520
here where it has a corner--

474
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,720
the derivative is undefined.

475
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,030
And in some sense, the
density is also

476
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,460
ambiguous at that point.

477
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,860
Is my density at the endpoint,
is it 0 or is it 1?

478
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,330
It doesn't really matter.

479
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,670
If you change the density at
just a single point, it's not

480
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,000
going to affect the
value of any

481
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,530
integral you ever calculate.

482
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,900
So the value of the density at
the endpoint, you can leave it

483
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,390
as being ambiguous, or
you can specify it.

484
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,130
It doesn't matter.

485
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:53,590
So at all places where the
CDF has a derivative,

486
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,970
this will be true.

487
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,470
At those places where you have
corners, which do show up

488
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,740
sometimes, well, you
don't really care.

489
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,640
How about the discrete case?

490
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,450
In the discrete case, the CDF
has a more peculiar shape.

491
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,870
So let's do the calculation.

492
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,440
We want to find the
probability of b

493
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,920
to the left of here.

494
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,970
That probability is 0, 0, 0.

495
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,170
Once we cross that point, the
probability of being to the

496
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,140
left of here is 1/6.

497
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,030
So as soon as we cross the
point 1, we get the

498
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,740
probability of 1/6, which means
that the size of the

499
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,230
jump that we have here is 1/6.

500
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,020
Now, question.

501
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,175
At this point 1, which is the
correct value of the CDF?

502
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:39,090
Is it 0, or is it 1/6?

503
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,560
It's 1/6 because--

504
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,540
you need to look carefully
at the definitions, the

505
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,180
probability of x being less
than or equal to little x.

506
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,230
If I take little x to be 1,
it's the probability that

507
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,900
capital X is less than
or equal to 1.

508
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,730
So it includes the event
that x is equal to 1.

509
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,130
So it includes this
probability here.

510
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,710
So at jump points, the correct
value of the CDF is going to

511
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,650
be this one.

512
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,130
And now as I trace, x is
going to the right.

513
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,750
As soon as I cross this point,
I have added another 3/6

514
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,180
probability.

515
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:20,350
So that 3/6 causes a
jump to the CDF.

516
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,280
And that determines
the new value.

517
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,860
And finally, once I cross
the last point, I get

518
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,631
another jump of 2/6.

519
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:35,900
A general moral from these two
examples and these pictures.

520
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,270
CDFs are well defined
in both cases.

521
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:42,490
For the case of continuous
random variables, the CDF will

522
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,000
be a continuous function.

523
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,330
It starts from 0.

524
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,760
It eventually goes to 1
and goes smoothly--

525
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,100
well, continuously from smaller
to higher values.

526
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,200
It can only go up.

527
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,300
It cannot go down since we're
accumulating more and more

528
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,230
probability as we are
going to the right.

529
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,160
In the discrete case, again
it starts from 0,

530
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,610
and it goes to 1.

531
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,740
But it does it in a
staircase manner.

532
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:13,050
And you get a jump at each place
where the PMF assigns a

533
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,660
positive mass.

534
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,560
So jumps in the CDF are
associated with point masses

535
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,330
in our distribution.

536
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,570
In the continuous case, we don't
have any point masses,

537
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,470
so we do not have any
jumps either.

538
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,300
Now, besides saving
us notation--

539
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,020
we don't have to deal
with discrete

540
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,000
and continuous twice--

541
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,240
CDFs give us actually a little
more flexibility.

542
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,840
Not all random variables are
continuous or discrete.

543
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,790
You can cook up random variables
that are kind of

544
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:53,410
neither or a mixture
of the two.

545
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:59,540
An example would be, let's
say you play a game.

546
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,620
And with a certain probability,
you get a certain

547
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,690
number of dollars
in your hands.

548
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,000
So you flip a coin.

549
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,120
And with probability 1/2, you
get a reward of 1/2 dollars.

550
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,430
And with probability 1/2, you
are led to a dark room where

551
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,580
you spin a wheel of fortune.

552
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,410
And that wheel of fortune gives
you a random reward

553
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,610
between 0 and 1.

554
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,600
So any of these outcomes
is possible.

555
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,100
And the amount that you're
going to get,

556
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,930
let's say, is uniform.

557
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,640
So you flip a coin.

558
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,360
And depending on the outcome of
the coin, either you get a

559
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,530
certain value or you get a
value that ranges over a

560
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,360
continuous interval.

561
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,380
So what kind of random
variable is it?

562
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,280
Is it continuous?

563
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,100
Well, continuous random
variables assign 0 probability

564
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,180
to individual points.

565
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,020
Is it the case here?

566
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,680
No, because you have positive
probability of

567
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,740
obtaining 1/2 dollar.

568
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,040
So our random variable
is not continuous.

569
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,220
Is it discrete?

570
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,600
It's not discrete, because our
random variable can take

571
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,260
values also over a
continuous range.

572
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,780
So we call such a random
variable a

573
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,380
mixed random variable.

574
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:27,200
If you were to draw its
distribution very loosely,

575
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,740
probably you would want to draw
a picture like this one,

576
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,710
which kind of conveys the
idea of what's going on.

577
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,690
So just think of this as a
drawing of masses that are

578
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,840
sitting over a table.

579
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,940
We place an object that weighs
half a pound, but it's an

580
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,230
object that takes zero space.

581
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,720
So half a pound is just sitting
on top of that point.

582
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,980
And we take another half-pound
of probability and spread it

583
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,740
uniformly over that interval.

584
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,820
So this is like a piece that
comes from mass functions.

585
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,060
And that's a piece that looks
more like a density function.

586
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,920
And we just throw them together
in the picture.

587
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,150
I'm not trying to associate
any formal

588
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,310
meaning with this picture.

589
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:18,410
It's just a schematic of how
probabilities are distributed,

590
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,860
help us visualize
what's going on.

591
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:26,080
Now, if you have taken classes
on systems and all of that,

592
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,890
you may have seen the concept
of an impulse function.

593
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,630
And you my start saying that,
oh, I should treat this

594
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,190
mathematically as a so-called
impulse function.

595
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,400
But we do not need this for our
purposes in this class.

596
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,860
Just think of this as a nice
picture that conveys what's

597
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,200
going on in this particular
case.

598
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,740
So now, what would the CDF
look like in this case?

599
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,550
The CDF is always well defined,
no matter what kind

600
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,220
of random variable you have.

601
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,540
So the fact that it's not
continuous, it's not discrete

602
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,870
shouldn't be a problem as
long as we can calculate

603
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,120
probabilities of this kind.

604
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,600
So the probability of falling
to the left here is 0.

605
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,850
Once I start crossing there, the
probability of falling to

606
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,890
the left of a point increases
linearly with

607
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,610
how far I have gone.

608
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,900
So we get this linear
increase.

609
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,250
But as soon as I cross that
point, I accumulate another

610
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,220
1/2 unit of probability
instantly.

611
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,860
And once I accumulate that 1/2
unit, it means that my CDF is

612
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,320
going to have a jump of 1/2.

613
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,780
And then afterwards, I still
keep accumulating probability

614
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,760
at a fixed rate, the rate
being the density.

615
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,640
And I keep accumulating, again,
at a linear rate until

616
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,160
I settle to 1.

617
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,240
So this is a CDF that has
certain pieces where it

618
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,060
increases continuously.

619
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,280
And that corresponds to the
continuous part of our

620
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,390
randomize variable.

621
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,090
And it also has some places
where it has discrete jumps.

622
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,500
And those district jumps
correspond to places in which

623
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,990
we have placed a
positive mass.

624
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,780
And by the--

625
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,750
OK, yeah.

626
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,580
So this little 0 shouldn't
be there.

627
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,040
So let's cross it out.

628
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,780
All right.

629
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,830
So finally, we're going to take
the remaining time and

630
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,610
introduce our new friend.

631
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:23,080
It's going to be the Gaussian
or normal distribution.

632
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,690
So it's the most important
distribution there is in all

633
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,940
of probability theory.

634
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,230
It's plays a very
central role.

635
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,340
It shows up all over
the place.

636
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,870
We'll see later in the
class in more detail

637
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,450
why it shows up.

638
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:42,115
But the quick preview
is the following.

639
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:46,220
If you have a phenomenon in
which you measure a certain

640
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,970
quantity, but that quantity is
made up of lots and lots of

641
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,820
random contributions--

642
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,870
so your random variable is
actually the sum of lots and

643
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,570
lots of independent little
random variables--

644
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,290
then invariability, no matter
what kind of distribution the

645
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:08,260
little random variables have,
their sum will turn out to

646
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,500
have approximately a normal
distribution.

647
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,490
So this makes the normal
distribution to arise very

648
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,680
naturally in lots and
lots of contexts.

649
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,210
Whenever you have noise that's
comprised of lots of different

650
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:26,310
independent pieces of noise,
then the end result will be a

651
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,650
random variable that's normal.

652
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,250
So we are going to come back
to that topic later.

653
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,620
But that's the preview comment,
basically to argue

654
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,430
that it's an important one.

655
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:37,690
OK.

656
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,810
And there's a special case.

657
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,030
If you are dealing with a
binomial distribution, which

658
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,610
is the sum of lots of Bernoulli
random variables,

659
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,200
again you would expect that
the binomial would start

660
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,170
looking like a normal if you
have many, many-- a large

661
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,150
number of point fields.

662
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:53,530
All right.

663
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,560
So what's the math
involved here?

664
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:02,370
Let's parse the formula for
the density of the normal.

665
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:07,110
What we start with is the
function X squared over 2.

666
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,750
And if you are to plot X
squared over 2, it's a

667
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,840
parabola, and it has
this shape --

668
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,860
X squared over 2.

669
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,790
Then what do we do?

670
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:20,210
We take the negative exponential
of this.

671
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,600
So when X squared over
2 is 0, then negative

672
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,980
exponential is 1.

673
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,739
When X squared over 2 increases,
the negative

674
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:37,130
exponential of that falls off,
and it falls off pretty fast.

675
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,630
So as this goes up, the
formula for the

676
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,150
density goes down.

677
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:45,060
And because exponentials are
pretty strong in how quickly

678
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,530
they fall off, this means that
the tails of this distribution

679
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,370
actually do go down
pretty fast.

680
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:53,659
OK.

681
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:57,800
So that explains the shape
of the normal PDF.

682
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,340
How about this factor 1
over square root 2 pi?

683
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,540
Where does this come from?

684
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,760
Well, the integral has
to be equal to 1.

685
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,620
So you have to go and do your
calculus exercise and find the

686
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,350
integral of this the minus X
squared over 2 function and

687
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,240
then figure out, what constant
do I need to put in front so

688
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,250
that the integral
is equal to 1?

689
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,820
How do you evaluate
that integral?

690
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,760
Either you go to Mathematica
or Wolfram's Alpha or

691
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,340
whatever, and it tells
you what it is.

692
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,260
Or it's a very beautiful
calculus exercise that you may

693
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,050
have seen at some point.

694
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:42,190
You throw in another exponential
of this kind, you

695
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:46,520
bring in polar coordinates, and
somehow the answer comes

696
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,010
beautifully out there.

697
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,910
But in any case, this is the
constant that you need to make

698
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:56,070
it integrate to 1 and to be
a legitimate density.

699
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,550
We call this the standard
normal.

700
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:02,280
And for the standard normal,
what is the expected value?

701
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,780
Well, the symmetry, so
it's equal to 0.

702
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,490
What is the variance?

703
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,740
Well, here there's
no shortcut.

704
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,490
You have to do another
calculus exercise.

705
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:17,080
And you find that the variance
is equal to 1.

706
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,750
OK.

707
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:21,720
So this is a normal that's
centered around 0.

708
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,990
How about other types of normals
that are centered at

709
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,760
different places?

710
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,730
So we can do the same
kind of thing.

711
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:34,080
Instead of centering it at 0,
we can take some place where

712
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,640
we want to center it, write down
a quadratic such as (X

713
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,050
minus mu) squared, and then
take the negative

714
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,940
exponential of that.

715
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:53,790
And that gives us a normal
density that's centered at mu.

716
00:36:53,790 --> 00:37:01,190
Now, I may wish to control
the width of my density.

717
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,820
To control the width of my
density, equivalently I can

718
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,720
control the width
of my parabola.

719
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:15,430
If my parabola is narrower, if
my parabola looks like this,

720
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,990
what's going to happen
to the density?

721
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,550
It's going to fall
off much faster.

722
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:26,920
OK.

723
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,150
How do I make my parabola
narrower or wider?

724
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:35,300
I do it by putting in a
constant down here.

725
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,890
So by putting a sigma here, this
stretches or widens my

726
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,840
parabola by a factor of sigma.

727
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,540
Let's see.

728
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,780
Which way does it go?

729
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,330
If sigma is very small,
this is a big number.

730
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:55,080
My parabola goes up quickly,
which means my normal falls

731
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,730
off very fast.

732
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:02,630
So small sigma corresponds
to a narrower density.

733
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:08,870
And so it, therefore, should be
intuitive that the standard

734
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,520
deviation is proportional
to sigma.

735
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,380
Because that's the amount
by which you

736
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,080
are scaling the picture.

737
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,320
And indeed, the standard
deviation is sigma.

738
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,470
And so the variance
is sigma squared.

739
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:26,590
So all that we have done here
to create a general normal

740
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:31,180
with a given mean and variance
is to take this picture, shift

741
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,600
it in space so that the mean
sits at mu instead of 0, and

742
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,880
then scale it by a
factor of sigma.

743
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,130
This gives us a normal
with a given

744
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,560
mean and a given variance.

745
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,670
And the formula for
it is this one.

746
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,810
All right.

747
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,230
Now, normal random variables
have some wonderful

748
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,160
properties.

749
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,190
And one of them is that they
behave nicely when you take

750
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,740
linear functions of them.

751
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,190
So let's fix some constants
a and b, suppose that X is

752
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:13,840
normal, and look at this
linear function Y.

753
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,340
What is the expected
value of Y?

754
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,220
Here we don't need
anything special.

755
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,920
We know that the expected value
of a linear function is

756
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,690
the linear function of
the expectation.

757
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:30,570
So the expected value is this.

758
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,230
How about the variance?

759
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,430
We know that the variance of a
linear function doesn't care

760
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,910
about the constant term.

761
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,880
But the variance gets multiplied
by a squared.

762
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,880
So we get these variance, where
sigma squared is the

763
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,070
variance of the original
normal.

764
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:53,730
So have we used so far the
property that X is normal?

765
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,170
No, we haven't.

766
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:59,650
This calculation here is true
in general when you take a

767
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,650
linear function of a
random variable.

768
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:08,730
But if X is normal, we get the
other additional fact that Y

769
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,930
is also going to be normal.

770
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,300
So that's the nontrivial
part of the fact that

771
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,070
I'm claiming here.

772
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:19,700
So linear functions of normal
random variables are

773
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,020
themselves normal.

774
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,680
How do we convince ourselves
about it?

775
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,080
OK.

776
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,390
It's something that we will do
formerly in about two or three

777
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,390
lectures from today.

778
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,310
So we're going to prove it.

779
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:39,770
But if you think about it
intuitively, normal means this

780
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,070
particular bell-shaped curve.

781
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,550
And that bell-shaped curve could
be sitting anywhere and

782
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,910
could be scaled in any way.

783
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,190
So you start with a
bell-shaped curve.

784
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,370
If you take X, which is bell
shaped, and you multiply it by

785
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,500
a constant, what does that do?

786
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,260
Multiplying by a constant is
just like scaling the axis or

787
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,750
changing the units with which
you're measuring it.

788
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,880
So it will take a bell shape
and spread it or narrow it.

789
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,850
But it will still
be a bell shape.

790
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,440
And then when you add the
constant, you just take that

791
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,260
bell and move it elsewhere.

792
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,970
So under linear transformations,
bell shapes

793
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,360
will remain bell shapes, just
sitting at a different place

794
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,090
and with a different width.

795
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:30,490
And that sort of the intuition
of why normals remain normals

796
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,096
under this kind of
transformation.

797
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,770
So why is this useful?

798
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,960
Well, OK.

799
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,890
We have a formula
for the density.

800
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:43,750
But usually we want to calculate
probabilities.

801
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,760
How will you calculate
probabilities?

802
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,670
If I ask you, what's the
probability that the normal is

803
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,380
less than 3, how
do you find it?

804
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,830
You need to integrate the
density from minus

805
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,300
infinity up to 3.

806
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:03,230
Unfortunately, the integral of
the expression that shows up

807
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,720
that you would have to
calculate, an integral of this

808
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,690
kind from, let's say, minus
infinity to some number, is

809
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:16,270
something that's not known
in closed form.

810
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:23,490
So if you're looking for a
closed-form formula for this--

811
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,040
X bar--

812
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,890
if you're looking for a
closed-form formula that gives

813
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:32,010
you the value of this integral
as a function of X bar, you're

814
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,460
not going to find it.

815
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,150
So what can we do?

816
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,790
Well, since it's a useful
integral, we can

817
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,880
just tabulate it.

818
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,070
Calculate it once and for all,
for all values of X bar up to

819
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:50,440
some precision, and have
that table, and use it.

820
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,010
That's what one does.

821
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,885
OK, but now there is a catch.

822
00:42:54,885 --> 00:42:59,600
Are we going to write down a
table for every conceivable

823
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,870
type of normal distribution--

824
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,115
that is, for every possible
mean and every variance?

825
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:07,400
I guess that would be
a pretty long table.

826
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,540
You don't want to do that.

827
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,820
Fortunately, it's enough to
have a table with the

828
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:17,590
numerical values only for
the standard normal.

829
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,880
And once you have those, you can
use them in a clever way

830
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,000
to calculate probabilities for
the more general case.

831
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,090
So let's see how this is done.

832
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:30,610
So our starting point is that
someone has graciously

833
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:36,520
calculated for us the values
of the CDF, the cumulative

834
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,350
distribution function, that is
the probability of falling

835
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:44,120
below a certain point for
the standard normal

836
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,610
and at various places.

837
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,770
How do we read this table?

838
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:55,840
The probability that X is
less than, let's say,

839
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,170
0.63 is this number.

840
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:04,610
This number, 0.7357, is the
probability that the standard

841
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:08,070
normal is below 0.63.

842
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:11,377
So the table refers to
the standard normal.

843
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,600
But someone, let's say, gives
us some other numbers and

844
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,140
tells us we're dealing with a
normal with a certain mean and

845
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,530
a certain variance.

846
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,555
And we want to calculate the
probability that the value of

847
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:28,740
that random variable is less
than or equal to 3.

848
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,470
How are we going to do it?

849
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:36,210
Well, there's a standard trick,
which is so-called

850
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,480
standardizing a random
variable.

851
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,350
Standardizing a random variable

852
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,080
stands for the following.

853
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,490
You look at the random
variable, and you

854
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,280
subtract the mean.

855
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,690
This makes it a random
variable with 0 mean.

856
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:54,270
And then if I divide by the
standard deviation, what

857
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:58,220
happens to the variance of
this random variable?

858
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:03,860
Dividing by a number divides the
variance by sigma squared.

859
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,300
The original variance of
X was sigma squared.

860
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,740
So when I divide by sigma, I
end up with unit variance.

861
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:14,920
So after I do this
transformation, I get a random

862
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,190
variable that has 0 mean
and unit variance.

863
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,650
It is also normal.

864
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,580
Why is its normal?

865
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:28,890
Because this expression is a
linear function of the X that

866
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,120
I started with.

867
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,700
It's a linear function of a
normal random variable.

868
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,620
Therefore, it is normal.

869
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:37,090
And it is a standard normal.

870
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:41,460
So by taking a general normal
random variable and doing this

871
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:47,200
standardization, you end up
with a standard normal to

872
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,580
which you can then
apply the table.

873
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,180
Sometimes one calls this
the normalized score.

874
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,100
If you're thinking about test
results, how would you

875
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,780
interpret this number?

876
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:05,440
It tells you how many standard
deviations are you

877
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,900
away from the mean.

878
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,470
This is how much you are
away from the mean.

879
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,080
And you count it in terms
of how many standard

880
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,390
deviations it is.

881
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:19,680
So this number being equal to 3
tells you that X happens to

882
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,160
be 3 standard deviations
above the mean.

883
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,030
And I guess if you're looking
at your quiz scores, very

884
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:30,690
often that's the kind of number
that you think about.

885
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,130
So it's a useful quantity.

886
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,120
But it's also useful for doing
the calculation we're now

887
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,050
going to do.

888
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:40,910
So suppose that X has a mean of
2 and a variance of 16, so

889
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,600
a standard deviation of 4.

890
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,030
And we're going to calculate the
probability of this event.

891
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:49,900
This event is described in terms
of this X that has ugly

892
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,530
means and variances.

893
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:55,390
But we can take this event
and rewrite it as

894
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,070
an equivalent event.

895
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:01,470
X less than 3 is this same as
X minus 2 being less than 3

896
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:06,410
minus 2, which is the same as
this ratio being less than

897
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,440
that ratio.

898
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,460
So I'm subtracting from both
sides of the inequality the

899
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,170
mean and then dividing by
the standard deviation.

900
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,190
This event is the same
as that event.

901
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:19,430
Why do we like this
better than that?

902
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:23,670
We like it because this is the
standardized, or normalized,

903
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:28,660
version of X. We know that
this is standard normal.

904
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,650
And so we're asking the
question, what's the

905
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:34,130
probability that the standard
normal is less than this

906
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:37,300
number, which is 1/4?

907
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:45,380
So that's the key property, that
this is normal (0, 1).

908
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,470
And so we can look up now with
the table and ask for the

909
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:51,010
probability that the standard
normal random variable

910
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,170
is less than 0.25.

911
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,130
Where is that going to be?

912
00:47:55,130 --> 00:48:01,390
0.2, 0.25, it's here.

913
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:09,600
So the answer is 0.987.

914
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:15,570
So I guess this is just a drill
that you could learn in

915
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:16,190
high school.

916
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:18,990
You didn't have to come here
to learn about it.

917
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:22,030
But it's a drill that's very
useful when we will be

918
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,060
calculating normal probabilities
all the time.

919
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,300
So make sure you know how to
use the table and how to

920
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,350
massage a general normal
random variable into a

921
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:33,380
standard normal random
variable.

922
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:33,790
OK.

923
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:37,450
So just one more minute to look
at the big picture and

924
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:40,940
take stock of what we
have done so far

925
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,970
and where we're going.

926
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:47,840
Chapter 2 was this part of the
picture, where we dealt with

927
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,460
discrete random variables.

928
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,590
And this time, today, we
started talking about

929
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,410
continuous random variables.

930
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:00,305
And we introduced the density
function, which is the analog

931
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:03,160
of the probability
mass function.

932
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,790
We have the concepts
of expectation and

933
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:07,090
variance and CDF.

934
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:10,290
And this kind of notation
applies to both discrete and

935
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:11,720
continuous cases.

936
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:17,310
They are calculated the same way
in both cases except that

937
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:19,770
in the continuous case,
you use sums.

938
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:22,740
In the discrete case,
you use integrals.

939
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,320
So on that side, you
have integrals.

940
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,500
In this case, you have sums.

941
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,200
In this case, you always have
Fs in your formulas.

942
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,500
In this case, you always have
Ps in your formulas.

943
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,890
So what's there that's left
for us to do is to look at

944
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:42,460
these two concepts, joint
probability mass functions and

945
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:47,410
conditional mass functions, and
figure out what would be

946
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:51,080
the equivalent concepts on
the continuous side.

947
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,240
So we will need some notion of
a joint density when we're

948
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,510
dealing with multiple
random variables.

949
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:00,310
And we will also need the
concept of conditional

950
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,430
density, again for the case of
continuous random variables.

951
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,840
The intuition and the meaning
of these objects is going to

952
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:14,120
be exactly the same as here,
only a little subtler because

953
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,000
densities are not
probabilities.

954
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,630
They're rates at which
probabilities accumulate.

955
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:22,030
So that adds a little bit of
potential confusion here,

956
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:24,680
which, hopefully, we will fully
resolve in the next

957
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,490
couple of sections.

958
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,310
All right.

959
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,560
Thank you.
