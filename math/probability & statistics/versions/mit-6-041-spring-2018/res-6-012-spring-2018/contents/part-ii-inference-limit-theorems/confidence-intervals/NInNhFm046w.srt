1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,150
In this segment we introduce
the concept of

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,120
a confidence interval.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,109
The starting point is that an
estimate, the value of an

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,110
estimator, does not tell
the whole story.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,910
One option is to also provide
the standard error of the

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,290
estimator, but a more common
practice is to report a

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,910
confidence interval.

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,040
What is that?

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,060
We'll introduce the notion
of a confidence

10
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,740
interval through a story.

11
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,910
You're working for a
polling company.

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,520
You carry out a poll, and then
you go and report to your boss

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:38,000
that my estimate is this
particular number.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,620
And then your boss says, I
appreciate the five digit

15
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,510
accuracy, but are your
conclusions that accurate?

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,240
You go back to your desk, you do
some more calculations, and

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,880
then you tell your boss, here is
a 95% confidence interval.

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,930
Your boss tells you, that looks
great, but what does

19
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,570
that exactly mean?

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,980
You go back to your textbook,
you pull out the definition,

21
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,420
and you reply as follows.

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,130
Well, a 95% confidence
interval--

23
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,550
so here I am letting
alpha to be 5%--

24
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,800
a 95% confidence interval is
an interval that has the

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,360
following property.

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,710
That the unknown value of the
parameter that we're trying to

27
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,060
estimate falls inside
this interval with

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,320
probability at least 95%.

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,390
And if you wish, I could also
let alpha be equal to 1%, in

30
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,630
which case I could give you
a 99% confidence interval.

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,220
Your boss replies, no,
that sounds good.

32
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,920
A 95% interval sounds fine.

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,310
And your boss goes out to
the press, holds a press

34
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,740
conference, and reports that
the true value of the

35
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,490
parameter lies inside this
range, inside the reported

36
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,627
confidence interval with
probability at least 95%.

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,610
Does this statement
make sense?

38
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,220
Actually, no.

39
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,300
This statement is the most
common misconception of what a

40
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,740
confidence interval is.

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,790
To see why this statement
does not make

42
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,030
sense, look at it carefully.

43
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,880
We're talking about the
probability of something.

44
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,460
But that something does not
involve anything random.

45
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,300
0.3 and 0.52 are just numbers.

46
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,079
And theta is also a number which
we do not know what it

47
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,816
is, but it is not random.

48
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,650
It is a constant.

49
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,350
So this statement is incorrect
on a purely syntactic basis.

50
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,370
I mean the true parameter theta
either is inside this

51
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,190
interval, or it is not.

52
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,640
But there's nothing random here,
and so this statement

53
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,980
does not make sense.

54
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,070
Instead, let us look carefully
at this definition.

55
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,810
This statement does make
sense because it

56
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,230
involves random variables.

57
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,150
The lower and the upper end of
the confidence interval are

58
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,140
quantities that are determined
by the data, and therefore

59
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,530
they are random.

60
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,400
So we do have random
variables in here.

61
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,160
And so it makes sense to talk
about probabilities.

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,590
To really understand what's
going on, think as follows.

63
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,860
We're dealing with a poll that
is trying to estimate some

64
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,860
unknown value, theta.

65
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,860
You carry out the poll, and you
come up with a confidence

66
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,990
interval based on the data.

67
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,820
You might be lucky, and your
confidence interval happens to

68
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,100
capture the true parameter.

69
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,579
You carry the poll one more
time, maybe on another day.

70
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:55,170
You come up with another
confidence interval.

71
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,360
And you're again lucky, and it
captures the true parameter.

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,260
You carry it on another day,
and you come up with a

73
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,550
confidence interval.

74
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,770
And maybe the data that you
got were kind of skewed.

75
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,010
You were unlucky, and your
confidence interval does not

76
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,750
capture the true parameter.

77
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,870
Having a 95% confidence interval
means that 95% of the

78
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:24,980
time, 95% of the polls that you
carry out will capture the

79
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,380
true parameter.

80
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,190
So the word 95% really talks
about your method of

81
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,490
constructing confidence
intervals.

82
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,850
It's a method that 95%
of the time will

83
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,590
capture the true parameter.

84
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,380
It is not a statement about the
actual numbers that you

85
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,040
are reporting on one
specific poll.

86
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,190
So it is important to keep this
in mind, and to always

87
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,700
interpret confidence intervals
the correct way.

88
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,909
So how does one come up with
confidence intervals?

89
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:59,240
The most common method
is based on normal

90
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,140
approximations, as we
will be seeing next.
