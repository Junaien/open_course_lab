1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,610
We now develop a methodology for
finding the PDF of the sum

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,760
of two independent random
variables, when these random

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,710
variables are continuous
with known PDFs.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,780
So in that case, Z will
also be continuous and

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,530
so will have a PDF.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,430
The development is quite
analogous to the one for the

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,340
discrete case.

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,100
And in the discrete
case, we obtained

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,090
this convolution formula.

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,980
This convolution formula
corresponds to a summation

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,050
over all ways that a certain
sum can be realized.

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,520
In this picture, these are all
the ways that the sum of 3 can

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,930
be realized.

14
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,400
In the continuous case, the
different ways that the

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,340
constant sum can be realized
corresponds to a line.

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,370
So this is a line in which X
plus Y is equal to a constant.

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,890
And we need to somehow add over
all the possible ways

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,330
that the sum can be obtained,
add over all the

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,850
points on this line.

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,970
Now, when we're summing over all
the points of the line we

21
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,480
really need to employ
an integral.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,220
And this leads to the following

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,050
guess for the formula.

24
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,840
Instead of having a summation,
we will have an integral.

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,120
And the integral is over all the
X, Y pairs whose sum is a

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,510
constant number, little z.

27
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,860
So we have here the
family recipe--

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,235
that sums are replaced by
integrals and PMFs are

29
00:01:30,235 --> 00:01:31,870
replaced by PDFs.

30
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,030
So this formula is entirely
plausible.

31
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,250
And it is called the

32
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,140
continuous convolution formula.

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,750
What we want to do next is to
actually justify this formula

34
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,770
more rigorously.

35
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,890
We will use the following
trick.

36
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,310
We will first condition on the
random variable X, taking on a

37
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,850
specific value.

38
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,080
If we do this conditioning,
then the random variable Z

39
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:06,110
becomes little x plus Y. And
to make the argument more

40
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,070
transparent, we're going to look
first at the special case

41
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,120
where little x is let's
say, the number 3.

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,400
In which case our random
variable Z is

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,300
equal to Y plus 3.

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,990
Let us now calculate the
conditional PDF of Z in a

45
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,020
universe in which we are told
that the random variable X

46
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,300
takes on the value of 3.

47
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,440
Now, given that X takes on the
value of 3, the random

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,570
variable Z is the same as the
random variable Y plus 3.

49
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,270
And now we have the conditional
PDF of y plus 3

50
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,360
given X.

51
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,120
However, we have assumed that
X and Y are independent.

52
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,180
So the conditional PDF is going
to be the same as the

53
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,400
unconditional PDF of Y plus 3.

54
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,720
And we obtain this expression.

55
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,030
Now, what is this?

56
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,410
We know the PDF of Y. But now
we want the PDF of Y plus 3,

57
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,550
which is a simple version of a
linear function of a single

58
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,940
random variable Y. For a linear
function of this form,

59
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,070
we have already derived
a formula.

60
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,530
In the notation we have used
in the past, if we have a

61
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:42,610
random variable X, and we add
the constant to it, the PDF of

62
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:48,240
the new random variable is the
PDF of X but shifted by an

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,230
amount equal to b
to the right.

64
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,370
And that's what the shifting
corresponds to mathematically.

65
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,930
Now, let's us apply this
formula to the case

66
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,400
that we have here.

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,440
We need to keep track of
the different symbols.

68
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,700
So capital Y corresponds to X,
b corresponds to 3, little x

69
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,780
corresponds to Z. And by using
these correspondences, what we

70
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:18,329
obtain is f sub Y of this
argument, which is Z in our

71
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,100
case minus b, which
is 3 in our case.

72
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,990
And this is the final form for
the conditional density of Z

73
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,530
given that X takes
a specific value.

74
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,140
It's nothing more than the
density of Y, but shifted by 3

75
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,100
units to the right.

76
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,840
Let us now generalize this.

77
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,830
Instead of using X equal to 3,
let us use a general number.

78
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,390
And this gives us the more
general formula, that the

79
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:53,090
conditional PDF of Z given that
X takes on a specific

80
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,460
value is equal to--

81
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,600
just use little x here
instead of 3.

82
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,110
It takes this form.

83
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,510
So we do have now in our hands
a formula for the conditional

84
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,850
density of Z given X.

85
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:15,040
Since we have the conditional,
and we also know the PDF of X,

86
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,520
we can use the multiplication
rule to find the joint PDF of

87
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:28,710
X and Z. By the multiplication
rule, it is the marginal PDF

88
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:34,130
of X times the conditional PDF
of Z given X, which in our

89
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,530
case takes this particular
form.

90
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,830
And now that we have the joint
PDF in our hands, we can use

91
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,420
another familiar formula
that takes us from the

92
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,060
joint to the marginal.

93
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,010
It would take the joint PDF and
integrate with respect to

94
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,690
one argument, we obtain the
marginal PDF of the other

95
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,370
random variable.

96
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,860
Using this specific form that
we have for the joint PDF in

97
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,320
this formula, we have finally
obtained this expression.

98
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,120
This is the integral of the
joint PDF of X with Z

99
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,370
integrated over all xs.

100
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,910
And this proves this convolution
formula.

101
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,350
In terms of the mechanics of
carrying out the calculation

102
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,500
of the convolution, the
mechanics are exactly the same

103
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,180
as in the discrete case.

104
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,090
If you want to solve a problem
graphically, what you will do

105
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:36,300
is to take the PDF of Y, flip
it horizontally, and then

106
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,070
shift it by an amount of little
z, cross multiply

107
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,760
terms, and integrate them out.
