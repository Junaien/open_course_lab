1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,350
In this segment, we justify some
of the property is that

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,230
the correlation coefficient
that we

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,780
claimed a little earlier.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,560
The most important properties of
the correlation coefficient

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,780
lies between minus
1 and plus 1.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,950
We will prove this property for
the special case where we

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,950
have random variables with zero
means and unit variances.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,670
So standard deviations are also
1, so most of the terms

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,560
here disappear and the
correlation coefficient is

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,690
simply the expected value
of X times Y.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,280
We will show that in this
special case the expected

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,370
value of X times Y lies
between minus 1 and 1.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,630
But the proof of this fact
remains valid with a little

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,790
bit of more algebra along
similar lines

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,501
for the general case.

16
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:53,350
What we will do is we will
consider this quantity here

17
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,200
and expand this quadratic
and write it as

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,790
expected value of X squared.

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,160
Then there's a cross term,
which is minus 2 rho, the

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:10,070
expected value of X times Y,
plus rho squared, expected

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,560
value of Y squared.

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,840
Now since we assume that the
random variables have 0 mean,

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,370
this is the same as the variance
and we assume that

24
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:25,100
the variance is 1, so this
term here is equal to 1.

25
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,050
Now, the expected value of X
times Y is the same as the

26
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,170
correlation coefficient
in this case.

27
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,190
So we have minus 2 rho
squared and from

28
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,870
here we have rho squared.

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,030
And by the previous argument,
again this quantity, according

30
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,740
to our assumptions, is equal to
1 so we're left with this

31
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,830
expression, which is 1
minus rho squared.

32
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,979
Now, notice that this is the
expectation of a non-negative

33
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,210
random variable so this
quantity here must be

34
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,560
non-negative.

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,470
Therefore, 1 minus rho squared
is non-negative, which means

36
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,850
that rho squared is less
than or equal to 1.

37
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,230
And that's the same as requiring
that rho lie between

38
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,820
minus 1 and plus 1.

39
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,310
And so we have established this
important property, at

40
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,150
least for the special case of
0 means and unit variances.

41
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,250
But as I mentioned, it remains
valid more generally.

42
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,920
Now let us look at an extreme
case, when the absolute value

43
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,410
of rho is equal to 1.

44
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,986
What happens in this case?

45
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:43,410
In that case, this term is 0
and this implies that the

46
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,870
expected value of the square
of this random variable is

47
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,250
equal to 0.

48
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,770
Now here we have a non-negative
random variable,

49
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,390
and its expected value is 0,
which means that when we

50
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,470
calculate the expected value
of this there will be no

51
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,710
positive contributions and so
the only contributions must be

52
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,000
equal to 0.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,100
This means that X minus rho Y
has to be equal to 0 with

54
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,860
probability 1.

55
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:17,260
So X is going to be equal to
rho times Y and this will

56
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,700
happen with essential
certainty.

57
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,250
Now also because the absolute
value overall is equal to 1,

58
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:30,490
this means that we have either
X equal to Y or X equals to

59
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,210
minus Y, in case rho is
equal to minus 1.

60
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,100
So we see that if the
correlation coefficient has an

61
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,280
absolute value of 1, then X
and Y are related to each

62
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,620
other according to a simple
linear relation, and it's an

63
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,579
extreme form of dependence
between

64
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:50,829
the two random variables.
