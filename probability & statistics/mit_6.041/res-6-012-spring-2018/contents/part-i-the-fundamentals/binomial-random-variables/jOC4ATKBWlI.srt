1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,830
The next random variable that
we will discuss is the

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,560
binomial random variable.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,570
It is one that is
already familiar

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,380
to us in most respects.

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,190
It is associated with the
experiment of taking a coin

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,510
and tossing it n times
independently.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,100
And at each toss, there
is a probability, p,

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,590
of obtaining heads.

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,120
So the experiment is completely
specified in terms

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,270
of two parameters--

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,470
n, the number of tosses, and p,
the probability of heads at

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,549
each one of the tosses.

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,830
We can represent this experiment
by the usual

14
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,020
sequential tree diagram.

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,490
And the leaves of the tree are
the possible outcomes of the

16
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,440
experiment.

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,640
So these are the elements
of the sample space.

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,585
And a typical outcome is a
particular sequence of heads

19
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:52,190
and tails that has length n.

20
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,890
In this diagram here, we took
n to be equal to 3.

21
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,120
We can now define a random
variable associated with this

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,720
experiment.

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,660
Our random variable that we
denote by capital X is the

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,370
number of heads that
are observed.

25
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,950
So for example, if the outcome
happens to be this one--

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,900
tails, heads, heads-- we have
2 heads that are observed.

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,200
And the numerical value of our
random variable is equal to 2.

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,580
In general, this random
variable, a binomial random

29
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,500
variable, can be used to model
any kind of situation in which

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,200
we have a fixed number of
independent trials and

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,160
identical trials, and each trial
can result in success or

32
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,539
failure, and we have a
probability of success equal

33
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,880
to some given number, p.

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,440
The number of successes obtained
in these trials is,

35
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,000
of course, random and
it is modeled by a

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,800
binomial random variable.

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,979
We can now proceed and calculate
the PMF of this

38
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,220
random variable.

39
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,140
Instead of calculating the whole
PMF, let us look at just

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,000
one typical entry of the PMF.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,259
Let's look at this entry, which,
by definition, is the

42
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:14,990
probability that our random
variable takes the value of 2.

43
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,840
Now, the random variable taking
the numerical value of

44
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,030
2, this is an event that can
happen in three possible ways

45
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,840
that we can identify in
the sample space.

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,150
We can have 2 heads followed
by a tail.

47
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,990
We can have heads,
tails, heads.

48
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:39,460
Or we can have tails,
heads, heads.

49
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,150
The probability of this
outcome is p times p

50
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,690
times (1 minus p).

51
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,230
So it's p squared times
(1 minus p).

52
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,660
And the other two outcomes
also have the same

53
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,050
probability, so the overall
probability is 3 times this.

54
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,250
Which can also be written this
way, 3 is the same as

55
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,060
3-choose-2.

56
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,050
It's the number of ways that you
can choose 2 heads, where

57
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,930
they will be placed
in a sequence of

58
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,940
3 slots or 3 trials.

59
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,660
More generally, we have the
familiar binomial formula.

60
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,530
So this is a formula that
you have already seen.

61
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,180
It's the probability of
obtaining k successes in a

62
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,180
sequence of n independent
trials.

63
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,160
The only thing that is new is
that instead of using the

64
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,130
traditional probability
notation, now

65
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,020
we're using PMF notation.

66
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,750
To get a feel for the binomial
PMF, it's instructive to look

67
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,890
at some plots.

68
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,670
So suppose that we toss the coin
three times and that the

69
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,510
coin tosses are fair, so that
the probability of heads is

70
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,180
equal to 1/2.

71
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,930
Then we see that 1 head or 2
heads are equally likely, and

72
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:59,100
they are more likely than the
outcome of 0 or 3 heads.

73
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,860
Now, if we change the number of
tosses and toss the coin 10

74
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,260
times, then we see that
the most likely result

75
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,050
is to have 5 heads.

76
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,660
And then as we move away from
5 in either direction, the

77
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,920
probability of that
particular result

78
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,250
becomes smaller and smaller.

79
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,840
Now, if we toss the coin many
times, let's say 100 times,

80
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,250
the coin is still fair, then
we see that the number of

81
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,350
heads that we're going to get is
most likely to be somewhere

82
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,810
in this range between,
let's say, 35 and 65.

83
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,750
These are values of the random
variable that have some

84
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,820
noticeable or high
probabilities.

85
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,710
But anything below 30 or
anything about 70 is extremely

86
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,240
unlikely to occur.

87
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,360
We can generate similar plots
for unfair coins.

88
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,360
So suppose now that our coin is
biased and the probability

89
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,610
of heads is quite low,
equal to 0.2.

90
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,680
In that case, the most likely
result is that we're going to

91
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,640
see 0 heads.

92
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,740
And then, there's smaller and
smaller probability of

93
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,440
obtaining more heads.

94
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,740
On the other hand, if we toss
the coin 10 times, we expect

95
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,320
to see a few heads, not a very
large number, but some number

96
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,210
of heads between, let's
say, 0 and 4.

97
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,210
Finally, if we toss the coin 100
times and we take the coin

98
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,690
to be an extremely unfair one,
what do we expect to see?

99
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,220
If we think of probabilities as
frequencies, we expect to

100
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,010
see heads roughly
10% of the time.

101
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:48,190
So, given that n is 100, we
expect to see about 10 heads.

102
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,460
But when we say about
10 heads, we do not

103
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,659
mean exactly 10 heads.

104
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:57,480
About 10 heads, in this
instance, as this plot tells

105
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,440
us, is any number more or less
in the range from 0 to 20.

106
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,650
But anything above 20 is
extremely unlikely.
