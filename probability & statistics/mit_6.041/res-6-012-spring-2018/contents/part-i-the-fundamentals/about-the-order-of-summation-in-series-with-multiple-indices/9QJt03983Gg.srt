1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,410
We now continue our discussion
of infinite series.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,350
Sometimes we have to deal with
series where the terms being

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,710
added are indexed by multiple
indices, as in

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,220
this example here.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,710
We're given numbers, aij,
and i ranges over all

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,390
the positive integers.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,910
j also ranges over all the
positive integers.

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,250
So what does this
sum represent?

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,480
We can think of it as follows.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,330
We have here a two-dimensional
grid that corresponds to all

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,750
the pairs (i,j).

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,290
And in essence, each one of
those points corresponds to

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,280
one of the terms that
we want to add.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,840
So we can sum the different
terms in some arbitrary order.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,430
Let's say we start from here.

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,950
Take that term, add this term,
then add this term here, then

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,570
add this term, then the next
term, next term, and so on.

18
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,640
And we can keep going that
way, adding the different

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,850
terms according to
some sequence.

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,220
So essentially, what we're doing
here is we're taking

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,470
this two-dimensional grid and
arranging the terms associated

22
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,950
with that grid, in some
particular linear order.

23
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,090
And we're summing those
terms in sequence.

24
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:25,220
As long as this sum converges to
something as we keep adding

25
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,010
more and more terms, then
this double series

26
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,800
will be well defined.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,930
Notice, however, we can
add those terms in

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,100
many different orders.

29
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,320
And in principle, those
different orders might give us

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,490
different kinds of results.

31
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,979
On the other hand, as long as
the sum of the absolute values

32
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:54,090
of all the terms turns out to be
finite, then the particular

33
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,190
order in which we're adding the
different terms will turn

34
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,240
out that it doesn't matter.

35
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,620
There's another way that we can
add the terms together,

36
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,500
and this is the following.

37
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,860
Let us consider fixing a
particular choice of i, and

38
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,000
adding all of the terms that
are associated with this

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,300
particular choice of i, as j
ranges from 1 to infinity.

40
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,980
So what we're doing is we're
taking the summation from j

41
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:37,160
equal to 1 to infinity, while
keeping the value of i fixed.

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,450
We do this for every
possible i.

43
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,970
So for every possible i,
we're going to get

44
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,810
a particular number.

45
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,360
And then we take the numbers
that we obtain for the

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,170
different choices if i, so i
ranges from 1 to infinity.

47
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,700
And we add all those
terms together.

48
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,230
So this is one particular order,
one particular way of

49
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,720
doing the infinite summation.

50
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,600
Now, why start with the
summation over j's while

51
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,090
keeping i fixed?

52
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,790
There's no reason for that.

53
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,410
We could also carry out the
summation by fixing a

54
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,880
particular choice of j and
summing over all i's.

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,500
So now it is i that ranges
from 1 to infinity.

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,650
And we look at this
infinite sum.

57
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,170
This is the infinite
sum of those terms.

58
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,780
We obtain one such infinite
sum for every choice of j.

59
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,720
And then we take that sum that
we obtain for any particular

60
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,880
choice of j, and add
over the different

61
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,860
possible values of j.

62
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,510
So j goes from 1 to infinity.

63
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,700
This is a different way of
carrying out the summation.

64
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,490
And these are going to give us
the same result, and the same

65
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,610
result that we would also obtain
if we were to add the

66
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,060
terms in this particular order,
as long as the double

67
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,020
series is well-defined, in
the following sense.

68
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,030
If we have a guarantee that the
sum of the absolute values

69
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,970
of those numbers is finite, no
matter which way we add them,

70
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,110
then it turns out that we can
use any particular order to

71
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,810
add the terms in the series.

72
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,750
We're going to get
the same result.

73
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,540
And we can also carry out the
double summation by doing--

74
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,440
by adding over one
index at a time.

75
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,540
A word of caution--

76
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,690
this condition is not
always satisfied.

77
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,970
And in those cases, strange
things can happen.

78
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:49,620
Suppose that the sequences we're
dealing with, the aij's,

79
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,110
take those particular values
indicated in this picture.

80
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,450
And all the remaining terms, the
aij's associated with the

81
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,150
other dots, are all 0's.

82
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,930
So all these terms out
there will be 0's.

83
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:12,230
If we carry out the summation by
fixing a j and adding over

84
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:19,270
all i's, what we get here is 0,
and a 0, and a 0, and a 0.

85
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:24,020
That's because in each row we
have a 1 and a minus 1, which

86
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,560
cancel out and give us 0's.

87
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,960
So if we carry out the summation
in this manner, we

88
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,940
get a sum of 0's, which is 0.

89
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,540
But if we carry out the
summation in this order, fix

90
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,380
an i, and then add over all j's,
the first term that we

91
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,270
get here is going to be 1,
because in this column, this

92
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,980
is the only non-zero number.

93
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,510
And then in the remaining
columns, as we add the terms,

94
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,060
we're going to get 0's,
and 0's, and so on.

95
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,970
And so if we carry out the
summation in this way, we

96
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,500
obtain a 1.

97
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,010
So this is an example that shows
you that the order of

98
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,670
summation actually may matter.

99
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,160
In this example, the sum of the
absolute values of all of

100
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,780
the terms that are involved is
infinity, because we have

101
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,780
infinitely many plus or minus
1's, so this condition here is

102
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,210
not satisfied in this example.

103
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,110
Let us now consider the case
where we want to add the terms

104
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,800
of a double sequence, but over
a limited range of indices as

105
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,490
in this example, where we have
coefficients aij, which we

106
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,690
want to add, but only for those
i's and j's for which j

107
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,580
is less than or equal to i.

108
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,420
Graphically, this means that we
only want to consider the

109
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,909
pairs shown in this picture.

110
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:04,470
So these points here correspond
to i,j pairs for

111
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,690
which i is equal to j.

112
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,200
Terms on the right, or points
to the right, correspond to

113
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,400
i,j pairs for which i is
at least as large as j.

114
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,550
We can carry out this summation
in two ways.

115
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,740
One way is the following.

116
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,720
We fix a value of i, and
we consider all of the

117
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,550
corresponding terms, that
correspond to different

118
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,640
choices of j.

119
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:37,320
But we only go up to the point
where i is equal to j.

120
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,230
This is the largest term.

121
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,159
So what are we doing here?

122
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:46,960
We're taking the coefficients
aij, and we are adding over

123
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,360
all j's, starting from 1, which

124
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,840
corresponds to this term.

125
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,560
And j goes up to the point where
it becomes equal to i.

126
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,330
We do this for every
value of i.

127
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,470
And so we get a number for the
sum of each one of the

128
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,650
columns, and then we add
those numbers together.

129
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,350
So we're adding over all
i's, and i ranges

130
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,300
from 1 up to infinity.

131
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,670
This is one way of carrying
out the summation.

132
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,770
Alternatively, we could fix a
value of j, and consider doing

133
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,090
the summation over
all choices of i.

134
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,039
So this corresponds to
the sum over all

135
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,169
choices of i, from where?

136
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,690
The smallest term, the first
term, happens when i is equal

137
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,780
to the value of j.

138
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,610
And then we have larger choices
of i, numbers for

139
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,880
which i is bigger than the
corresponding value of j.

140
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,460
And so i ranges from j all
the way to infinity.

141
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,260
And this is the sum over one of
the rows in this diagram.

142
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,140
We do this for every j.

143
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,130
We get a result, and then
we need to add all

144
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,840
those results together.

145
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:15,170
So we're summing for all j's
from 1 up to infinity.

146
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,050
So these are two different ways
that we can evaluate this

147
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,550
series associated with
a double sequence.

148
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,060
We can either add over all j's
first and then over i's, or we

149
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,960
can sum over all i's first,
and then over all j's.

150
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,010
The two ways of approaching this
problem, this summation,

151
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,210
should give us the
same answer.

152
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,210
And this is going to be, again,
subject to the usual

153
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,440
qualification.

154
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,830
As long as the sum of the
absolute values of the terms

155
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,320
that we're trying to add
is less than infinity--

156
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,800
if this condition is true, then
the two ways of carrying

157
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,650
out the summation are equal, and
they're just two different

158
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,900
alternatives.
