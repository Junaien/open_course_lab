1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,590
In this segment, we will discuss
what a sequence is and

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,480
what it means for a sequence
to converge.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,580
So a sequence is nothing but
some collection of elements

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,650
that are coming out of some set,
and that collection of

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,690
elements is indexed by
the natural numbers.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:27,530
We often use the notation, and
we say that we have a sequence

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,510
ai, or sometimes we use the
notation that we have a

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,830
sequence of this kind to
emphasize the fact that it's a

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,780
sequence and not just
a single number.

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,260
And what we mean by this is that
we have i, an index that

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,470
runs over the natural numbers,
which is the set of positive

12
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:57,110
integers, and each ai is
an element of some set.

13
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,460
In many cases, the set is going
to be just the real

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,890
line, in which case we're
dealing with a sequence of

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,099
real numbers.

16
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,030
But it is also possible that
the set over which our

17
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,000
sequence takes values is
Euclidean space n-dimensional

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,710
space, in which case
we're dealing with

19
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,230
a sequence of vectors.

20
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,300
But it also could be any
other kind of set.

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,410
Now, the definition that
I gave you may

22
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,950
still be a little vague.

23
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,460
You may wonder how a
mathematician would define

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,170
formally a sequence.

25
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:36,830
Formally, what a sequence is,
is just a function that, to

26
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:44,700
any natural number, associates
an element of S. In

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,920
particular, if we evaluate the
function f at some argument i,

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,570
this gives us the ith element
of the sequence.

29
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,590
So that's what a sequence is.

30
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,780
Now, about sequences, we
typically care whether a

31
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,500
sequence converges to some
number a, and we often use

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,360
this notation.

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,940
But to make it more precise,
you also add

34
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,630
this notation here.

35
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,520
And we read this as saying
that as i converges to

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,460
infinity, the sequence
ai converges to a

37
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,360
certain number a.

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,380
A more formal mathematical
notation would be the limit as

39
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:32,470
i goes to infinity of ai is
equal to a certain number, a.

40
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,370
But what exactly
does this mean?

41
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,329
What does it mean for a
sequence to converge?

42
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:39,550
What is the formal definition?

43
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,180
It is as follows.

44
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,050
Let us plot the sequence
as a function of i.

45
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:52,220
So this is the i-axis, and here
we plot entries of ai.

46
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,670
For a sequence to converge to a
certain number a, we need to

47
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,820
the following to happen.

48
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:06,070
If we draw a small band around
that number a, what we want is

49
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:11,440
that the elements of the
sequence, as i increases,

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,140
eventually get inside
this band and stay

51
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,020
inside that band forever.

52
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,579
Now, let us turn this into
a more precise statement.

53
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,600
What we mean is the following.

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,920
If I give you some positive
number epsilon, and I'm going

55
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,790
to use that positive number
epsilon to define a band

56
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,820
around the number a.

57
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,810
So it's this band here.

58
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,150
If I give you a positive number
epsilon, and therefore,

59
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,890
this way, have defined a certain
band, there exists a

60
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,430
time after which the entries
will get the inside the band.

61
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,390
In this picture, it would
be this time.

62
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,175
So there exists a time--

63
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,470
let's call that time i0--

64
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:24,490
so i0 is here such that after
that time, what we have is

65
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,430
that the element of
the sequence is

66
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,560
within epsilon of a.

67
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,130
So this is the formal definition
of convergence of a

68
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,120
sequence to a certain
number a.

69
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,890
The definition may look
formidable and difficult to

70
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,230
parse, but what it
says in plain

71
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,980
English is pretty simple.

72
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,150
No matter what kind of band
I take around my limit a,

73
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,570
eventually, the sequence will
be inside this band and will

74
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,050
stay inside there.

75
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,700
Convergence of sequences has
some very nice properties that

76
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,400
you're probably familiar with.

77
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,580
For example, if I tell you
that a certain sequence

78
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,670
converges to a number a and
another sequence converges to

79
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:17,800
a number b, then we will have
that ai plus bi, which is a

80
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,650
new sequence--

81
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,340
the ith element of the sequence
is this sum--

82
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,010
will converge to a plus b.

83
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,720
Or similarly, ai times bi, which
is another sequence,

84
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,180
converges to a times b.

85
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:41,880
And if, in addition, g is a
continuous function, then g of

86
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,840
ai will converge to g of a.

87
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,890
So for example, if the ais
converge to a, then the

88
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,700
sequence ai squared is going
to converge to a squared.
