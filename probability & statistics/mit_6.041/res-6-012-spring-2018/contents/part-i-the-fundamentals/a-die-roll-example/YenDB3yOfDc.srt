1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,670
This is a simple example where
we want to just apply the

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,630
formula for conditional
probabilities

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,610
and see what we get.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,140
The example involves a
four-sided die, if you can

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,300
imagine such an object, which
we roll twice, and we record

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,830
the first roll, and
the second roll.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,660
So there are 16 possible
outcomes.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,350
We assume to keep things simple,
that each one of those

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,820
16 possible outcomes, each
one of them has the same

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,800
probability, so each outcome
has the probability 1/16.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,250
Let us consider now a particular
event B on which

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,460
we're going to condition.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,286
This is the event under which
the smaller of the two die

14
00:00:49,286 --> 00:00:53,990
rolls is equal to 2, which means
that one of the dice

15
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,970
must have resulted in two, and
the other die has resulted in

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,220
something which is
2 or larger.

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,800
So this can happen
in multiple ways.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,130
And here are the different
ways that it can happen.

19
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:14,100
So at 2, 2, or 2, 3, or 2, 4;
then a 3, 2 and a 4, 2.

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,080
All of these are outcomes in
which one of the dice has a

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,200
value equal to 2, and
the other die

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,880
is at least as large.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,560
So we condition on this event.

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,520
This results in a conditional
model where each one of those

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,820
five outcomes are equally likely
since they used to be

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,759
equally likely in the
original model.

27
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,539
Now let's look at
this quantity.

28
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:41,340
The maximum of the
two die rolls--

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,960
that is, the largest
of the results.

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,710
And let us try to calculate
the following quantity--

31
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,240
the conditional probability that
the maximum is equal to 1

32
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,420
given that the minimum
is equal to 2.

33
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,820
So this is the conditional
probability of

34
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,050
this particular outcome.

35
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,480
Well, this particular outcome
cannot happen.

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,450
If I tell you that the smaller
number is 2, then the larger

37
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,669
number cannot be equal to 1, so
this outcome is impossible,

38
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,870
and therefore this conditional
probability is equal to 0.

39
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,550
Let's do something a little
more interesting.

40
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,910
Let us now look at the
conditional probability that

41
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,690
the maximum is equal to 3 given
the information that

42
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,190
event B has occurred.

43
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,210
It's best to draw a picture
and see what that event

44
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,990
corresponds to.

45
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,829
M is equal to 3--

46
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:38,110
the maximum is equal to 3--

47
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:44,500
if one of the dice resulted
in a 3, and the other die

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,190
resulted in something
that's 3 or less.

49
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,770
So this event here corresponds
to the blue

50
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,630
region in this diagram.

51
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,610
Now let us try to calculate the
conditional probability by

52
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,110
just following the definition.

53
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,910
The conditional probability of
one event given another is the

54
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,860
probability that
both of them--

55
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,900
both of the two events--

56
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,810
occur, divided by the
probability of the

57
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,690
conditioning event.

58
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,880
That is, out of the total
probability in the

59
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,000
conditioning event, we ask,
what fraction of that

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,060
probability is assigned to
outcomes in which the event of

61
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,730
interest is also happening?

62
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,200
So what is this event?

63
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,100
The maximum is equal to 3,
which is the blue event.

64
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,500
And simultaneously, the red
event is happening.

65
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,840
These two events intersect
only in two places.

66
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,020
This is the intersection
of the two events.

67
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:58,480
And the probability of that
intersection is 2 out of 16,

68
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,720
since there's 16 outcomes and
that event happens only with

69
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,910
two particular outcomes.

70
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,360
So this gives us 2/16
in the numerator.

71
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,210
How about the denominator?

72
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,990
Event B consists of a total
of five possible outcomes.

73
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:20,360
Each one has probability 1/16,
so this is 5/16, so the final

74
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,860
answer is 2/5.

75
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,470
We could have gotten that same
answer in a simple and perhaps

76
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,870
more intuitive way.

77
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,409
In the original model, all
outcomes were equally likely.

78
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:37,470
Therefore, in the conditional
model, the five outcomes that

79
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,470
belong to B should also
be equally likely.

80
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,980
Out of those five, there's two
of them that make the event of

81
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,190
interest to occur.

82
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,500
So given that we live in B,
there's two ways out of five

83
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,940
that the event of interest
will materialize.

84
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,159
So the event of interest has

85
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,230
conditional probability [equal to]

86
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,480
2/5.
