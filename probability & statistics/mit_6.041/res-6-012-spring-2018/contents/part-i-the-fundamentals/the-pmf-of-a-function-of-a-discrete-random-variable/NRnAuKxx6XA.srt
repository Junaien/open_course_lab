1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,460
As a warm-up towards finding
the distribution of the

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,860
function of random variables,
let us start by considering

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,200
the discrete case.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:14,160
So let X be a discrete random
variable and let Y be defined

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,190
as a given function of X. We
know the PMF of X and wish to

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,130
find the PMF of Y. Here's
a simple example.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,800
The random variable X takes the
values 2, 3, 4, and 5 with

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,049
the probabilities given in the
figure, and Y is the function

9
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,870
indicated here.

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,000
Then, for example, the
probability that Y takes a

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,780
value of 4.

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,500
This is also the value of the
PMF of Y evaluated at 4.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,610
This is simply the sum of the
probabilities of the possible

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,890
values of X that give
rise to a value of Y

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,870
that is equal to 4.

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,670
Therefore, this expression is
equal to the probability that

17
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,100
X equals to 4 plus the
probability that

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,560
X is equal to 5.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,140
Or, in PMF notation, we can
write it in this manner.

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:26,990
And in this numerical example,
it would be 0.3 plus 0.4.

21
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,890
More generally, for any given
value of little y, the

22
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,520
probability that the random
variable capital Y takes this

23
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,280
particular value is the sum of
the probabilities of the

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,150
little x that result in
that particular value.

25
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,070
So the probability that the
random variable capital Y,

26
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,100
which is the same as g of X,
takes on a specific value is

27
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,060
the sum of the probabilities
of all possible values of

28
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,140
little x where we only consider
those values of

29
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,040
little x that give rise to the
specific value, little y, that

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,080
you're interested.

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,728
Let us now look into the special
case where we have a

32
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:12,420
linear function of a discrete
random variable.

33
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,060
Suppose that X is described by
the PMF shown in this diagram,

34
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,500
and let us consider the random
variable Z, which is defined

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,950
as 2 times X. We would like
to plot the PMF of Z.

36
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,540
First, let us note the values
that Z can take.

37
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,340
When X is equal to minus
1, Z is going to be

38
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,960
equal to minus 2.

39
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,280
When X is equal to 1, Z is
going to be equal to 2.

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,870
And when X is equal to 2, Z
is going to be equal to 4.

41
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,590
This event that X is equal
to minus 1 happens with

42
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,460
probability 2/6, and when that
event happens, Z will take a

43
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,980
value of minus 2.

44
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,590
So this event happens with
probability 2/6.

45
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,560
With probability 1/6, X takes a
value of 1 so that Z takes a

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,320
value of 2.

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,210
And this happens with
probability 1/6.

48
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,830
6 And finally, this last
event here happens

49
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,810
with probability 3/6.

50
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,930
We have thus found the PMF of Z.
Notice that it has the same

51
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,100
shape as the PMF of X, except
that it is stretched or scaled

52
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,300
horizontally by a factor of 2.

53
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,020
Let us now consider the random
variable Y, defined as 2X plus

54
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,640
3, or what is the same
as Z plus 3.

55
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,960
With probability 2/6, Z
is equal to minus 2.

56
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,350
And in that case, Y is going
to be equal to plus 1.

57
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,180
And this event happens
with probability 2/6.

58
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,700
With probability 1/6, Z takes
a value of 2 so that Y it

59
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,510
takes a value of 5.

60
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:04,390
And finally, with probability
3/6, Z takes a value of 4 so

61
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,860
that Y it takes a value of 7.

62
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,990
What we see here is that the PMF
of Y has exactly the same

63
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:22,270
shape as the PMF of Z, except
that it is shifted to the

64
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,530
right by 3.

65
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,390
To summarize, in order to find
the PMF of a linear function

66
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,909
such as 2X plus 3, what we do
is that we first stretch the

67
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:38,070
PMF of X by a factor of
2 and then shift it

68
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,110
horizontally by 3.

69
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,620
We can also describe the PMF
of Y through a formula.

70
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,510
For any given value of little
y, the PMF is going to be

71
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,390
equal to the probability that
our random variable Y takes on

72
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,990
the specific value little y.

73
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,140
Then we recall that Y has been
defined in our example to be

74
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,230
equal to 2X plus 3, so we're
looking at the probability of

75
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,940
this event.

76
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:15,040
But this is the same as the
event that X takes a value

77
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:22,240
equal to y minus
3 divided by 2.

78
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,170
And in PMF notation, we can
write it in this form.

79
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,200
So what this is saying is that
the probability that Y takes

80
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,380
on a specific value is the same
as the probability that X

81
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,180
takes on some other
specific value.

82
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,950
And that value here is that
value of X that would give

83
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,300
rise to this particular
value little y.

84
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,680
Now, we can generalize the
calculation that we just did.

85
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,540
And more generally, if we have
a linear function of a

86
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,220
discrete random variable X, the
PMF of the random variable

87
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,590
Y is given by this formula in
terms of the PMF of the random

88
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,460
variable X. The derivation
is the same.

89
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:16,330
We use b instead the specific
number 3, and we have a

90
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,280
general constant a instead
of the 2 that

91
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,050
we had in this example.

92
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,660
And this formula describes
exactly what we did

93
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,120
graphically in our
previous example.

94
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,720
This factor of a here serves to
stretch the PMF by a factor

95
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:39,690
of a, and this term b here
serves to shift the PMF by b.
