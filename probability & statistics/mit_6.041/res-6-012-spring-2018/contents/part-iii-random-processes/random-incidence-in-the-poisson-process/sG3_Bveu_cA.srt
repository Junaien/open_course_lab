1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,660
In this segment, we discuss the
so-called "random incidence"

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,220
paradox for the Poisson process.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,170
It's a paradox
because it involves

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,200
a somewhat counterintuitive
phenomenon.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,430
However, we will understand
exactly what's going on,

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,450
and in the end, it will
cease to be a paradox

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,700
and we will have an
intuitive understanding

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,650
of what exactly is happening.

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,250
So consider a Poisson process
that has been running forever,

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,500
or think of it as a
Poisson process that

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,100
started a very long
time back in the past.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,110
To make things concrete,
suppose that the arrival rate

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,900
is 4 arrivals per hour so that
the expected interarrival time

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,690
is one fourth, in
hours, or that would

15
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,360
be the same as 15 minutes.

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,690
For example, suppose that
the bus company in your town

17
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,690
claims that buses
arrive to your stop

18
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,200
according to a Poisson process
with this particular rate.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,050
But you don't really believe
that your bus company is

20
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,789
telling the truth and you
decide to investigate.

21
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:15,130
So what you do is the following.

22
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,130
You show up at some
time at your bus stop

23
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,370
and wait until the
next arrival comes

24
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,630
and also ask someone
who lives near the bus

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,770
stop, what time was
the last arrival?

26
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,690
And they tell you
the last arrival

27
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,350
happened at that time instant.

28
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,960
And you measure
this amount of time,

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,120
which is the interarrival
time, record what it is,

30
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,340
repeat this experiment on many
days, and calculate an average.

31
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,880
What you're likely
to see turns out

32
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,320
to be something
around 30 minutes.

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,350
At this point, you could
go to the bus company

34
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,160
and challenge them.

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,100
You claim an arrival rate of
4 arrivals per hour, which

36
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,310
would translate into
interarrivals of 15 minutes,

37
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,070
but every day I go and
check the interarrival time

38
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,800
and I find that they
are close to 30 minutes.

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,030
What's the explanation?

40
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,210
What's going on?

41
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,820
Is it that the belief or
the claim of the bus company

42
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,190
is incorrect, or is there
something more complicated?

43
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,910
So let us try to
understand what's

44
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:33,000
going on by being very
precise and careful.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,360
You show up at the bus
station at some time--

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,530
let's call that time t star.

47
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,110
You ask someone who has
been at the station,

48
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,750
when was the last arrival
time, and they tell you,

49
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,860
and it is some number U.
You wait until the next bus,

50
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,950
and the next bus arrives
at some future time capital

51
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,730
V. You are interested
in the interarrival time

52
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,910
that you're observing,
which is the difference

53
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,290
between these two random
variables V minus U.

54
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,890
Now this difference-- let
us split it into two pieces.

55
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,336
There's one piece
from t star until V,

56
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:20,270
which is V minus t star.

57
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,610
And there's another piece,
which is the first interval,

58
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:31,930
and this is t star minus U. Now
t star, the time at which you

59
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,690
arrive, is just a constant.

60
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,600
Suppose that you arrive at the
bus station at exactly 12 noon.

61
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,430
There's nothing random about it.

62
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,620
However, V and U are
random variables.

63
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,460
What kind of random
variable is this?

64
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:52,290
You show up at 12 noon and you
wait until the first arrival.

65
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,920
Because a Poisson process
starts fresh at any given time--

66
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,680
so after 12 noon it
starts fresh-- this

67
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,940
is the time until the first
arrival in a Poisson process

68
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,150
with rate lambda, so
this is a random variable

69
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,750
which is exponential
with parameter lambda.

70
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,060
Now let us understand what
this random variable is.

71
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,899
One way of thinking
about it is to think

72
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,720
of the Poisson process
running backwards in time,

73
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,420
so you live time backwards.

74
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,910
You show up at 12 noon, and
then time runs backwards,

75
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,600
and you wait until you see
the first arrival coming

76
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,650
in this backwards universe.

77
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,250
So we're dealing
here with the time

78
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,240
until an arrival in
a Poisson process

79
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,840
that runs backwards in time.

80
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,020
What kind of process is a
backwards Poisson process?

81
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,260
If you take a Poisson
process in reverse time,

82
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,590
the independence
assumption is not affected.

83
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,380
Disjoint time intervals
are independent.

84
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,080
Even if you reverse time,
disjoints time intervals

85
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,320
still remain independent.

86
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,130
Any given time interval
of small length delta

87
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,070
will have certain
probabilities of an arrival

88
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,280
or of two arrivals, and
these will be the same

89
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,120
whether time goes forward
or time goes backward.

90
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,400
So the conclusion
from this discussion

91
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,940
is that the backwards
running Poisson process

92
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,020
is also a Poisson
process, and so this time

93
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,500
until the first arrival
in the backwards process

94
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,030
is just like the time until
the first arrival in a Poisson

95
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:38,830
process.

96
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,870
So this also is an
exponential random variable

97
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,510
with parameter lambda.

98
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,050
Even more than that,
these two random variables

99
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,200
are independent of each other.

100
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,180
Why are they independent?

101
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,220
The length of this
time interval has

102
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,830
to do with the history
of the Poisson process

103
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,990
after time t star.

104
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,790
The length of this
time interval has

105
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,200
to do with the history
of the Poisson process

106
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,810
before time t star, but in
the Poisson process because

107
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,800
of the independence property,
the past and the future

108
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,640
are independent, and
therefore, this random variable

109
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,580
is independent from
that random variable.

110
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,120
In any case, the expected value
of the interarrival interval

111
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,300
that you see, the expected
value of this random variable,

112
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,510
is going to be the expected
value of one exponential, which

113
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,240
is 1 over lambda,
plus the expected

114
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,630
value of another exponential,
which is 1 over lambda,

115
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:46,220
and we get a result
of 2 over lambda.

116
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,630
And that's why when you actually
carried out the experiment,

117
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,850
you saw interarrival
intervals that

118
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,390
had a length of 30 minutes
as opposed to the 15 minutes

119
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,890
that you were expecting
in the first place.

120
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,420
Now how can this be?

121
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,280
Since the interarrival
times in a Poisson process

122
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,410
have expected value
1 over lambda,

123
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,160
how can it be that
the expected length

124
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,730
of the interarrival
times that you see

125
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,560
have an expected value
of 2 over lambda?

126
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,360
Well, the resolution of this
paradox has to do [with]

127
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,840
what exactly we mean when we use
the words an interarrival time.

128
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,520
There's one interpretation which
is the first interarrival time,

129
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,060
the second one, the
hundredth interarrival time--

130
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,280
each one of these
actually has an expected

131
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,100
value of 1 over lambda.

132
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,980
But this is a different
kind of interarrival time.

133
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,720
It's not the first
or the second or

134
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,190
some specific k-th
interarrival time.

135
00:07:54,190 --> 00:08:00,570
It's the interarrival time
that you selected to watch.

136
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,780
When you show up at a
certain time, like 12 noon,

137
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,310
you're more likely to fall
inside a large interarrival

138
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,740
interval rather than a
smaller interarrival interval.

139
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,420
So just the fact that
you're showing up

140
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,640
at a certain time
that's uncoordinated

141
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,630
with the rest of
the process makes

142
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,500
you more likely to be
biased towards longer

143
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,740
rather than shorter intervals.

144
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,220
And this bias is what
causes this factor of 2.

145
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,308
So it's an issue really
about how you sample

146
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,250
or how you choose
the interarrival time

147
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,419
that you're going to watch,
and this particular sampling

148
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,990
method has a bias
towards longer intervals.

149
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,420
As we will see, this
is not something

150
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,330
that's specific to
the Poisson process.

151
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,500
In general, in many
occasions there

152
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,760
are different ways of
sampling which give you

153
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,520
different answers, and we will
go through a number of examples

154
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,280
that will give you some
intuition about the source

155
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,660
of the discrepancy
between these two answers.
