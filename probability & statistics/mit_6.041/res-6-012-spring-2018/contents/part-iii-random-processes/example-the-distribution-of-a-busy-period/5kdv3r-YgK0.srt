1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,990
Here is an example of a problem
related to the Bernoulli

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,590
process, which can be
tricky, but is actually

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,010
easy to answer if
one makes good use

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,270
of the fresh-start property.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,910
Here is the setting.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,700
Time is discrete,
divided into slots.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,010
We have a server that
receives tasks to process.

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,070
Tasks received gets processed
in the same time slot.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,640
So slots are divided
into busy ones--

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,290
those are the slots during
which a task gets processed.

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,080
And idle slots--
these are the slots

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,080
during which there is
no task to be processed.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,230
We assume that the
process of job arrivals

14
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,260
is described by a
Bernoulli process

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,070
with some known parameter p.

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,820
So, during each slot
there is probability, p,

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,750
that a job is present,
and different slots

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,010
are independent of each other.

19
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,270
We're interested in the first
busy period of the server.

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,319
The first busy period
starts at the first slot

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,070
during which there
is a job present.

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,990
And the busy period
extends until just

23
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,050
before the next idle slot.

24
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,250
For an example, it
could be the case

25
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,750
that the first slot
is busy, in which case

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,110
the busy period
starts right here.

27
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,340
And the busy periods,
in this example,

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,360
extends for three time units.

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,509
It ends just before
the next idle slot.

30
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:38,910
It could also be the case
that the first slot is idle.

31
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,240
In that case, the
busy period starts

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,940
with the first busy
slot that shows up.

33
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,180
It's this slot in this example.

34
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,229
And extends until just
before the first idle slot

35
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,550
that we observe.

36
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,509
So in this example,
the busy period

37
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,539
extends for four time steps.

38
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:00,860
What is the length of
the first busy period?

39
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,200
Well, the length of
the first busy period

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,320
is a random variable.

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,680
So what we mean by
this question is,

42
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,820
what is the distribution
of this random variable?

43
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,210
Here's how we go about it.

44
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,950
The process starts, we wait
until a first busy slot

45
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,390
appears.

46
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,630
This is a random time, which
is actually the first arrival

47
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,880
time.

48
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,710
And at that time, by
our earlier discussion,

49
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,590
the process will start fresh.

50
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,690
Starting from this next the
slot here and going on forward,

51
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,320
what we have is a
Bernoulli process.

52
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,810
And at each slot, there's
probability p that it is busy,

53
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,610
and probability 1 minus
p that it is idle.

54
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,570
Now, what is this slot here?

55
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,360
This is the first idle slot
in this Bernoulli process

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,990
that starts fresh at
this particular time.

57
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,790
At each time step there
is probability 1 minus p

58
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,120
that the slot is idle.

59
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,440
Think now of idle
slots as successes.

60
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,860
How long does it take
until the first success?

61
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:20,690
We know that this is a geometric
random variable with parameter

62
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,170
equal to the
probability of success.

63
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,079
Since we're thinking of the
idle slot as being a success,

64
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:31,160
the parameter, in this case,
is going to be 1 minus p.

65
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,370
So, the length of
this blue interval

66
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,790
that starts at this
slot and extends

67
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,790
until the first idle slot
has a geometric distribution

68
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,130
with parameter 1 minus p.

69
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,900
But now notice that the
length of this blue interval

70
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,680
is exactly the same as the
length of this red interval.

71
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,460
The red interval is just the
same as the blue interval,

72
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,410
but shifted by 1, but
their lengths are the same.

73
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,460
And the length of
the red interval

74
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,030
is the length of the
first busy period.

75
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,040
So we conclude that the
first busy period is also

76
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,100
a geometric random variable
with parameter 1 minus p.
