1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,270
We now discuss how to come up
with confidence intervals when

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,550
we try to estimate the unknown
mean of some random variable,

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,830
or of some distribution,
using the

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,170
sample mean as our estimator.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,310
So here X1 up to Xn are
independent, identically

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,320
distributed random variables
that are drawn from a

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,320
distribution that has a certain
mean theta, the

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,410
quantity that we want to
estimate, and some variance

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,400
sigma squared.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,570
Let us say that we want
to construct a

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,320
95% confidence interval.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,790
Our starting point will be the
fact that the sample mean,

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,050
according to the central limit
theorem, can be described

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,740
approximately using normal
distributions.

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,420
And we look up at the normal
table, and we observe the

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,450
following--

17
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:55,070
that if we take a standard
normal random variable, then

18
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:02,430
there is probability, 97.5% of
falling below this number,

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,570
1.96, which means that there
is probability 2 1/2% of

20
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,910
falling above that number.

21
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,760
And by symmetry, the probability
of falling below

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,990
minus 1.96 is also 2 1/2%.

23
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,810
This means that this middle
interval here has probability

24
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,070
95%, and we exploit this
fact as follows.

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,860
If we take the sample mean,
subtract the true mean, and

26
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,250
then divide by the standard
deviation of the sample mean,

27
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,479
then we obtain a random
variable, which is

28
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,630
approximately a standard
normal.

29
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,320
Therefore, what we have here
is the probability of an

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,039
approximately standard normal
random variable.

31
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:55,420
Or actually, its absolute value
falling below 1.96.

32
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,710
This is just the event that
our standard normal falls

33
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,180
inside this middle interval
here, according to this entry

34
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,090
from the normal tables and the
previous discussion, this

35
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,179
probability is going to
be approximately 95%.

36
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,470
And now we take this statement,
send this term to

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,710
the other side of the
inequality, and then interpret

38
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,910
what it means for an
absolute value to

39
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,540
be less than something.

40
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,130
And we obtain an equivalent
statement.

41
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,320
This event here is algebraically
identical to the

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,370
event that we have up there, and
this provides us with the

43
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,360
desired confidence interval.

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,920
We think of this quantity here
as the lower end of the

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,320
confidence interval.

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,310
This quantity here is
the upper end of

47
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,010
the confidence interval.

48
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,730
And this statement tells us
that there is probability

49
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,550
approximately equal to 95% that
the confidence interval

50
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,560
constructed this way contains
the true value

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,320
of the unknown parameter.

52
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,650
So this is how we obtain a
95% confidence interval.

53
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,600
If instead we wanted a 90%
confidence interval, we would

54
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,210
proceed in more or less
in the same way.

55
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:20,070
Here, we would want to
have the number 0.95.

56
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,290
Why is that?

57
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,020
We want this middle interval to
have probability 90%, which

58
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,890
means that we want to have
probability 5% at

59
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,525
each one of the tails.

60
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,510
And then we look up at the
normal tables, and we find

61
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,980
that the entry that gives us
probability 95% of being below

62
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,950
that value is 1.645.

63
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:54,910
So if we use 1.645 in place
of 1.96, we obtain a 90%

64
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,310
confidence interval, and
similarly for other choices.

65
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,290
For example, if we want a
99% confidence interval.

66
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,660
There's only one issue that's
left to discuss, and this is

67
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,620
the following.

68
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,860
In order to obtain numerical
values for the endpoints of

69
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,890
the confidence interval, we
need to know sigma, the

70
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,940
standard deviation
of the random

71
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,010
variables that we are observing.

72
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,160
But if we do not know the value
of sigma, then we may

73
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,720
have to do some additional
work.
