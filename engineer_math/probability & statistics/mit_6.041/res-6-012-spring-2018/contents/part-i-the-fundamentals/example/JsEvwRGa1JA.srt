1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,200
Let us now consider
a simple example.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,460
Let random variables X and Y
be described by a joint PMF

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,820
which is the one shown
in this table.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,990
Question--

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,190
are X and Y independent?

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,910
We can try to answer this
question by using the

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,670
definition of independence.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,320
But it is actually more
instructive to proceed in a

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,660
somewhat more intuitive way.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,320
We look at this table, and we
observe that the value of one

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,000
is possible for X. In
particular, the probability

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,950
that X takes the value of one,
this is the marginal

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,690
probability, this can be found
by adding the probabilities of

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,580
all of the outcomes in this
column, which, in this case,

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,710
is 3 over 20.

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,560
Suppose now that somebody tells
you the value of Y. For

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,430
example, I tell you that Y
happens to be equal to one, in

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,100
which case you are transported
into this universe.

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,110
In this universe, the
conditional probability that X

20
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,510
takes a value of one, given that
Y takes a value of one,

21
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,100
what is it?

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,800
In this universe, there's
zero probability

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,070
associated to this outcome.

24
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,660
So this probability
is zero, which is

25
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,010
different than 3 over 20.

26
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,789
And since these two numbers are
different, this means that

27
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:31,720
information from Y changes our
beliefs about what's going to

28
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,600
happen to X. And so, we do
not have independence.

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,009
So again, intuitively, in the
beginning, we thought that X

30
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:42,380
equal to one was possible.

31
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,360
But information given by Y,
namely that Y is equal to one,

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,360
tells us that, actually, X
equals to one is impossible.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,700
Information about Y changed our
beliefs about X, so X and

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,990
Y are dependent.

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,510
Now, when we first introduced
the notion of independence

36
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,310
some time ago, we also
introduced the notion of

37
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,620
conditional independence.

38
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,500
And we said that conditional
independence is the same as

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,940
ordinary independence, except
that it would be applied to a

40
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,880
conditional universe.

41
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,480
Something similar can be done
for the case of random

42
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,960
variables as well.

43
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,030
So suppose, for example, that
someone tells us that the

44
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,680
outcome of the experiment
was such that it belongs

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,250
to this blue set.

46
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,960
This is the set where X is less
than or equal to 2, and Y

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,250
is larger than or
equal to three.

48
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,420
So we're given this information,
and this is now

49
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,050
our new conditional model.

50
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,600
The question is, within this
new conditional model are

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,079
random variables X and
Y independent?

52
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,440
Let's just right down the
conditional model, where I'm

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,610
only showing the four possible
outcomes that are allowed in

54
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,850
the conditional model.

55
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,810
All the others, of course, will
have zero probability in

56
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,540
the conditional model.

57
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,110
So in the conditional model,
probabilities will keep the

58
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,260
same proportions as in the
unconditional model--

59
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,260
and the proportions
are 1, 2, 2, 4--

60
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,990
but then they need to be scaled,
or normalized, so that

61
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,810
they add to 1.

62
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,030
And to make them add to 1, we
need to divide them all by 9.

63
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,520
In this conditional model, this
is the joint PMF of the

64
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,400
two random variables X and Y.
Let us find the marginal PMFs.

65
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,020
To find the marginal PMF
of X, we add the

66
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,300
entries in this column.

67
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,829
And we get here 1/3,
and here 2/3.

68
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:50,829
And to find the marginal
PMF of y, we add the

69
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,110
entries in this [row]

70
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,090
to find 2/3.

71
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,940
And we adds the entries
in that [row]

72
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,020
to find 1/3.

73
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,000
So this is the marginal
PMF of x.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,900
That's the marginal PMF of Y.
And now we notice that this

75
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,670
entry of the joint PMF
is 1/3 times 1/3, the

76
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,300
product of the marginals.

77
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,560
This entry is the product of 1/3
times 2/3, the product of

78
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,070
the marginals, and so on for
the remaining entries.

79
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,670
So each entry of the joint PMF
is equal to the product of the

80
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,680
corresponding entries of
the marginal PMFs.

81
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,670
And this is the definition
of independence.

82
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,670
So in this conditional blue
universe, we do have

83
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,210
independence.

84
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,909
And the way that this was
established was to check that

85
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:42,940
the joint PMF factors as a
product of marginal PMFs.
