1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,960
We will now go through an
example that brings together

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,300
all of the concepts that
we have introduced.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,480
We have a stick of length l.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,910
And we break that stick at some
random location, which

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,860
corresponds to a random
variable, X.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,060
And we assume that this random
variable is uniform over the

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,790
length of the stick.

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,350
So its PDF has this
particular shape.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,770
And for the PDF to integrate to
1, the height of this PDF

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,660
must be equal to 1 over l.

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,660
Then we take the piece of the
stick that we are left with,

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,380
which has length X, and we break
it at a random location,

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,050
which we call Y. And we assume
that this location Y is

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,830
uniformly distributed over the
length of the stick that we

15
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,540
were left with.

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,500
What does this assumption
mean?

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,350
It means that if the first break
was at some particular

18
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:08,370
value, x, then the random
variable Y has a conditional

19
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:14,350
distribution, which is uniform
over the interval from 0 to x.

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,490
So the conditional
PDF is uniform.

21
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,350
A conditional PDF, like
any other PDF, must

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,560
integrate to 1.

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,430
So the height of this
conditional PDF is

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,930
equal to 1 over x.

25
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,020
Are X and Y independent?

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,920
No.

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,780
One way to see it is that if
you change little x, the

28
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,110
conditional PDF of Y would have
been something different.

29
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,690
Whereas if we have independence,
all the

30
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,860
conditional PDFs have to be the
same when you change the

31
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,720
value of little x.

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,810
Another way to see it is that
if I tell you that x is 0.5,

33
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,310
this gives you lots of
information about Y. It tells

34
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,570
you that Y has to be less
than or equal to 0.5.

35
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,540
So the value of the random
variable X gives you plenty of

36
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,050
information about the other
random variable.

37
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,950
And so we do not have
independence.

38
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,199
Notice that in this example,
instead of starting with a

39
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,300
full description of the random
variables in terms of a joint

40
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,430
PDF, we use a marginal PDF and
then a conditional PDF to

41
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,420
construct our model.

42
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,390
Of course, with these two pieces
of information, we can

43
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,500
reconstruct the joint PDF using
the multiplication rule.

44
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,400
The marginal is 1 over l.

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,220
The conditional is 1 over x.

46
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,350
So the joint is equal
to 1 over lx.

47
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,620
But for which values of x and
y is this the correct

48
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,860
expression?

49
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,640
It is correct only for those
values that are possible.

50
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:54,920
So 0 has to be less than y,
less than x, less than l.

51
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,079
This is the range of values
that are possible in this

52
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,680
particular experiment.

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,670
And we can visualize
those values.

54
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,540
They are those that correspond
to this shaded triangle here.

55
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,610
x and y are less than
or equal to l.

56
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,050
And y has to be less
than or equal to x.

57
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,760
If you try to visualize the
joint PDF, notice that since

58
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,310
it only depends on x not on y,
if you fix a value of x and

59
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,600
you look at the slice of the
joint PDF, the value of the

60
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,550
joint PDF is going to be a
constant on that slice.

61
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,280
On this slice, it's going to be
another constant, actually

62
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,270
a bigger one.

63
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,870
On that slice, an even
bigger constant.

64
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,030
And actually, this constant is
bigger and bigger and goes to

65
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,980
infinity as we approach 0.

66
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,640
Of course, the fact that the
slice is constant is just a

67
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,320
reflection of the fact that
the conditional PDF is

68
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,550
constant over the range of
values that the random

69
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,115
variable can take.

70
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:03,360
Let us now continue with
some calculations.

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,120
Let us find the marginal PDF
of Y. How do we do it?

72
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,310
Since we have in our hands the
joint PDF, we can find the

73
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,450
marginal by integrating
the joint.

74
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:25,280
And in our case, the joint
is equal to 1 over lx.

75
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,350
And we integrate over all x's.

76
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,110
Now, what is the range
of the integration?

77
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:37,970
If we fix a certain value of y,
the joint PDF is actually 0

78
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,290
in this region and
in that region.

79
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,700
So we should only integrate over
x's that correspond to

80
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,240
this interval.

81
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,330
What is that interval?

82
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,430
It's the interval
that ends at l.

83
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,570
And because this is a line
of slope 1, this value

84
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,280
here is also y.

85
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,240
So we integrate over
an interval where x

86
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,010
ranges from y to l.

87
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,350
In fact, this is just the range
of x's that are possible

88
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,340
for a given value of y.

89
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,400
x must always be larger
than or equal to y.

90
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,290
Now, the integral of 1 over
x is a logarithm.

91
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,260
And using this fact, we can
evaluate this integral.

92
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:28,870
And it's 1 over l times the
logarithm of l over y.

93
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,170
For what y's is this a
correct expression?

94
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,970
Well, it makes sense only for
those y's that are possible in

95
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,650
this experiment.

96
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:44,564
And that's the range
from 0 to l.

97
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:48,180
When y is equal to l, we have
the logarithm of 1, which is

98
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,120
equal to 0.

99
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,870
So the value of the
PDF is 0 here.

100
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,480
As y decreases, this ratio

101
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,370
increases and goes to infinity.

102
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,830
So the log of that also
blows up to infinity.

103
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,100
And we get a shape of this form,
where the function that

104
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,270
we're dealing with goes to
infinity as we approach 0.

105
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,530
Is this a problem having a PDF
that blows up to infinity?

106
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,460
Not really.

107
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,480
As long as the area under this
PDF is equal to 1, it's still

108
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,280
a legitimate PDF.

109
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,670
And blowing up to infinity
is not an issue.

110
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,530
Let us now calculate the
expected value of Y. One way

111
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,780
of doing this is by using the
definition of the expectation.

112
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,570
It's the integral of y times the
density of y, which is 1

113
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,750
over l times the log
of l over y.

114
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,320
And the range of integration
has to be those values for

115
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,740
which we have a non-zero
density.

116
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,170
So we integrate from 0 to l,
which are the possible values

117
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,320
of the random variable Y.
This is an integral

118
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,330
that's pretty messy.

119
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,050
One can actually integrate it
using integration by parts.

120
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,300
But the calculation
is a bit tedious.

121
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,490
So let us look for
an alternative

122
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,100
and more clever approach.

123
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,720
The idea is to divide
and conquer.

124
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,900
We're going to use the total
expectation theorem, where

125
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,810
we're going to condition on X.
The total expectation theorem

126
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,510
tells us that the expected value
of Y is the integral

127
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,250
over all possible values of the
random variable X, which

128
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,220
is from 0 to l.

129
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:41,350
The density of X, which is 1
over l, times the conditional

130
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:47,190
expectation of Y given that X
is equal to some little x.

131
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,940
And we integrate over all x's.

132
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,480
Why is this simpler?

133
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,230
When we condition on X taking
a specific value, Y has a

134
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,620
uniform distribution
between 0 and x.

135
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,430
And therefore, this conditional
expectation is the

136
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,130
expectation of a uniform,
which is 1/2 the

137
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,010
range of that uniform.

138
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,240
So we obtain the integral
from 0 to l.

139
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,470
1 over l times x over 2, dx.

140
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,760
And finally, that's an
integral that we

141
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,310
can evaluate easily.

142
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,700
Or we can think even
in a simpler way.

143
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,095
This expression here is
the density of x.

144
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,520
This is x itself.

145
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,820
So the integral of this times x
gives us the expected value

146
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,860
of X. And there's only
a factor of 1/2

147
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,160
that's left out there.

148
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,920
So we obtain 1/2 the expected
value of X. But now, X itself

149
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,020
is uniform on an interval
that has length l.

150
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,030
And therefore, the expected
value of x is l over 2.

151
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,890
And so we get the final answer,
which is 1/2 times l

152
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,280
over 2, which is l over four.

153
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,630
This answer makes
intuitive sense.

154
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,040
If we break a stick once, the
expected value or what we're

155
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,160
left with is half of what
we started with.

156
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,330
But if we break it once more,
then we expect it on the

157
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,750
average to be cut by a
factor again of 1/2.

158
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,300
And so we expect to be left with
a stick that has length

159
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,890
1/4 of what we started with.

160
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,280
So this example is a
particularly nice one, because

161
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,740
we used all of the concepts
that we have introduced--

162
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,510
marginal PDFs, joint PDFs,
conditional PDFs, and the

163
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,780
relations between them, as
well as expectations,

164
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,720
calculations of expectations,
and conditional expectations,

165
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,760
as well as the total probability
theorem.
