1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,620
We now look at an example
similar to the previous one,

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,750
in which we have again two
scenarios, but in which we

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,160
have both discrete
and continuous

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,600
random variables involved.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,620
You have $1 and the opportunity

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,200
to play in the lottery.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,730
With probability 1/2, you do
nothing and you're left with

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,426
the dollar that you
started with.

9
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:28,330
With probability 1/2, you decide
to play the lottery.

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,780
And in that case, you get back
an amount of money which is

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,120
random and uniformly
distributed

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,100
between zero and two.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,170
Is the random variable,
X, discrete?

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,120
The answer is no, because
it takes values on

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,830
a continuous range.

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,670
Is the random variable,
X, continuous?

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,790
The answer is no, because the
probability that X takes the

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,920
value of exactly one
is equal to 1/2.

19
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,900
Even though X takes values in
a continuous range, this is

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,530
not enough to make it a
continuous random variable.

21
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,460
We defined continuous random
variables to be those that can

22
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,460
be described by a PDF.

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,930
And you have seen it in such a
case, any individual point

24
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,880
should have zero probability.

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,060
But this is not the case here,
and so X is not continuous.

26
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,840
We call X a mixed
random variable.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,770
More generally, we can have a
situation where the random

28
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,300
variable X with some probability
is the same as a

29
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,320
particular discrete random
variable, and with some other

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,140
probability it is equal
to some other

31
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,420
continuous random variable.

32
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,550
Such a random variable, X, does
not have a PMF because it

33
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,240
is not discrete.

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,880
Also, it does not have a PDF
because it is not continuous.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,479
How do we describe such
a random variable?

36
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,450
Well, we can describe it in
terms of a cumulative

37
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,070
distribution function.

38
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,760
CDFs are always well
defined for all

39
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,000
kinds of random variables.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,290
We have two scenarios, and
so we can use the Total

41
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,890
Probability Theorem and write
that the CDF is equal to the

42
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,600
probability of the first
scenario, which is p, times

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,240
the probability that the random
variable Y is less than

44
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,820
or equal to x.

45
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,900
This is a conditional model
under the first scenario.

46
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,870
And with some probability, we
have the second scenario.

47
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,370
And under that scenario, X will
take a value less than

48
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,800
little x, if and only if our
random variable Z will take a

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,280
value less than little x.

50
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,510
Or in CDF notation, this is p
times the CDF of the random

51
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,620
variable Y evaluated at this
particular x plus another

52
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:07,520
weighted term involving the CDF
of the random variable Z.

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,820
We can also define the expected
value of X in a way

54
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,940
that is consistent with the
Total Expectation Theorem,

55
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,290
namely define the expected
value of X to be the

56
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,850
probability of the first
scenario, in which case X is

57
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,870
discrete times the expected
value of the associated

58
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,120
discrete random variable, plus
the probability of the second

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,740
scenario, under which X is
continuous, times the expected

60
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,200
value of the associated
continuous random variable.

61
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,670
Going back to our original
example, we have two

62
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:49,242
scenarios, the scenarios that
we can call A1 and A2.

63
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:54,110
Under the first scenario, we
have a uniform PDF, and the

64
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,010
corresponding CDF
is as follows.

65
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,880
It's flat until zero, then
it rises linearly.

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,880
And then it stays flat,
and the value

67
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,900
here is equal to one.

68
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,750
So the slope here is 1/2.

69
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,050
So the slope is equal to
the corresponding PDF.

70
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,029
Under the second scenario, we
have a discrete, actually a

71
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,529
constant random variable.

72
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:25,020
And so the CDF is flat at zero
until this value, and at that

73
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,800
value we have a jump
equal to one.

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,690
We then use the Total
Probability Theorem, which

75
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,700
tells us that the CDF of the
mixed random variable will be

76
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,450
1/2 times the CDF under the
first scenario plus 1/2 times

77
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,850
the CDF under the
second scenario.

78
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,590
So we take 1/2 of this plot
and 1/2 of that plot

79
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,990
and add them up.

80
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:56,905
What we get is a function that
rises now at the slope of 1/4.

81
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,970
Then we have a jump, and the
size of that to jump is going

82
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,970
to be equal to 1/2.

83
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:16,770
And then it continues at a slope
of 1/4 until it reaches

84
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,470
this value.

85
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,915
And after that time,
it remains flat.

86
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,090
So this is a simple illustration
that for mixed

87
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,720
random variables it's not
too hard to obtain the

88
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,590
corresponding CDF even though
this random variable does not

89
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,370
have a PDF or a PMF of its own.
