1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,780
We will now discuss De Morgan's
laws that are some

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,109
very useful relations between
sets and their complements.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,500
One of the De Morgan's
laws takes this form.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,360
If we take the intersection of
two sets and then take the

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,500
complement of this intersection,
what we obtain

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,070
is the union of the complements
of the two sets.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,840
Pictorially, here is
the situation.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,680
We have our universal set.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:34,210
Inside that set, we have a set,
S, which is this one.

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:40,340
And we have another set,
T, which is this one.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,840
Let us look at this side.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,950
The complement of S is this
part of the diagram.

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,950
The complement of T is this
part of the diagram.

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,450
What is left?

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,680
What is left is just this region
here, which is the

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,740
intersection of S with T. So
anything that does not belong

17
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,010
here belongs to the
intersection.

18
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,950
This means that the complement
of the intersection is

19
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,570
everything out there,
which is the set.

20
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,180
If you're not convinced by this
pictorial proof, let us

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,470
go through an argument that
is a little more formal.

22
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,360
What does it take for
an element to belong

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,870
to the first set?

24
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,729
In order to belong to that
set, x belongs to the

25
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,539
complement of S intersection T.
This is the same as saying

26
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:42,020
that x does not belong to
the intersection [of]

27
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,450
S with T.

28
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,370
What does that mean?

29
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,500
Since it is not in the
intersection, this is the same

30
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,940
as saying that x does not belong
to S or x does not

31
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:04,640
belong to T. But this is the
same as saying that x belongs

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,580
to the complement of S or x
belongs to the complement of

33
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:17,650
T. And this is equivalent to
saying that x belongs to the

34
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:23,310
union of the complement of S
with the complement of T.

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,610
So this establishes this
first De Morgan's law.

36
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,350
There's another De Morgan's law,
which is obtained from

37
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,110
this one by a syntactic
substitution.

38
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,450
We're going to play the
following trick.

39
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,520
Wherever we see an S, we're
going to replace it by S

40
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,410
complement.

41
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,290
And wherever we see an S
complement, we will replace it

42
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,620
with an S.

43
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,440
And similarly, whenever we see
a T, we'll replace it by T

44
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,150
complement.

45
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,470
And when we see a T complement,
we will replace it

46
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,770
by T. So doing this syntactic
substitution, what we obtain

47
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,100
is S complement intersection
with T complement--

48
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,280
everything gets complemented--

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,200
is the same as S union T.

50
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,560
Now, let us take complements
of both sides.

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,760
The complement of a complement
is the set itself.

52
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,690
So we obtain this.

53
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,880
And now, we take the complement
of the other side,

54
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,970
which is this one.

55
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,640
And this is the second
De Morgan's law.

56
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,930
It tells us that the complement
of a union is the

57
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,270
same as the intersection
of the complements.

58
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:43,010
We derived it from the first De
Morgan's law by a syntactic

59
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,980
substitution.

60
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,630
If you're not convinced, it
would be useful for you to go

61
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,040
through an argument of this kind
to show that something is

62
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,400
an element of this set if and
only if it is an element of

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,870
that set as well.

64
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,000
Finally, it turns out that De
Morgan's laws are valid when

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,530
we take unions or
intersections of

66
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,480
more than two sets.

67
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,390
There is a more general form.

68
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,390
And the general form
is as follows--

69
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,370
an analogy with this one.

70
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,089
If we have a collection of sets,
Sn, perhaps an infinite

71
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,160
collection, we take the
intersection of those sets and

72
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,580
then the complement, what that
is is the union of the

73
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,350
complements.

74
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,540
So this is analygous
to this law.

75
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,840
And this law extends to this
one: if we have the union of

76
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,455
certain sets and we take the
complement of the union, what

77
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:41,220
we obtain is the intersection
of the complements.

78
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,409
We will have many occasions
to use De Morgan's laws.

79
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,370
They're actually very useful.

80
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,230
They allow us, in general, to
go back and forth between

81
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,560
unions and intersections.
