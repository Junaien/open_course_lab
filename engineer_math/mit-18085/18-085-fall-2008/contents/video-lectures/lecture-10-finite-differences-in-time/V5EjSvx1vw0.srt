PROFESSOR STRANG: You
can pick up the homeworks

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,470
after if you didn't get one.

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,350
And the good grade is five.

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,900
And the MATLABs are coming
in, that's all good.

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:40,050
And I'll have some thoughts
about the MATLAB Monday.

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,490
I wanted to say a little
more about finite differences

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,310
in time just because
they're so important.

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:53,080
And I got the idea of a forward
Euler and a backward Euler

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,160
but I want to give you a
couple of more possibilities

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,660
just so you see how finite
difference methods are created.

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,470
And then I want to
get started on least

20
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,610
squares, the next major
topic, the next case

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,480
where A transpose A shows up
at the core of everything.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,040
So what we did with
finite differences

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,000
was this was our model
problem for one spring

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,030
and this is our model
problem for n springs

25
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,990
with n different masses.

26
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,090
So this is like, scalar. u
is just a single unknown.

27
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,530
Here u is a vector unknown.

28
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,390
If I reduce things to like,
even this model problem,

29
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,450
if I introduce the velocity,
because everybody's also

30
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,850
interested in
computing velocity,

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,000
then the velocity is
u' and the equation

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,730
tells me that v' is minus u.

33
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,620
So I have a system.

34
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,780
Better to think in terms
of first order systems

35
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,550
because they include everything.

36
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,590
So the first order
system there, do

37
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,580
you see what the matrix is
on that right-hand side?

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,350
I'm always seeing a matrix
that's multiplying [u, v].

39
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:17,360
So this would be our example
of this general set-up.

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,330
This general set-up.

41
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,680
First order systems, taking
them to be linear here.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,670
And then I better
say a little bit

43
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:34,110
about what happens when they're
not linear today and later.

44
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,140
So this is my problem. du/dt=Au.

45
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,720


46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,930
And the exact solution would
come from the eigenvalues

47
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:50,260
and eigenvectors of A. We would
have the e^(lambda*t)'s, giving

48
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,360
us the time growth or
decay or oscillation,

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,960
times their eigenvectors.

50
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,690
And a combination of those
would be the exact answer.

51
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,620
So that's the general
method for using

52
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:13,190
eigenvalues and eigenvectors
to get exact solutions.

53
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,620
I'm not speaking now
about exact solutions.

54
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,880
I'm going to talk about
finite differences in time

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,630
because for more
general problems

56
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,550
I must expect to go
to finite differences.

57
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,870
I can't expect exact solutions
like pure cos(t) or sin(t).

58
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,330
So here's my problem,
model problem.

59
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,980
Here is Euler's first idea.

60
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,230
So idea one from Euler
was replace the derivative

61
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,860
by a finite difference taking
time steps forward in time

62
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,610
and use the equation
to tell you the slope

63
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,880
at the start of the step.

64
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,680
Do you see Euler's
equation there?

65
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,510
And that is definitely a
reasonable thing to start with.

66
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,150
It's not very accurate.

67
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,090
It's not perfectly stable.

68
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,200
It doesn't preserve energy.

69
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,160
We saw the answer spiraling
out but if you only

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,610
want to compute up
to a limited time

71
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,760
you could use it with a
pretty small time step.

72
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,190
But you can do better.

73
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,950
Now backward Euler
was the other way.

74
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,150
So it's just the contrast of
the two that you want to see.

75
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,880
Neither one is an
outstanding method.

76
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,170
They're both only
first order accurate.

77
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:54,010
So backward Euler,
this time step in time

78
00:04:54,010 --> 00:05:00,470
is still the difference that
replaces the derivative.

79
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,130
But now everybody notices
the big difference.

80
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,110
The slope is being computed
at the end of the time step.

81
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,520
And that's more stable.

82
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,480
That's the one that spiraled in.

83
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,580
And I would call
this method explicit.

84
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,620
What does explicit mean?

85
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,960
It means that I can
find u_(n+1) directly.

86
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,170
This method I would
call implicit.

87
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,610
And what does implicit mean?

88
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,020
Implicit means that u_(n+1)
is appearing on the right-hand

89
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,660
side as well as the left so I've
got to move it over and I have

90
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,720
to solve a system of equations
to find the next u_(n+1).

91
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,890
So you see that basic
separation of ideas here.

92
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,000
Forward, faster,
but less stable.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,370
Backward, slower,
generally more stable

94
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,640
and in fact, in this
case somehow too stable.

95
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,100
It dissipates more energy.

96
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,710
You don't want to
lose all your energy.

97
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,590
So you look for
something better.

98
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,850
And also you look for
something more accurate.

99
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,010
I want to suggest a
more accurate method,

100
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,130
the trapezoidal method.

101
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,250
Which just follows
that basic principle

102
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,310
that if I center
things at halfway

103
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,300
I'm probably going to pick
up an order of accuracy.

104
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:40,850
So centering it halfway I took
half of backward Euler and half

105
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,870
of forward Euler.

106
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:47,010
So is this one
explicit or implicit?

107
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,690
Implicit.

108
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,850
Implicit. u_(n+1) is
still appearing here,

109
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,470
has to move over there.

110
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,420
So if I move it over I
could say here I have,

111
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,251
let me multiply up by delta
t and bring the u_(n+1) over

112
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:01,750
here.

113
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,370
So I'd have u_(n+1).

114
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:10,950
I'll have minus
delta t over two A.

115
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,240
All that's what's
multiplying u_(n+1).

116
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,250
Right?

117
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,500
When I multiply
up, let me do that.

118
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,540
Let me make it
easy for your eyes.

119
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,380
I'll multiply up by the delta t.

120
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,980
And then I'm bringing this
part, the implicit part.

121
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,210
So that's my left-hand side.

122
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,720
And what's my
right-hand side? u_n

123
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:38,240
is going over as the identity
plus delta t over two A.

124
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,570
All that's what's
multiplying u_n.

125
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,040
Good.

126
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,200
So this is the matrix that has
to get inverted at every step.

127
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,340
Of course, in this model problem
that's not expensive to do.

128
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,990
If we have the same
matrix at every step,

129
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,280
if we have a linear
time-invariant system,

130
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,690
well we can just invert it once
or factor it in into L times U

131
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,760
once.

132
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,400
We don't have to do
it at every step.

133
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,950
So that's, of course, very fast.

134
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,300
But when the problem
becomes non-linear

135
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,480
we're going to start
paying a price for a more

136
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,300
complicated implicit part.

137
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,010
What I'm interested
in right now just

138
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:33,140
to sort of see
these differences,

139
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:39,610
there's a particular matrix
A that is my model here.

140
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,570
It's antisymmetric.

141
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,710
Notice it's antisymmetric
and that sort of

142
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,750
goes with conserving energy.

143
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,820
I'm not going to-- In
a first order system,

144
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,800
that antisymmetric tells me that
the eigenvalues of that matrix

145
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,710
are pure imaginary.

146
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,110
And so I'm going to get e^(it).

147
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm going to get things
that don't blow up,

148
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,450
that don't decay.

149
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:14,600
So I want to see, what's
the growth factor?

150
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,080
Suppose you want to understand,
is this method good,

151
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,830
what's its growth factor?

152
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,900
So that will tell
me about stability.

153
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,030
It'll tell me about
accuracy, too.

154
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:34,090
So its growth factor,
all I want to do

155
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:42,800
is put everything on the
right side of the equation.

156
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,280
I want to write it in this form.

157
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,930
So that G will be
the growth matrix.

158
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,310
And what is G?

159
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,270
Well, I just have
to invert that.

160
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,900
That's I minus delta t over
two A. The inverse of that, so

161
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:08,100
that's the implicit part,
times the explicit part.

162
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,180
I'm not doing anything
difficult here.

163
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:16,520
Just seeing how
would you approach

164
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,830
to understand whether
the solution to this

165
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:28,120
is growing, decaying,
or staying as we hope,

166
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,490
with maybe constant energy.

167
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,974
Because that's what the
true solution is doing.

168
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:35,640
The true solution,
you remember, is just

169
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,920
going around in a circle
in our model problem

170
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:45,050
and just oscillating
forever in our model system.

171
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,830
What about the growth
or decay or whatever

172
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,030
of that growth factor?

173
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,250
Well again, this
is the point where

174
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,820
I would look for eigenvalues.

175
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,210
If I have a matrix G, and
everybody recognizes that

176
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:07,740
after n time steps, what
matrix am I going to have?

177
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,220
What matrix connects
u_n to the original u_0?

178
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,510
That matrix is?

179
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,310
G^n.

180
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,550
At every step I'm
multiplying by a G.

181
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,160
So with finite differences,
you have powers.

182
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,430
That's the rule.

183
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,640
With differential equations,
you have exponentials.

184
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,220
With finite differences, finite
steps, you have powers of G.

185
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:42,220
So I'm interested in G^n and
what tells me about that is

186
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,730
the eigenvalues here.

187
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,190
If I had to ask for the
eigenvalues of this matrix,

188
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:56,010
they would be the eigenvalues
of G. So eig(G), can I say,

189
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,980
for this case.

190
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,700
Actually, can I just
say what it would be?

191
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,390
What are the
eigenvalues of this guy?

192
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,330
The eigenvalues of that
factor are one plus delta t

193
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,260
over two times the
eigenvalues of A. That's

194
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,080
what we're getting from here.

195
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,700
And here, this is the inverse.

196
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,240
So its eigenvalues will
come in the denominator.

197
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,230
This'll be one minus delta t
over two times the eigenvalues

198
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,920
of A. That's pretty good.

199
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,830
That's pretty good.

200
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,680
Actually this sort
of shows me a lot.

201
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,000
Well, in the case of
this model example,

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,220
the eigenvalues
were i and minus i.

203
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:57,170
This is for the special
case A equals [0, 1; -1, 0].

204
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:04,100
This will be one plus i delta
t over two divided by one

205
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,000
minus i delta t over two.

206
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,560
And the complex conjugate
for the other eigenvalue.

207
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,000
It'd be two eigenvalues.

208
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,550
Let me work with the one,
let me take the one that's i

209
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,510
and then there would be a
similar deal with minus i.

210
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:32,190
That's our eigenvalue of G.
Where in the complex plane

211
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,320
is that number?

212
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,780
If I give you that
complex number.

213
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,190
We're meeting
complex numbers here.

214
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,140
We're not meeting
complex functions,

215
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,650
just we have to be able to
deal with complex numbers.

216
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,570
Actually, when I look
at those two numbers,

217
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,440
what do I see right
away about them?

218
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,140
How are they related?

219
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,210
They're conjugates, right?

220
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,640
Conjugates of each other.

221
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,650
This one is in
the complex plane,

222
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,360
I would go along one, the real
axis, and up delta t over two.

223
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,780
And this one I would go
down delta t over two.

224
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:21,610
And that symmetry is what
I, the word you used,

225
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,500
the complex conjugate.

226
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,830
Compare that length for the top
with that length for the bottom

227
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,750
and what do you get?

228
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,940
Same length.

229
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,000
So I'm concluding
that in this case

230
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,470
the magnitude of these
eigenvalues of G is what?

231
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,570
So magnitude, absolute
value, is just

232
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,270
the absolute value
of that divided

233
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,670
by the absolute value of that.

234
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,800
It's this distance
divided by this distance.

235
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,450
And you told me already
the answer is one.

236
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:06,720
The eigenvalues are
right on the unit circle.

237
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,470
In some ways that's wonderful.

238
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,490
The solution if
you compute exactly

239
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,120
will stay on the unit circle.

240
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,490
Of course, it will not
be exactly the same

241
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,710
as the continuous solution.

242
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,461
But the energy won't change.

243
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:32,710
We're not going to spiral out.

244
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,030
We're not going to spiral in.

245
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,020
It's this average and
it's more accurate.

246
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,460
So trapezoidal method
is like, the workhorse

247
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,120
for finite element codes.

248
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:52,330
Trapezoidal method is a
pretty successful method.

249
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,610
What's the price?

250
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,200
The price is this implicit
stuff that you have to solve.

251
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,990
So I should say
it's the workhorse

252
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,300
among implicit methods.

253
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,660
And it's simple.

254
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,630
So just to have a picture,
finite element codes

255
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,200
usually are not shooting
for great accuracy.

256
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,780
Many finite element
calculations,

257
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,610
you're happy with two
or three decimal places.

258
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,590
So we're not shooting
for great accuracy.

259
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,670
Second order is very adequate.

260
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:33,910
What we don't want, of
course, is to be unstable.

261
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:39,700
We don't want to
lose all the energy.

262
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:49,240
So this is really a good method.

263
00:16:49,240 --> 00:17:02,310
I have to say it's a good
method, but not perfect.

264
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:08,320
For linear problems, for my
model problem this is fine.

265
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,860
For a real problem,
a difficult problem

266
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:25,770
in mechanics you might find that
the energy, you might find it

267
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,870
goes a little unstable
and non-linearity

268
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,960
tends to grab onto a little
instability and make it worse.

269
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,540
So like Professor Bathe,
if you take his course

270
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:46,820
on finite elements, this
trapezoidal rule-- Many people

271
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,090
have reinvented it.

272
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,940
There's a Newmark
family of methods

273
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,890
and with special parameter, you
get back this one and everybody

274
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,000
makes that choice practically.

275
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,050
There's just a host of
finite difference methods.

276
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,450
I'm wondering whether you
want me to tell you one more.

277
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,130
Do you want one more
finite difference method?

278
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,540
Just to like, see what.

279
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,210
You said yes, right?

280
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,130
One more method.

281
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:21,120
One more and then, this
is a subject on its own.

282
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,500
But just to see what
else could you do.

283
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,180
What else might you do?

284
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,020
And let me say why you would.

285
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,990
And Professor
Bathe had to do it.

286
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:37,250
In some problems he found
that with non-linear problems,

287
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,980
he found that this method, which
for a perfect linear problem

288
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,420
stays exactly one, that's great,
but you're playing with fire.

289
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:54,520
To be right on the unit circle,
if non-linearity pushes you off

290
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,850
then you wish you had not tried
tried for that perfection.

291
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:10,040
So let me describe a
backward difference.

292
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:18,090
Let me write down,
I'll call this BDF2.

293
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,650
All these formulas
have names and numbers.

294
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,230
So this would be Backward
Difference Formula second order

295
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,810
accurate.

296
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,360
You'll see, it goes
two steps back.

297
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:38,240
So here it is.
u_(n+1)-u_n over delta t.

298
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,520
And then there's
another term which

299
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,330
gets the second order accuracy.

300
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:54,220
It happens to be u_(n+1) -
2u_n + u_(n-1) over delta t.

301
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,310
And then that really is delta t.

302
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,260
Equals Au_(n+1).

303
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,360


304
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,700
It's good practice.

305
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:11,010
That formula came
from somewhere.

306
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,110
What if we look at it.

307
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,950
What do we see?

308
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,990
What's the picture for
a formula like that?

309
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:25,180
Is it implicit or explicit
first, our first question.

310
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,950
Implicit.

311
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,870
Because it's using, this
right-hand side involves this.

312
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,190
And if it was a
non-linear equation,

313
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,560
whatever that right-hand
side is, not linear,

314
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,330
would be evaluated
at the new step

315
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:43,200
and therefore would have
to go back over here.

316
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,640
It is second order
accurate and I won't go

317
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,080
through the checking on that.

318
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,970
And is it stable?

319
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,120
That's another question.

320
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,620
We have to find
eigenvalues here.

321
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:07,860
Let me not go through
all details there.

322
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,920
It is stable.

323
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,460
And it's slightly dissipative.

324
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,110
It's not as dissipative
as backward Euler.

325
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,130
There you're losing energy fast.

326
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:24,750
Here the eigenvalues,
the thing would

327
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:33,390
stay much closer to the unit
circle than backward Euler.

328
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:41,350
I'll just put up
there so that you see.

329
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,590
What are other features
that you see right away

330
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,220
from this method?

331
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,050
The fact that it involves
not only u_(n+1) and u_n,

332
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,050
but also u_(n-1).

333
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,320
What does that mean?

334
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,870
How do I get started
with that method?

335
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,110
Right?

336
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,910
This calls to find the new u.

337
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:07,630
I need the previous one
and the one before that.

338
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,270
No problem, I have them.

339
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,160
Except at the start I don't.

340
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,520
So it'll need a sort
of special start

341
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,840
to be able to figure
out what should u_n be.

342
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,250
It'll need a separate
formula to decide.

343
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,410
And it could use one step of
backward Euler to find u_1.

344
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:33,510
And then take off, now
finding u_2 from u_1 and u_0.

345
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,750
And then onward.

346
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,510
So that's quite fast.

347
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:40,100
More stable, good method.

348
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,660
And you maybe can see that
I could get more formulas

349
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,730
by going back further in time.

350
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,720
And by doing that I can
get the accuracy higher.

351
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,120
So that's good to see
that particular BDF2.

352
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,430
So that's a backward
difference formula.

353
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:09,300
Oh, just to mention
what's developed.

354
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:14,720
So this is stable.

355
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,140
It actually loses
a little energy.

356
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,360
So in fact now both
Professor Bathe and I

357
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:28,070
have studied the possibility
of taking a trapezoidal step,

358
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,900
which was a little dangerous
in the non-linear case

359
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,890
because you were
playing with fire,

360
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,630
you were right on the circle.

361
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:39,100
And then put in a
backward difference step

362
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,210
to recover a little stability.

363
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,170
And then trapezoidal
backward difference.

364
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,710
So split step.

365
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,520
Split the step into a
trapezoidal part and a backward

366
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,340
difference part.

367
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,350
That's actually discussed
later in Chapter 2.

368
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,200
Section 2.6 and I might
come back to that.

369
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,150
I just wanted to say
that much this morning.

370
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:10,650
Having got as far as
forward and backward Euler.

371
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,570
I didn't want to leave you
without a better method which

372
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,660
is the trapezoidal method.

373
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:23,600
I could take any question.

374
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,850
I would like to devote
the second half,

375
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,840
if you're okay to
just change gear,

376
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,460
to beginning on least squares.

377
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:40,660
So this was our
kind of excitement

378
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,410
to have time dependence
for a little while.

379
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:48,280
But now I'm going back
to steady-state problems.

380
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,870
So they're not moving.

381
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,970
I'm looking at equilibrium.

382
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:57,630
And what I'm going to do
now in the next lectures

383
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:06,470
is more to see this framework
that we identified once

384
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,680
for the masses and springs,
to see it again and again.

385
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,600
Because it's the basic
framework of applied math.

386
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,330
So now I'm ready
for least squares.

387
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,300
Least squares.

388
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,700
What's the problem?

389
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,120
Well the problem is I'm given
a system of equations Au=f.

390
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:34,240


391
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:42,410
These f's are observations.

392
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,850
The u is the unknown vector.

393
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,520
You say what's different here?

394
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,480
It's just a linear system.

395
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,190
What's different is
too many equations.

396
00:25:53,190 --> 00:26:01,220
This is an m by n matrix
with m bigger than n.

397
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,550
Maybe much bigger than n.

398
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,200
So what do we do?

399
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:18,920
We've got too many equations and
no solution, no exact solution.

400
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,980
I would say probably that
what we're coming to,

401
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,390
what we're starting on
today is the most important,

402
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,500
the application of linear
algebra that I see the most.

403
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,830
So it interests everybody.

404
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:36,650
It interests engineers,
scientists, statisticians,

405
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:43,680
everybody has to deal with this
problem of too many equations.

406
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,170
And those equations
come from measurements

407
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,290
so you don't want
to throw them away.

408
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,360
I don't want to just throw away.

409
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,480
I want to somehow get
the best solution.

410
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,980
I'm looking for the
u that comes closest

411
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,920
when I can't find an exact u.

412
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,290
So that's the idea.

413
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,120
There's no exact
solution and the problem

414
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:12,080
is what is the best u.

415
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,920
And I'm going to
call that u hat.

416
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,960
My favorite choice
of u will be u hat.

417
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,460
So I'm going to get
an equation for u hat.

418
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,110
That is my goal.

419
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:31,810
And what I'm starting here
just goes all the way to,

420
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,940
there will be weighted
least squares,

421
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,380
there will be Kalman filters.

422
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,420
It's a giant world
here of estimating

423
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,940
the best solution when there's
noise in the right-hand side.

424
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,520
And what's the model problem?

425
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,360
Always good to have
a model problem.

426
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,600
Let me draw a model problem.

427
00:27:51,600 --> 00:28:00,550
Model problem is fit
by a straight line.

428
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,040
So say C+Dt.

429
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,650


430
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,750
Shall I use that as the--?

431
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,130
C+Dx.

432
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,030
It's got two unknowns.

433
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,310
So n is two.

434
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:21,100
But m is big.

435
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,330
What do I have?

436
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,520
Let me draw the picture.

437
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,030
You've seen this often.

438
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,870
This is the t-direction,
this is the f.

439
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,140
These are the measurements.

440
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:39,170
So I measure at
time t=0, let's say.

441
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:45,300
I measure my position.

442
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,140
That would be f_1.

443
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:51,130
At time t=1 I've
moved somewhere,

444
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,290
I've measured where I am.

445
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,740
I'm tracking a
satellite, let's say.

446
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,700
So I'm tracking this satellite.

447
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,410
Well the times don't have
to be equally spaced.

448
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:03,570
I'll take the next
time to be three.

449
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:10,590
Let's say the engine
is off, this satellite.

450
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,630
If the measurements
were perfect--

451
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:16,520
Does that look too
perfect to you?

452
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,870
It's almost on a
straight line, isn't it?

453
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:23,270
Of course my point is that
measurements, well I mean,

454
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,560
of course in
reality measurements

455
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,190
would be close to
a straight line.

456
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,380
I'm going to have to draw, in
order for you to see anything,

457
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,990
I'm going to have
to draw a really--

458
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,520
Suppose f_1 is one.

459
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:46,410
Suppose it starts at position
one and suppose f_2 is two

460
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:53,200
and this guy will be-- Where
do you want me to take it?

461
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,160
Let's see, if it was
linear, what would be the--?

462
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,240
It would be four, right?

463
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,640
So can I take a
different number?

464
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,710
Three.

465
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,600
Is three okay?

466
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,180
Because five I
haven't got space for.

467
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,810
And you don't want to see
pi or some dumb thing or e.

468
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:20,960
So let me take three.

469
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,370
I want to fit that
data which is,

470
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,520
we're saying, close
to a straight line,

471
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,360
I want to fit it by
the best straight line.

472
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,350
So the best straight
line would go probably,

473
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,010
I don't know what
your eyes suggest

474
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,120
for the best straight
line through three points.

475
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,290
Do you see I've got three
equations, two unknowns?

476
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,730
That's the first point to see.

477
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:46,630
Somehow I'm trying to fit
three things with only two

478
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,440
degrees of freedom and I'm
not going to succeed, usually.

479
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,030
But I'm going to do my best
and probably the best line

480
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:59,420
goes sort of, it won't exactly
go through any of them.

481
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,970
So I'm doing the best least
squares approximation.

482
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,210
And what does that mean?

483
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,160
Well, what would the
three equations be?

484
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,990
What does my linear
equations, my unsolvable ones,

485
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,460
say that at time zero?

486
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,730
So at time zero, at time
one and at time three,

487
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:24,200
at each of those times I have
an equation C+Dt should agree

488
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:31,070
with-- So that C plus D
times zero should match f_1.

489
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:40,140
At t=1 my line will be
C+D*1, it should equal f_2.

490
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:46,570
And at t=3, the height
of the line will be C+3D,

491
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,950
and I would like it to go
through that height f_3.

492
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,780


493
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:58,780
But I'm not going to
be able-- If there

494
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,110
was noise in the measurements
that system, that's

495
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:06,140
my unsolvable system.

496
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,660
What's the matrix?

497
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,660
I want to write three
equations and you're

498
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:19,700
getting good at seeing
three equations like so.

499
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:24,810
So I've a 3 by 2 matrix.

500
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,710
And my unknown u is [C, D].

501
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,140
Those are my unknowns.

502
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,190
And my right-hand sides
are these heights, well,

503
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:40,720
I decided on particular
numbers, one, two and three.

504
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,420
One, two, three.

505
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,480
And what's the matrix?

506
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,160
What's the matrix A that
you read off when you

507
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,040
see that system of equations?

508
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,750
The first column
of the matrix is?

509
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,720
All ones because that's
multiplying the C's.

510
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,980
And the second column of
the matrix is the times.

511
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,380
Zero, one, three, is that right?

512
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:08,070
That multiply the D. So
this is the same as that.

513
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,840
So here I'm in my set-up.

514
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:24,510
I'll erase m equal big because
m was only three, not that big.

515
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:30,060
What's the best answer?

516
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,010
What's the best u hat?

517
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:38,770
The best u hat will
now be C hat and D hat.

518
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:45,730
The best I can do.

519
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:50,920
I need some idea of
what does best mean.

520
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,520
And there is not a
single possible meaning.

521
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,670
There are many possible ways
I could say the best line.

522
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:05,830
One way would be
to make the, well,

523
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,110
what could a best line be?

524
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,510
I'm going to have three
errors here, right?

525
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,190
That did not go right
through the point.

526
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,970
This did not go right
through the point.

527
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,470
They came pretty close.

528
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:23,280
I've got three small
errors. e_1, e_2, e_3.

529
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,510
Those are the errors
in my equations.

530
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:31,690
So I will get equality when
I add in the e_1, e_2, e_3,

531
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:39,680
the little bits that will
bring it onto the line.

532
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,820
One idea.

533
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:46,880
Make the largest error
as small as I can.

534
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:54,730
Minimize the maximum of the e's
Try to balance them so no e,

535
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,790
no error is bigger
than the others.

536
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,630
Look for that balance.

537
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:04,770
That's a reasonable idea.

538
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,360
But it's not the
least squares idea.

539
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,290
So what's the
least squares idea?

540
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,680
The least squares
idea makes the sum

541
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,640
of the squares of the
errors as small as possible.

542
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:29,075
So the least squares idea
will be to minimize the sum

543
00:35:29,075 --> 00:35:33,550
of the squares of the
errors. e_1 squared plus...

544
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,940
e_m squared.

545
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,610
It would be just e_1
squared plus e_2 squared

546
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,440
plus e_3 squared.

547
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,710
What is this?

548
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,240
Let me began to write
this in matrix--

549
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,240
I want to bring in
the matrix here.

550
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,210
This is the error.

551
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:00,670
The error is the difference
between the measurements

552
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,650
and Au.

553
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,820
So that's what I'm
trying to make small.

554
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,680
I'd love to make it
zero but I can't.

555
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,080
I've got more equations
than unknowns.

556
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,410
There's no two unknowns that
will make all three errors

557
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,680
zero.

558
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,950
So I want to make
the errors small.

559
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,620
And this is the
length of e squared.

560
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:30,110
The length in this
sum of squares method.

561
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:37,900
It's a pretty good
measure of the error.

562
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,800
Gauss was the first to
apply least squares.

563
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,740
What I'm going to
do today is Gauss.

564
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,620
Who was, by the way, the
greatest mathematician

565
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,030
of all time.

566
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,910
And here, he was doing
astronomy actually.

567
00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:03,750
And writing in Latin.

568
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,750
The message got out somehow.

569
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:12,420
So his idea was sum of squares.

570
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:18,510
So this e is the distance
between f and Au.

571
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:22,340
I have to begin to write.

572
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,960
I have to write some things.

573
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,740
I can write some things out
in detail, but then I also,

574
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,900
at the same time,
have to carry along

575
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,410
the way I would look
at it for any matrix A

576
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,210
and any right-hand side f.

577
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,370
So do you see that
this is the error?

578
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:44,040
The meaning of this double
bars squared is exactly that.

579
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,670
That it's the sum of the
squares of the components.

580
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:54,190
So that's where the word
least squares come in.

581
00:37:54,190 --> 00:38:02,920
Can I just say what's
better about least squares

582
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,660
and what's maybe a drawback.

583
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,510
So actually this
next sentence is

584
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,150
pretty important in practice.

585
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,340
What's better about
least squares, what's

586
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,190
really nice about
least squares is well,

587
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,960
for one thing, the equations
we get for the best [C, D]

588
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,620
will be linear, will
be linear equations.

589
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,810
You may say, not
surprising, I started out

590
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,955
with a linear
system and I'm going

591
00:38:35,955 --> 00:38:39,040
to end up with a linear system.

592
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,030
Actually I prefer to use--
Well, might be too late.

593
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,090
Next lecture I'm going
to put b in there

594
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,340
for the right-hand side.

595
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:54,000
But I'll leave it
with that for now.

596
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,420
So good point is we'll
get linear equations.

597
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:04,810
The not so good point
in some applications

598
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:11,380
is when I look at the
squares of errors,

599
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:18,290
well big errors, outliers,
really bad measurements

600
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,650
have a big influence
on the answer

601
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,590
because of getting squared.

602
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:30,620
So if I have ten readings that
are very accurate but then

603
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:35,660
in an eleventh reading that
is way off and I don't know it

604
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,890
and if I don't realize
that that's way off, then

605
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:43,770
that eleventh error
will-- It's like having

606
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,550
a whole lot of points
close to a line

607
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,040
and then another point way off.

608
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:55,250
That will have a significant
effect on the best line.

609
00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:02,240
So you might say
too great an effect.

610
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,570
Depends on the application.

611
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:10,900
I just had to say before
starting on least squares,

612
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:16,790
as always, there are
advantages and disadvantages

613
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,880
but the advantages
are very, very great.

614
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,780
So it's an important
idea here, least squares.

615
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:31,650
I'm ready now to ask for
the equation for u hat.

616
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:38,700
So the equation for u hat is
the u that minimizes here.

617
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:45,880
So we have touched on
minimizing quadratics.

618
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:54,060
This is squares.

619
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:59,670
I could expand that out as
f minus A u transpose times

620
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:06,700
f minus Au just to see
another way to write it.

621
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,050
The length squared of a vector
is always the transpose--

622
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,030
Its inner product with itself.

623
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:19,090
And I could split this out
into all these different terms.

624
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,040
I would have then, some
quadratic expression

625
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,480
to minimize.

626
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,940
In other words, let
me jump to the answer.

627
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,540
Let me jump to the
equation for the best u.

628
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:38,570
And then come back to see why.

629
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,990
Because you must see
what that equation is.

630
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,720
It's the fundamental
equation of, this

631
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,280
might be called linear
regression, fitting data.

632
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,570
You're just constantly doing it.

633
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:56,280
So what is the equation
for the best u hat?

634
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,480
Can I put it here?

635
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,400
This'll be equation
that we get to.

636
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,960
It'll be A transpose
A. You're not

637
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,040
surprised to see A
transpose A up here.

638
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,920
First of all because
this is 18.085

639
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,050
and also because
this A is rectangular

640
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:16,760
and when you have
rectangular matrices,

641
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,480
sooner or later A
transpose A comes up.

642
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,670
So that's the matrix.

643
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:26,860
And then the right-hand
side is A transpose f.

644
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,490
So that's the key equation
for least squares.

645
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:33,870
That's the central
equation of least squares.

646
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,480
And let's just see
what it looks like.

647
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,350
You could say the
way I arrived at it,

648
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,620
I mean the short way is
this is an equation that I

649
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,810
can't satisfy.

650
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:55,570
I multiply both
sides by A transpose

651
00:42:55,570 --> 00:43:00,050
and now this is the
equation for u hat.

652
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:05,150
And what that did was kind of
average out the m equations.

653
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,920
Because how many
equations do I now have?

654
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,700
A as m by n.

655
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,420
What's the shape
of A transpose A?

656
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,650
Everybody's on top
of that, right?

657
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:21,350
The shape of A transpose
A is square, n by n.

658
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:28,960
Because A transpose is n
by m. n by m times m by n

659
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,610
leaves us an n by n.

660
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:34,060
So we've averaged
the m equations

661
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:38,900
that were too many
to get n equations.

662
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:47,410
And of course this is what it
should be, n by m, m by one.

663
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:48,520
So it's n by one.

664
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,500
It's a good right-hand side.

665
00:43:51,500 --> 00:44:02,030
That's the equation
of least squares.

666
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:07,300
That's the equation I want to
explain, understand and solve.

667
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,520
Actually why don't we solve
it for this particular problem

668
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:17,210
just to see the whole
thing for this example.

669
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:22,060
Just to do it.

670
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,980
So there is A. Here is u.

671
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:32,900
And here is f. what
shall I call these?

672
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,310
They're mostly called
the normal equations.

673
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:42,110
That's one possible word for the
key equation of least squares,

674
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:44,610
the normal equations.

675
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:47,990
Can you tell me these
matrices A transpose A?

676
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:50,320
And u hat I know.

677
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,460
That'll be the best
C and the best D.

678
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:59,390
And over here can you
compute A transpose f?

679
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,730
If I write A transpose
above it, will that

680
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:05,500
help you do these
multiplications?

681
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,580
Let me just do.

682
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:12,650
So there was the matrix A. Let
me write A transpose above it.

683
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:22,900
So it has a row of ones
and then a row of times.

684
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,380
So what shape is the matrix?

685
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,470
The A transpose A matrix.

686
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,480
It's going to be that A
transpose times that A.

687
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,550
The size will be
two by two, right?

688
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,890
Two by three times
three by two, it's

689
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:43,530
averaging out to get
me a two by two matrix.

690
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:46,130
What's the first entry of this?

691
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:50,890
Can you do A transpose times
A just so we see this matrix.

692
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,220
Three.

693
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,790
And off the diagonal?

694
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,630
Four.

695
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:56,900
And here?

696
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,490
And you knew it
would be symmetric.

697
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:59,790
And here?

698
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,660
Ten.

699
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,700
And tell me A transpose
f while we're at it.

700
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,470
So that's just a vector.

701
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:11,340
If you multiply that by
the right-hand sides,

702
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,650
looks like a six.

703
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:18,640
Is that right?

704
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,210
11, maybe.

705
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:24,020
Is that right?

706
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:29,730
Two, nine making 11, yeah.

707
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,110
So those are the numbers.

708
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:35,710
I can't write those numbers,
write A transpose A,

709
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,390
without asking you to tell
me one more time what kind

710
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:42,640
of a matrix have I got here?

711
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,770
It's symmetric positive
definite, right?

712
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,840
We know that's going to be.

713
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,430
And we see it.

714
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:54,230
Our test for positive definite
might be the determinant,

715
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:57,030
that one by one
determinant is three,

716
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:04,870
that two by two determinant
is 30 minus 16, 14, positive.

717
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,710
We got a good problem here.

718
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,750
And I could solve
for C hat and D hat.

719
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,730
I see the numbers are not
coming out fantastically

720
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:18,530
but they would produce a line
that would, I'm pretty sure,

721
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:25,310
it would be, this
looks optimal to me.

722
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:29,570
If I rotated any, I'm
going to make things worse.

723
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:31,480
I think it would look like that.

724
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,590
So that's the system
that you end up with.

725
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,790
But why?

726
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:41,740
You really have to
understand, where

727
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,710
did this equation come from.

728
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:50,010
Where did it come from?

729
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:56,380
It's worth understanding,
this least squares stuff.

730
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:01,690
So I'm going to try to draw
a picture that makes it clear

731
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:08,190
where that equation comes from.

732
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,560
So what am I doing here?

733
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,060
Au=f.

734
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,040


735
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,130
Start there.

736
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,130
And the particular
A was, I'll even

737
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:25,230
copy the A. It was
1, 1, 1; 0, 1, 3,

738
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:30,400
multiplied u to give
me f as [0,  1, 3].

739
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,290
But of course, I
couldn't solve it

740
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:35,550
because I don't have
enough unknowns.

741
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:39,740
What's the picture?

742
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:46,540
Everybody likes to see
what's happening by a picture

743
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,170
as well as by algebra.

744
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:55,750
So the picture here is
I'm in three dimensions

745
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,820
and I have a vector [0, 1, 3].

746
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:01,480
So 0 in that direction,
one in that, three up.

747
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:07,640
So somewhere there is my f.

748
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:15,760
Now I'll put in C, D here.

749
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,570
What is the equation
asking me to do?

750
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:22,630
Which actually, I won't be able
to do because I can't solve it.

751
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:35,610
But the equation, how do we see
a system of linear equations?

752
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,060
If I have a system
of linear equations

753
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,090
I'm looking for
numbers C and D so

754
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:52,230
that C times column one plus D
times column two gives me that.

755
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:55,180
That's how I think of
a system of equations.

756
00:49:55,180 --> 00:50:00,990
A combination of the columns.

757
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:04,400
Tell me, what vectors do I
get if I take combinations

758
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,160
of the columns.

759
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,160
Well, if I took the
combination C=1,

760
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,860
D=0 I would just get
the first column.

761
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:14,880
So that's a candidate. [1, 1,
 1], I don't know where that is.

762
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,380
Wherever [1, 1, 1] might be.

763
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,490
I'm not too sure where
to draw [1, 1, 1].

764
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:27,840
I want to go one there,
one there and one there.

765
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,350
Damn.

766
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:35,920
Let's define that to be the
vector [1, 1, 1] right there.

767
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,420
Wait.

768
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,000
You let me put that up
there and I didn't mean to,

769
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:48,770
right? f should be zero, what,
sorry? f was [1, 2, 3], yeah.

770
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:49,920
Damn!

771
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,010
Don't let me make mistakes.

772
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:57,780
These mistakes are permanent
if you let them slide by.

773
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:04,660
That's it, same point.

774
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,660
I didn't have the point
right in the first place

775
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,620
so now it's just perfect.

776
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:15,920
There it is.

777
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,250
Before of course,
if I had [0,  1, 3],

778
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:21,810
I could've solved the equation.

779
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:26,060
But with [1, 2, 3] I can't.

780
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,250
Here's the situation.

781
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:31,270
This vector is not a
combination of those two.

782
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:36,320
Because the combinations of two
vectors, what's the picture?

783
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,290
If I try to draw, if I look
at all combinations of two

784
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:44,940
vectors, [1, 1, 1] which
is that vector, [0, 1, 3]

785
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:49,880
which is maybe this
vector, let's just say.

786
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,010
If I take the combinations
of these two column vectors,

787
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,490
what do I get?

788
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:57,760
Now this is for
everybody to know.

789
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,640
If I take the combinations
of two vectors

790
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,170
here in three-dimensional
space I get a plane.

791
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:08,990
I get the plane that
contains those vectors.

792
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:14,450
So this I could call the column
plane or the column space.

793
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:21,650
This is all combinations
of the columns.

794
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:27,890
That's the same thing as
saying this is all the f's

795
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:38,650
that have exact solutions.

796
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:41,290
So let's just see this picture.

797
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:45,120
This particular right-hand side
is not in the plane, right?

798
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,630
That's my problem.

799
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:51,100
This particular vector f
points out of the plane.

800
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,740
But if I change
it a little, like

801
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,350
if I change it to [1, 2, 4].

802
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:57,790
Do you see that that would--?

803
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:01,110
What's different now that
I've changed it to [1, 2, 3]

804
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:05,220
for a moment?

805
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,820
What's different
about [1, 2,  4]?

806
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:11,890
Where is [1, 2, 4]
in my picture?

807
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:14,850
Do you see what's
great about [1, 2, 4]?

808
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,380
It is a combination.

809
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:20,520
Right? [1, 2, 4] is a
combination, with C=1, D=1.

810
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,560
It would satisfy the equation.

811
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,750
So where is [1, 2, 4]
in my picture?

812
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,410
It's in the plane.

813
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:38,770
The plane are the heights that
do lie on a straight line.

814
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:42,660
So the plane are all the
ones that I can get exactly.

815
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:49,440
But this vector, these
observations, [1, 2, 3],

816
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,660
I couldn't get exactly.

817
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,440
So let me-- In 30
seconds or less,

818
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,370
let me tell you the
best thing to do.

819
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:59,620
Or let you tell me
the best thing to do.

820
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,660
I have a right-hand side
that's not in the plane.

821
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,160
I can get my straight
lines correspond

822
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,610
to vectors, right-hand
sides that are in the plane.

823
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:10,990
So what do I do?

824
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:12,060
I project.

825
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:15,830
I take the nearest
point that is the plane

826
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:18,830
as my right-hand side.

827
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:21,040
I project down.

828
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,015
And it's that
projection that's going

829
00:54:23,015 --> 00:54:26,340
to lead us to the
equation that I'm

830
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:32,250
shooting for, A transpose A
u hat equals A transpose f.

831
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:38,760
This comes from projecting
f down into the plane

832
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,320
where straight lines
do work exactly.

833
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,570
So there's an error here
that I can't deal with.

834
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:50,170
And there's a part here,
the projection part,

835
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:52,240
that I can deal with.

836
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,300
This is important and
it's fun and we'll

837
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,480
come back to it Monday.

838
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,260
Thanks for patience.
