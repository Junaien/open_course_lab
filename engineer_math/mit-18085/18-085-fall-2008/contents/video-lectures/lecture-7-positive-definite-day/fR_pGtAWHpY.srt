9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,670
PROFESSOR STRANG: Finally we get
to positive definite matrices.

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,180
I've used the word and now
it's time to pin it down.

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,620
And so this would be my
thank you for staying with it

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,490
while we do this important
preliminary stuff

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,780
about linear algebra.

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,850
So starting the
next lecture we'll

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,660
really make a big start on
engineering applications.

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,250
But these matrices are going
to be the key to everything.

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:58,290
And I'll call these matrices
K. And positive definite,

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,200
I will only use that word
about a symmetric matrix.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,130
So the matrix is
already symmetric

20
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,730
and that means it
has real eigenvalues

21
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,820
and many other
important properties,

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,930
orthogonal eigenvectors.

23
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,960
And now we're asking for more.

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:25,630
And it's that extra
bit that is terrific

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,260
in all kinds of applications.

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,090
So if I can do this
bit of linear algebra.

27
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:38,880
So what's coming then, my review
session this afternoon at four,

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,460
I'm very happy that
we've got, I think,

29
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,150
the best MATLAB problem ever
invented, in 18.085 anyway.

30
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,410
So that should get onto the
website probably by tomorrow.

31
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,670
And Peter Buchak is
like the MATLAB person.

32
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,590
So his review sessions
are Friday at noon.

33
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,890
And I just saw him and
suggested Friday at noon

34
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,750
he might as well
just stay in here.

35
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,740
And knowing that
that isn't maybe

36
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,050
a good hour for everybody.

37
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:16,390
So you could see him also
outside of that hour.

38
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,670
But that's the hour
he will be ready

39
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,520
for all kinds of questions about
MATLAB or about the homeworks.

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,720
Actually you'll be probably
thinking more about, also

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,680
about the homework
questions on this topic.

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,910
Ready for positive definite?

43
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,750
You said yes, right?

44
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,180
And you have a hint
about these things.

45
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,880
So we have a symmetric
matrix and the beauty

46
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,190
is that it brings together
all of linear algebra.

47
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,670
Including elimination,
that's when we see pivots.

48
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,930
Including determinants which are
closely related to the pivots.

49
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,180
And what do I mean
by upper left?

50
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,310
I mean that if I have a three
by three symmetric matrix

51
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,350
and I want to test it
for positive definite,

52
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,690
and I guess actually
this would be the easiest

53
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,140
test if I had a tiny
matrix, three by three,

54
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,120
and I had numbers, then
this would be a good test.

55
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,413
The determinants-- By upper left
determinants I mean that one

56
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:33,170
by one determinant.

57
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,220
So just that first number
has to be positive.

58
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,900
Then the two by two determinant,
that times that minus that

59
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,230
times that has to be positive.

60
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,420
Oh I've already
been saying that.

61
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,290
Let me just put in some letters.

62
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,100
So a has to be positive.

63
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,620
This is symmetric,
so a times c has

64
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,310
to be bigger than b squared.

65
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,340
So that will tell us.

66
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,230
And then for two
by two we finish.

67
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,256
For three by three we would
also require the three

68
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:05,880
by three determinant
to be positive.

69
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,440
But already here
you're seeing one point

70
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,470
about a positive
definite matrix.

71
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,430
Its diagonal will
have to be positive.

72
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,020
And somehow its diagonal has
to be not just above zero,

73
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:25,140
but somehow it has
to defeat b squared.

74
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,690
So the diagonal has to
be somehow more positive

75
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,890
than whatever
negative stuff might

76
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,780
come from off the diagonal.

77
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,250
That's why I would need
a*c &gt; b squared.

78
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,120
So both of those
will be positive

79
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,600
and their product has to be
bigger than the other guy.

80
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,650
And then finally, a third test
is that all the eigenvalues

81
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,970
are positive.

82
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,500
And of course if I give you
a three by three matrix,

83
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,340
that's probably not
the easiest test

84
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,670
since you'd have to
find the eigenvalues.

85
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,490
Much easier to find the
determinants or the pivots.

86
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,400
Actually, just while I'm at it,
so the first pivot of course

87
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,170
is a itself.

88
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,140
No difficulty there.

89
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,580
The second pivot turns out
to be the ratio of a*c -

90
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,140
b squared to a.

91
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,840
So the connection between
pivots and determinants

92
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,210
is just really close.

93
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,320
Pivots are ratios
of determinants,

94
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,250
if you work it out.

95
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,930
The second pivot, maybe
I would call that d_2,

96
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:40,110
is the ratio of a*c
- b squared over a.

97
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,040
In other words it's
c minus b^2 / a.

98
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,250


99
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,790
Determinants are
positive and vice versa.

100
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,130
Then it's fantastic
that the eigenvalues

101
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,740
come into the picture.

102
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,510
So those are three ways,
three important properties

103
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,870
of a positive definite matrix.

104
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:08,770
But I'd like to make the
definition something different.

105
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,200
Now I'm coming to the meaning.

106
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,420
If I think of those as
the tests, that's done.

107
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:24,370
Now the meaning of
positive definite.

108
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,230
The meaning of positive
definite and the applications

109
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:32,540
are closely related to
looking for a minimum.

110
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:39,900
And so what I'm going to bring
in here-- So it's symmetric.

111
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:47,610
Now for a symmetric matrix I
want to introduce the energy.

112
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,580
So this is the reason why
it has so many applications

113
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,750
and such important
physical meaning is

114
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,910
that what I'm
about to introduce,

115
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,600
which is a function
of x, and here

116
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,940
it is, it's x transpose
times A, not A,

117
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:16,770
I'm sticking with K
for my matrix, times x.

118
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,870
I think of that as some f(x).

119
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,430
And let's just see what it
would be if the matrix was

120
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,510
two by two, [a, b; b, c].

121
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,330
Suppose that's my matrix.

122
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,770
We want to get a handle on
what, this is the first time

123
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:42,040
I've ever written something
that has x's times x's.

124
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,190
So it's going to be quadratic.

125
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,330
They're going to
be x's times x's.

126
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,190
And x is a general
vector of the right size

127
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,100
so it's got components x_1, x_2.

128
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,850
And there it's
transposed, so it's a row.

129
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,920
And now I put in
the [a, b; b,  c].

130
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,680
And then I put in x again.

131
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,090
This is going to give me a
very nice, simple, important

132
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,830
expression.

133
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,470
Depending on x_1 and x_2.

134
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,090
Now what is, can we do
that multiplication?

135
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:25,210
Maybe above I'll do the
multiplication of this pair

136
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,370
and then I have the
other guy to bring in.

137
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,230
So here, that
would be ax_1+bx_2.

138
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,040


139
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,850
And this would be bx_1+cx_2.

140
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,550


141
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:44,722
So that's the first,
that's this times this.

142
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:45,680
What am I going to get?

143
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,910
What shape, what size is
this result going to be?

144
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:56,140
This K is n by n. x is a column
vector. n by one. x transpose,

145
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,800
what's the shape of x transpose?

146
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,070
One by n?

147
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,400
So what's the total result?

148
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,100
One by one.

149
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,270
Just a number.

150
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,070
Just a function.

151
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,560
It's a number.

152
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,450
But it depends on the x's
and the matrix inside.

153
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,830
Can we do it now?

154
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,280
So I've got this to
multiply by this.

155
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,900
Do you see an x_1
squared showing up?

156
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,590
Yes, from there times there.

157
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,770
And what's it multiplied by?

158
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,260
The a.

159
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,830
The first term is this times
the ax_1 is a x_1 squared.

160
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,480
So that's our first quadratic.

161
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,360
Now there'd be an x_1, x_2.

162
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,820
Let me leave that for a minute
and find the x_2 squared

163
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,350
because it's easy.

164
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,440
So where am I going
to get x_2 squared?

165
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,650
I'm going to get that
from x_2, second guy

166
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,150
here times second guy here.

167
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:54,830
There's a c x_2 squared.

168
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,630
So you're seeing already
where the diagonal shows up.

169
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,330
The diagonal a, c,
whatever, is multiplying

170
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,600
the perfect squares.

171
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,820
And it'll be the off-diagonal
that multiplies the x_1 x_2.

172
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,210
We might call those
the cross terms.

173
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,160
And what do we
get for that then?

174
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,180
We have x_1 times this guy.

175
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,200
So that's a cross
term. bx_1*x_2, right?

176
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,270
And here's another one coming
from x_2 times this guy.

177
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,780
And what's that one?

178
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,080
It's also bx_1*x_2.

179
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,750
So x_1, multiply that,
x_2 multiply that,

180
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,210
and so what do we have
for this cross term here?

181
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,600
Two of them.

182
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,670
2bx_1*x_2.

183
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,350


184
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:48,160
In other words, that b
and that b came together

185
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,490
in the 2bx_1*x_2.

186
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:56,280
So here's my energy.

187
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,400
Can I just loosely
call it energy?

188
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,960
And then as we get to
applications we'll see why.

189
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,400
So I'm interested
in that because it

190
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,390
has important meaning.

191
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,770
Well, so now I'm ready to define
positive definite matrices.

192
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,690
So I'll call that number four.

193
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,860
But I'm going to
give it a big star.

194
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:29,670
Even more because
it's the sort of key.

195
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,010
So the test will be, you
can probably guess it,

196
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:41,630
I look at this expression,
that x transpose Ax.

197
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,250
And if it's a positive
definite matrix

198
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,340
and this represents
energy, the key

199
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,750
will be that this
should be positive.

200
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:57,120
This one should be
positive for all x's.

201
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,700
Well, with one
exception, of course.

202
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:07,530
All x's except, which vector
is it? x=0 would just give me--

203
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:17,390
See, I put K. My default for a
matrix, but should be, it's K.

204
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,340
Except x=0, except
the zero vector.

205
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,730
Of course.

206
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,940
If x_1 and x_2 are both zero.

207
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,720
Now that looks a little
maybe less straightforward,

208
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,760
I would say, because it's
a statement about this

209
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,940
is true for all x_1 and x_2.

210
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,760
And we better do some
examples and draw a picture.

211
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,670
Let me draw a
picture right away.

212
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,750
So here's x_1 direction.

213
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,420
Here's x_2 direction.

214
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:05,960
And here is the x
transpose Ax, my function.

215
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,160
So this depends
on two variables.

216
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,370
So it's going to be a sort
of a surface if I draw it.

217
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,650
Now, what point do
we absolutely know?

218
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:21,050
And I put A again.

219
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:29,560
I am so sorry.

220
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,840
Well, we know one point.

221
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,660
It's there whatever
that matrix might be.

222
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,680
It's there.

223
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,240
Zero, right?

224
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,300
You just told me that if
both x's are zero then

225
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,760
we automatically get zero.

226
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,100
Now what do you think
the shape of this curve,

227
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,280
the shape of this graph
is going to look like?

228
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,920
The point is, if we're
positive definite now.

229
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,980
So I'm drawing the picture
for positive definite.

230
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,610
So my definition is
that the energy goes up.

231
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,650
It's positive, right?

232
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,320
When I leave, when I move away
from that point I go upwards.

233
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,540
That point will be a minimum.

234
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,740
Let me just draw it roughly.

235
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,500
So it sort of goes up like this.

236
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:30,670
These cheap 2-D boards and I've
got a three-dimensional picture

237
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,370
here.

238
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,780
But you see it somehow?

239
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:40,300
What word or what's
your visualization?

240
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,100
It has a minimum there.

241
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,840
That's why minimization,
which was like,

242
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,140
the core problem in
calculus, is here now.

243
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,870
But for functions
of two x's or n x's.

244
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,930
We're up the dimension over
the basic minimum problem

245
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,730
of calculus.

246
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,260
It's sort of like a parabola.

247
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,960
Its cross-sections cutting
down through the thing

248
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,550
would be just parabolas
because of the x squared.

249
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,890
I'm going to call this a bowl.

250
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,050
It's a short word.

251
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,840
Do you see it?

252
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,280
It opens up.

253
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,870
That's the key point,
that it opens upward.

254
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,920
And let's do some examples.

255
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,000
Tell me some positive definite.

256
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,170
So positive definite
and then let

257
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:35,910
me here put some not
positive definite cases.

258
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,360
Tell me a matrix.

259
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,050
Well, what's the
easiest, first matrix

260
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,710
that occurs to you as a
positive definite matrix?

261
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:49,230
The identity.

262
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,090
That passes all our tests,
its eigenvalues are one,

263
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,890
its pivots are one, the
determinants are one.

264
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,830
And the function is
x_1 squared plus x_2

265
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:05,520
squared with no b in it.

266
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,590
It's just a perfect bowl,
perfectly symmetric,

267
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,190
the way it would come
off a potter's wheel.

268
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,190
Now let me take one
that's maybe not so,

269
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,410
let me put a nine there.

270
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,310
So I'm off to a
reasonable start.

271
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,090
I have an x_1 squared
and a nine x_2 squared.

272
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,890
And now I want to
ask you, what could I

273
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:30,410
put in there that would
leave it positive definite?

274
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,430
Well, give me a couple
of possibilities.

275
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,800
What's a nice, not too
big now, that's the thing.

276
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,550
Two.

277
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,850
Two would be fine.

278
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,540
So if I had a two there and
a two there I would have

279
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,000
a 4x_1*x_2 and it
would, like, this,

280
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,720
instead of being a circle,
which it was for the identity,

281
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,230
the plane there would cut
out a ellipse instead.

282
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,750
But it would be a good ellipse.

283
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,730
Because we're doing
squares, we're really,

284
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,960
the Greeks understood
these second degree things

285
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:18,540
and they would have known this
would have been an ellipse.

286
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,070
How high can I go with that
two or where do I have to stop?

287
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:27,660
Where would I have to, if
I wanted to change the two,

288
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,080
let me just focus on that one,
suppose I wanted to change it.

289
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,510
First of all, give
me one that's,

290
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,900
how about the borderline.

291
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,610
Three would be the borderline.

292
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,410
Why's that?

293
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:48,100
Because at three we have nine
minus nine for the determinant.

294
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,500
So the determinant is zero.

295
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,350
Of course it passed
the first test.

296
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,920
One by one was okay.

297
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:03,840
But two by two was not,
was at the borderline.

298
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,850
What else should I think?

299
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,230
Oh, that's a very
interesting case.

300
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,320
The borderline.

301
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,660
You know, it almost makes it.

302
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,860
But can you tell me the
eigenvalues of that matrix?

303
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,100
Don't do any
quadratic equations.

304
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,220
How do I know, what's one
eigenvalue of a matrix?

305
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,330
You made it singular, right?

306
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,770
You made that matrix singular.

307
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,730
Determinant zero.

308
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,030
So one of its
eigenvalues is zero.

309
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,180
And the other one is visible
by looking at the trace.

310
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,090
I just quickly mentioned
that if I add the diagonal,

311
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,850
I get the same answer as if
I add the two eigenvalues.

312
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,180
So that other
eigenvalue must be ten.

313
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,940
And this is entirely
typical, that ten and zero,

314
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,640
the extreme eigenvalues,
lambda_max and lambda_min,

315
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,300
are bigger than-- these
diagonal guys are inside.

316
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,180
They're inside,
between zero and ten

317
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,580
and it's these terms that
enter somehow and gave us

318
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,880
an eigenvalue of ten and
an eigenvalue of zero.

319
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,320
I guess I'm tempted to
try to draw that figure.

320
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,560
Just to get a feeling
of what's with that one.

321
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,140
It always helps to get
the borderline case.

322
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,320
So what's with this one?

323
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,630
Let me see what my
quadratic would be.

324
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,760
Can I just change it up here?

325
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,970
Rather than rewriting it.

326
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,000
So I'm going to,
I'll put it up here.

327
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,240
So I have to change
that four to what?

328
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,810
Now that I'm looking
at this matrix.

329
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,960
That four is now a six.

330
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,900
Six.

331
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,880
This is my guy for this one.

332
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,862
Which is not positive definite.

333
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:00,320
Let me tell you
right away the word

334
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,260
that I would use for this one.

335
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,820
I would call it positive
semi-definite because it's

336
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,500
almost there, but not quite.

337
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,300
So semi-definite allows
the matrix to be singular.

338
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,180
So semi-definite,
maybe I'll do it

339
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,350
in green what
semi-definite would be.

340
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:31,700
Semi-def would be eigenvalues
greater than or equal zero.

341
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,160
Determinants greater
than or equal zero.

342
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,440
Pivots greater than zero
if they're there or then

343
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,410
we run out of pivots.

344
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,490
You could say greater than
or equal to zero then.

345
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,740
And energy, greater
than or equal to zero

346
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:53,110
for semi-definite.

347
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:58,380
And when would the energy, what
x's, what would be the like,

348
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,090
you could say the ground
states or something,

349
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,420
what x's-- So greater
than or equal to zero,

350
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,080
emphasize that possibility
of equal in the semi-definite

351
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,100
case.

352
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:17,300
Suppose I have a semi-definite
matrix, yeah, I've got one.

353
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,690
But it's singular.

354
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:26,160
So that means a singular matrix
takes some vector x to zero.

355
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,700
Right?

356
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,080
If my matrix is
actually singular,

357
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,990
then there'll be an
x where Kx is zero.

358
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,000
And then, of course,
multiplying by x transpose,

359
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,350
I'm still at zero.

360
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:41,900
So the x's, the zero energy
guys, this is straightforward,

361
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:49,180
the zero energy guys, the ones
where x transpose Kx is zero,

362
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:56,730
will happen when Kx is zero.

363
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:03,210
If Kx is zero, and we'll
see it in that example.

364
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,140
Let's see it in that example.

365
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:12,300
What's the x for
which, I could say

366
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,170
in the null space,
what's the vector x

367
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,830
that that matrix kills?

368
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,490


369
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,146
[3, -1], right?

370
00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:24,770
The vector [3, -1].

371
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:30,600
[3, -1] gives me [0, 0].

372
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,360
That's the vector that-- So
I get 3-3, the zero, 9-9,

373
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,710
the zero.

374
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:40,700
So I believe that
this thing will

375
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,750
be-- Is it zero at [3, -1]?

376
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,530
I think that it
has to be, right?

377
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,040
If I take x_1 to be three
and x_2 to be minus one,

378
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,400
I think I've got
zero energy here.

379
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,630
Do I? x_1 squared will be
nine and nine x_2 squared

380
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,210
will be nine more.

381
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,160
And what will be this 6x_1*x_2?

382
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:09,250
What will that come out
for this x_1 and x_2?

383
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,530
Minus 18.

384
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,950
Had to, right?

385
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,620
So I'd get nine from there,
nine from there, minus 18, zero.

386
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,660
So the graph for this
positive semi-definite

387
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,050
will look a bit like this.

388
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:26,060
There'll be a direction
in which it doesn't climb.

389
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,560
It doesn't go below
the base, right?

390
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,340
It's never negative.

391
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,190
This is now the
semi-definite picture.

392
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,260
But it can run along the base.

393
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,390
And it will for the
vector x_1=3, x_2=-1,

394
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,520
I don't know where that
is, one, two, three,

395
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,910
and then maybe minus one.

396
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:51,520
Along some line here
the graph doesn't go up.

397
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,940
It's sitting, can you imagine
that sitting in the base?

398
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:05,870
I'm not Rembrandt here, but in
the other direction it goes up.

399
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,240
Oh, the hell with that one.

400
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,650
Do you see, sort of?

401
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,270
It's like a trough,
would you say?

402
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,740
I mean, it's like
a, you know, a bit

403
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,720
of a drainpipe or something.

404
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:27,300
It's running along the ground,
along this [3, -1] direction

405
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,180
and in the other
directions it does go up.

406
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:35,480
So it's shaped like this
with the base not climbing.

407
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,020
Whereas here, there's
no bad direction.

408
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,900
Climbs every way you go.

409
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,440
So that's positive definite and
that's positive semi-definite.

410
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,770
Well suppose I push
it a little further.

411
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:56,510
Let me make a place here
for a matrix that isn't

412
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:01,350
even positive semi-definite.

413
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,180
Now it's just going
to go down somewhere.

414
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,010
I'll start again
with one and nine

415
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,850
and tell me what to put in now.

416
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,480
So this is going to be a case
where the off-diagonal is

417
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,740
too big, it wins.

418
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,160
And prevents positive definite.

419
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,410
So what number
would you like here?

420
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,770
Five?

421
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,960
Five is certainly plenty.

422
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,600
So now I have [1, 5; 5, 9].

423
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,440
Let me take a little space
on a board just to show you.

424
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,190
Sorry about that.

425
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,450
So I'm going to do
the [1, 5; 5,  9]

426
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,800
just because they're
all important,

427
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,480
but then we're coming
back to positive definite.

428
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:57,510
So if it's [1, 5; 5, 9] and
I do that usual x transpose

429
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:03,890
Kx and I do the multiplication
out, I see the one x_1 squared

430
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,750
and I see the nine x_2 squareds.

431
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:11,690
And how many x_1*x_2's do I see?

432
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,480
Five from there,
five from there, ten.

433
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,800
And I believe that
can be negative.

434
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,220
The fact of having
all nice plus signs

435
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,970
is not going to help it
because we can choose,

436
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:30,030
as we already did, x_1 to be
like a negative number and x_2

437
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,350
to be a positive.

438
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:35,180
And we can get this guy to
be negative and make it,

439
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:41,040
in this case we can make it
defeat these positive parts.

440
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,590
What choice would do it?

441
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,560
Let me take x_1 to be
minus one and tell me

442
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:53,760
an x_2 that's good enough to
show that this thing is not

443
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,520
positive definite or
even semi-definite,

444
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,360
it goes downhill.

445
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,570
Take x_2 equal?

446
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:04,030
What do you say?

447
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,460
1/2?

448
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,250
Yeah, I don't want
too big an x_2

449
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,910
because if I have too big an
x_2, then this'll be important.

450
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,550
Does 1/2 do it?

451
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,040
So I've got 1/4, that's
positive, but not very.

452
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:23,610
9/4, so I'm up to 10/4,
but this guy is what?

453
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,531
Ten and the minus is minus five.

454
00:27:26,531 --> 00:27:27,030
Yeah.

455
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:35,370
So that absolutely goes, at this
one I come out less than zero.

456
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,170
And I might as well complete.

457
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:43,890
So this is the case where
I would call it indefinite.

458
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,190
Indefinite.

459
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:49,240
It goes up, like if
x_2 is zero, then

460
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,170
it's just got x_1
squared, that's up.

461
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,750
If x_1 is zero, it's only
got x_2 squared, that's up.

462
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,890
But there are other directions
where it goes downhill.

463
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,100
So it goes either up-- it
goes both up in some ways

464
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,160
and down in others.

465
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,760
And what kind of a graph,
what kind of a surface

466
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,160
would I now have for x
transpose for this x transpose,

467
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,690
this indefinite guy?

468
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:26,400
So up in some ways
and down in others.

469
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:35,150
This gets really hard to draw.

470
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:39,890
I believe that if
you ride horses

471
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:43,090
you have an edge on
visualizing this.

472
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,760
So it's called, what kind
of a point's it called?

473
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,260
Saddle point, it's
called a saddle point.

474
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,890
So what's a saddle point?

475
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,460
That's not bad, right?

476
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,650
So this is a direction
where it went up.

477
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:02,210
This is a direction
where it went down.

478
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:09,440
And so it sort of
fills in somehow.

479
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:18,330
Or maybe, if you don't, I
mean, who rides horses now?

480
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:25,190
Actually maybe something we
do do is drive over mountains.

481
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:35,380
So the path, if the road
is sort of well-chosen,

482
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,250
the road will go,
it'll look for the,

483
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,540
this would be-- Yeah,
here's our road.

484
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,310
We would do as little
climbing as possible.

485
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,860
The mountain would go
like this, sort of.

486
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,320
So this would be
like, the bottom part

487
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,630
looking along the
peaks of the mountains.

488
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,410
But it's the top part looking
along the driving direction.

489
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:05,590
So driving, it's a maximum, but
in the mountain range direction

490
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,320
it's a minimum.

491
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,500
So it's a saddle point.

492
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,810
So that's what you get from
a typical symmetric matrix.

493
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:19,010
And if it was minus five it
would still be the same saddle

494
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:23,480
point, would still be
9-25, it would still

495
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,130
be negative and a saddle.

496
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,200
Positive guys are our thing.

497
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,000
Alright.

498
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,230
So now back to
positive definite.

499
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,650
With these four tests
and then the discussion

500
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,680
of semi-definite.

501
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,150
Very key, that energy.

502
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,970
Let me just look ahead a moment.

503
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:58,650
Most physical problems,
many, many physical problems,

504
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,010
you have an option.

505
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,810
Either you solve some equations,
either you find the solution

506
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:10,040
from our equations,
Ku=f, typically.

507
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,670
Matrix equation or
differential equation.

508
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:20,940
Or there's another option
of minimizing some function.

509
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,640
Some energy.

510
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,850
And it gives the same equations.

511
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:30,680
So this minimizing energy
will be a second way

512
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:36,720
to describe the applications.

513
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,760
Now can I get a number five?

514
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,660
There's an important
number five and then

515
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:48,130
you know really all you need to
know about symmetric matrices.

516
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,630
This gives me, about
positive definite matrices,

517
00:31:51,630 --> 00:32:01,750
this gives me a chance to recap.

518
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:06,400
So I'm going to put
down a number five.

519
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:16,540
Because this is where
the matrices come from.

520
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,480
Really important.

521
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,390
And it's where they'll come
from in all these applications

522
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,230
that chapter two is going
to be all about, that we're

523
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,600
going to start.

524
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,500
So they come, these
positive definite matrices,

525
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:34,290
so this is another
way to, it's a test

526
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:39,180
for positive definite matrices
and it's, actually, it's

527
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,930
where they come from.

528
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:44,340
So here's a positive
definite matrix.

529
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:54,270
They come from A transpose
A. A fundamental message is

530
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,090
that if I have just
an average matrix,

531
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:01,840
possibly rectangular, could
be a square but not symmetric,

532
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,220
then sooner or later,
in fact usually sooner,

533
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,430
you end up looking
at A transpose A.

534
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,940
We've seen that already.

535
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,390
And we already know that
A transpose A is square,

536
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,950
we already know it's
symmetric and now

537
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,980
we're going to know that
it's positive definite.

538
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:25,140
So matrices like A transpose
A are positive definite

539
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,140
or possibly semi-definite.

540
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,660
There's that possibility.

541
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,920
If A was the zero
matrix, of course,

542
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,820
we would just get
the zero matrix which

543
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,460
would be only
semi-definite, or other ways

544
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:42,120
to get a semi-definite.

545
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,720
So I'm saying that if K, if
I have a matrix, any matrix,

546
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,770
and I form A transpose A, I
get a positive definite matrix

547
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:56,780
or maybe just semi-definite,
but not indefinite.

548
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:01,850
Can we see why?

549
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:11,900
Why is this positive
definite or semi-?

550
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,740
So that's my question.

551
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,490
And the answer is
really worth-- it's

552
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,070
just neat and worth seeing.

553
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,970
So do I want to look at the
pivots of A transpose A?

554
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,970
No.

555
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,910
They're something,
but whatever they are,

556
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,460
I can't really
follow those well.

557
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,870
Or the eigenvalues very
well, or the determinants.

558
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,790
None of those come out nicely.

559
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:41,690
But the real guy
works perfectly.

560
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:46,060
So look at x transpose Kx.

561
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,580


562
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:57,190
So I'm just doing--
following my instinct here.

563
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,590
So if K is A
transpose A, my claim

564
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:07,050
is, what am I saying
then about this energy?

565
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:13,090
What is it that I want to
discover and understand?

566
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,630
Why it's positive.

567
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,820
Why does taking any
matrix, multiplying

568
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:27,670
by its transpose produce
something that's positive?

569
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,520
Can you see any reason
why that quantity,

570
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,930
which looks kind
of messy, I just

571
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:37,530
want to look at it
the right way to see

572
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:41,510
why that should be positive,
that should come out positive.

573
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,820
So I'm not going to
get into numbers,

574
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,640
I'm not going to get into
diagonals and off-diagonals.

575
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,260
I'm just going to do
one thing to understand

576
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,990
that particular combination,
x transpose A transpose Ax.

577
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,870
What shall I do?

578
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:06,130
Anybody see what I might do?

579
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,190
Yeah, you're seeing here
if you look at it again,

580
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,210
what are you seeing here?

581
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,220
Tell me again.

582
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:20,500
If I take Ax together,
then what's the other half?

583
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,090
It's the transpose of Ax.

584
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,900
So I just want to write
that as, I just want

585
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,000
to think of it that way, as Ax.

586
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,270
And here's the transpose of Ax.

587
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,040
Right?

588
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,050
Because transposes
of Ax, so transpose

589
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:39,890
guys in the opposite order,
and the multiplication--

590
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,230
This is the great.

591
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,380
I call these proof
by parenthesis

592
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,150
because I'm just putting
parentheses in the right place,

593
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:53,940
but the key law of
matrix multiplication

594
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,920
is that, that I can put
(AB)C is the same as A(BC).

595
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,810


596
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,170
That rule, which is
just multiply it out

597
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,150
and you see that
parentheses are not

598
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,430
needed because if you keep
them in the right order

599
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,300
you can do this first,
or you can do this first.

600
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,720
Same answer.

601
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,480
What do I learn from that?

602
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,020
What was the point?

603
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,510
This is some vector, I don't
know especially what it is,

604
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,900
times its transpose.

605
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,910
So that's the length squared.

606
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,210
What's the key fact about that?

607
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,000
That it is never negative.

608
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:41,070
It's always greater than
zero or possibly equal.

609
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:44,280
When does that
quantity equal zero?

610
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,580
When Ax is zero.

611
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,060
When Ax is zero.

612
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,050
Because this is a vector.

613
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,830
That's the same
vector transposed.

614
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,500
And everybody's
got that picture.

615
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,970
When I take any y
transpose y, I get

616
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:00,440
y_1 squared plus y_2
squared through y_n squared.

617
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,450
And I get a positive answer
except if the vector is zero.

618
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:11,720
So it's zero when Ax is zero.

619
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,990
So that's going to be the key.

620
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,680
If I pick any matrix
A, and I can just

621
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,670
take an example, but
chapter-- the applications

622
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,730
are just going to
be full of examples.

623
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:29,110
Where the problem begins
with a matrix A and then

624
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:34,960
A transpose shows up and it's
the combination A transpose A

625
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,100
that we work with.

626
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,150
And we're just learning
that it's positive definite.

627
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:46,440
Unless, shall I just hang
on since I've got here,

628
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:53,470
I have to say when is it, have
to get these two possibilities.

629
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,950
Positive definite or
only semi-definite.

630
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:05,820
So what's the key to
that borderline question?

631
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,680
This thing will be
only semi-definite

632
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,270
if there's a solution to Ax=0.

633
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:16,000


634
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,560
If there is an x, well,
there's always the zero vector.

635
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,730
Zero vector I can't
expect to be positive.

636
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:31,300
So I'm looking for
if there's an x so

637
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:42,130
that Ax is zero
but x is not zero,

638
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:48,420
then I'll only be semi-definite.

639
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,320
That's the test.

640
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,730
If there is a solution to Ax=0.

641
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,420


642
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,320
When we see applications
that'll mean

643
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,110
there's a displacement
with no stretching.

644
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:09,580
We might have a line
of springs and when

645
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:16,570
could the line of springs
displace with no stretching?

646
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,390
When it's free-free, right?

647
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:24,010
If I have a line of springs
and no supports at the ends,

648
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,860
then that would be the case
where it could shift over

649
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,350
by the [1, 1, 1] vector.

650
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:33,230
So that would be the case where
the matrix is only singular.

651
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,410
We know that.

652
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,440
The matrix is now
positive semi-definite.

653
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,880
We just learned that.

654
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,330
So the free-free
matrix, like B, both

655
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:48,690
ends free, or C.
So our answer is

656
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:56,170
going to be that K and
T are positive definite.

657
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,470
And our other two guys, the
singular ones, of course,

658
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,590
just don't make it.

659
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:04,000
B at both ends, the
free-free line of springs,

660
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,040
it can shift without stretching.

661
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,810
Since Ax will measure the
stretching when it just

662
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,630
shifts rigid motion,
the Ax is zero

663
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,110
and we see only
positive definite.

664
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,030
And also C, the circular one.

665
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,460
There it can displace
with no stretching

666
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,360
because it can just
turn in the circle.

667
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:45,220
So these guys will be only
positive semi-definite.

668
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,340
Maybe I better say
this another way.

669
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,790
When is this positive definite?

670
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,930
Can I use just a
different sentence

671
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,270
to describe this possibility?

672
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:03,830
This is positive
definite provided,

673
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:08,270
so what I'm going to write now
is to remove this possibility

674
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,140
and get positive definite.

675
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:16,010
This is positive
definite provided, now,

676
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,490
I could say it this way.

677
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:25,130
The A has independent columns.

678
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:29,080
So I just needed to give you
another way of looking at this

679
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,400
Ax=0 question.

680
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,220
If A has independent
columns, what does that mean?

681
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,920
That means that the only
solution to Ax=0 is the zero

682
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,800
solution.

683
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,640
In other words, it means that
this thing works perfectly

684
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,520
and gives me positive.

685
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,080
When A has independent columns.

686
00:42:53,080 --> 00:43:05,470
Let's just remember our K,
T, B, C. So here's a matrix,

687
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:11,150
so let me take the T matrix,
that's this one, this guy.

688
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,600
And then the third
column is [0,  -1, 2].

689
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,960
Those three columns
are independent.

690
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,250
They point off.

691
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,110
They don't lie in a plane.

692
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:27,140
They point off in three
different directions.

693
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:34,820
And then there are no solutions
to, no x's that go Kx=0.

694
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:39,140


695
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,840
So that would be a case
of independent columns.

696
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,000
Let me make a case
of dependent columns.

697
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,730
So, and I'm going
to make it B now.

698
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:51,750
Now the columns of that
matrix are dependent.

699
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,280
There's a combination
of them that give zero.

700
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,530
They all lie in the same plane.

701
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:00,210
There's a solution to that
matrix times x equal zero.

702
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,440
What combination
of those columns

703
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,850
shows me that they
are dependent?

704
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,000
That some combination
of those three columns,

705
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,880
some amount of this
plus some amount

706
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,630
of this plus some
amount of that column

707
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,350
gives me the zero vector.

708
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,600
You see the combination.

709
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,550
What should I take?
[1, 1, 1] again.

710
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,300
No surprise.

711
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,050
That's the vector
[1, 1, 1] that we

712
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:29,840
know is in the-- everything
shifting the same amount,

713
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:36,680
nothing stretching.

714
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,430
Talking fast here about
positive definite matrices.

715
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,360
This is the key.

716
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,980
Let's just ask a few questions
about positive definite

717
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:49,510
matrices as a way to practice.

718
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,940
Suppose I had one.

719
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,560
Positive definite.

720
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,390
What about its inverse?

721
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:02,340
Is that positive
definite or not?

722
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,160
So I've got a positive definite
one, it's not singular,

723
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,990
it's got positive
eigenvalues, everything else.

724
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:14,240
It's inverse will
be symmetric, so I'm

725
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,330
allowed to think about it.

726
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:20,530
Will it be positive definite?

727
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:23,670
What do you think?

728
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,000
Well, you've got a
whole bunch of tests

729
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,090
to sort of mentally run through.

730
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:35,580
Pivots of the inverse, you
don't want to touch that stuff.

731
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,690
Determinants, no.

732
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:39,230
What about eigenvalues?

733
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,090
What would be the
eigenvalues if I

734
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:43,640
have this positive
definite symmetric matrix,

735
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,800
its eigenvalues are
one, four, five.

736
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,700
What can you tell me
about the eigenvalues

737
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,030
of the inverse matrix?

738
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,080
They're the inverses.

739
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,690
So those three eigenvalues are?

740
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:00,890
1, 1/4, 1/5, what's
the conclusion here?

741
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:02,080
It is positive definite.

742
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,430
Those are all positive,
it is positive definite.

743
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:07,940
So if I invert a
positive definite matrix,

744
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,350
I'm still positive definite.

745
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:13,660
All the tests
would have to pass.

746
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,720
It's just I'm looking each
time for the easiest test.

747
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,380
Let me look now, for the
easiest test on K_1+K_2.

748
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,470


749
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:29,980
Suppose that's positive definite
and that's positive definite.

750
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,670
What if I add them?

751
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,940
What do you think?

752
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,680
Well, we hope so.

753
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,840
But we have to say which of
my one, two, three, four, five

754
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,660
would be a good way to see it.

755
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,300
Would be a good way to see it.

756
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,830
Good question.

757
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:53,560
Four?

758
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,280
We certainly don't
want to touch pivots

759
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,860
and now we don't want to
touch eigenvalues either.

760
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:03,400
Of course, if number four
works, others will also work.

761
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,650
The eigenvalues will
come out positive.

762
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:08,170
But not too easy to
say what they are.

763
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:14,450
Let's try test number four.

764
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,060
So K_1.

765
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,760


766
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,020
What's the test?

767
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,430
So test number four
tells us that this part,

768
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:28,670
x transpose K_1*x, that that
part is positive, right?

769
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,900
That that part is positive.

770
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,040
If we know that's
positive definite.

771
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,030
Now, about K_2 we also know
that for every x, you see it's

772
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,720
for every x, that helps.

773
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,900
Don't let me put x_2 there.

774
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:47,670
For every x, this
will be positive.

775
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:52,670
And now what's the
step I want to take?

776
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:57,030
To get some information
on the matrix K_1+K_2.

777
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:59,590


778
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,280
I should add.

779
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,330
If I add these guys, you
see that it just, then I

780
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:14,160
can write that as, I
can write that this way.

781
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,650
And what have I learned?

782
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:19,890
I've learned that that's
positive, even greater than,

783
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:21,680
except for the zero vector.

784
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,930
Because this was greater
than, this is greater than.

785
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:27,170
If I add two positive numbers,
the energies are positive

786
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,380
and the energies just add.

787
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:34,660
The energies just add.

788
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:40,170
So that definition four was the
good way, just nice, easy way

789
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:44,960
to see that if I have a couple
of positive definite matrices,

790
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,020
a couple of positive
energies, I'm really

791
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,570
coupling the two systems.

792
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:53,030
This is associated somehow.

793
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,190
I've got two systems,
I'm putting them together

794
00:48:55,190 --> 00:49:00,260
and the energy is just
even more positive.

795
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:05,860
It's more positive either of
these guys because I'm adding.

796
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,070
As I'm speaking
here, will you allow

797
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:14,870
me to try test number five,
this A transpose A business?

798
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:21,271
Suppose K_1 was A transpose
A. If it's positive definite,

799
00:49:21,271 --> 00:49:21,770
it will.

800
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:31,190
Be And suppose K_2
is B transpose B.

801
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,280
If it's positive
definite, it will be.

802
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:41,390
Now I would like to
write the sum somehow as,

803
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:43,990
in this something
transpose something.

804
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:46,220
And I just do it
now because I think

805
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:50,020
it's like, you won't perhaps
have thought of this way

806
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,000
to do it.

807
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,070
Watch.

808
00:49:56,070 --> 00:50:01,830
Suppose I create
the matrix [A;  B].

809
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,210
That'll be my new matrix.

810
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:11,100
Say, call it C. Am I
allowed to do that?

811
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,210
I mean, that creates a matrix?

812
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:18,110
These A and B, they had the
same number of columns, n.

813
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:20,300
So I can put one over
the other and I still

814
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,370
have something with n columns.

815
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:26,800
So that's my new matrix C.
And now I want C transpose.

816
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,490
By the way, I'd call
that a block matrix.

817
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:35,990
You know, instead of numbers,
it's got two blocks in there.

818
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,980
Block matrices are really handy.

819
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:43,310
Now what's the transpose
of that block matrix?

820
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:47,490
You just have faith, just
have faith with blocks.

821
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:48,880
It's just like numbers.

822
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:55,970
If I had a matrix [1; 5]
then I'd get a row one, five.

823
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,810
But what do you think?

824
00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:01,270
This is worth thinking
about even after class.

825
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:05,470
What would be, if this C
matrix is this block A above B,

826
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,870
what do you think
for C transpose?

827
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:11,510
A transpose, B
transpose side by side.

828
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:15,720
Just put in numbers
and you'd see it.

829
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,990
And now I'm going
to take C transpose

830
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:23,880
times C. I'm calling
it C now instead of A

831
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,360
because I've used the
A in the first guy

832
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:31,780
and I've used B in the second
one and now I'm ready for C.

833
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:35,490
How do you multiply
block matrices?

834
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,980
Again, you just have faith.

835
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,750
What do you think?

836
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,820
Tell me the answer.

837
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,880
A transpose, I
multiply that by that

838
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,180
just as if they were numbers.

839
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:52,020
And I add that times that
just as if they were numbers.

840
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:55,072
And what do I have?

841
00:51:55,072 --> 00:51:55,780
I've got K_1+K_2.

842
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,600


843
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:05,000
So I've written K_1, this is
K_1+K_2 and this is in my form

844
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,080
C transpose C that I was looking
for, that number five was

845
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,860
looking for.

846
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,920
So it's done it.

847
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,660
It's done it.

848
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:19,310
The fact of getting A-- K_1 in
this form, K_2 in this form.

849
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:21,720
And I just made a block
matrix and I got K_1+K_2.

850
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,730


851
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:29,730
That's not a big deal in
itself, but block matrices

852
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,060
are really handy.

853
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:36,260
It's good to take that
step with matrices.

854
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,930
Think of, possibly, the
entries as coming in blocks

855
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:42,600
and not just one at a time.

856
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,330
Well, thank you, okay.

857
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:50,700
I swear Friday we'll
