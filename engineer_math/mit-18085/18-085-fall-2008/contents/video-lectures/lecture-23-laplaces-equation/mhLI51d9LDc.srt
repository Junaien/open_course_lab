9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,590
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK.

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,430
So this is a fun lecture.

11
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,640
This is the lecture
where understanding

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,460
the gradient, which
we did last time;

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,250
the divergence, that
we almost completed;

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,630
those two pieces
now come together

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,870
into Laplace's equation.

16
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,150
Things work in a fantastic
way, so I enjoy this one.

17
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:47,440
So the result will be that we
have the potential function

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,910
u that we've spoken about,
and take its gradient.

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,580
Now is coming a stream
function, s, that's

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,460
connected with the divergence.

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,220
When the divergence
is zero, there's

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,510
something called a
stream function, s.

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,540
And these, the connections
between those two functions, u

24
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,730
and s, are crucial.

25
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,810
And connecting
gradient to divergence

26
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,620
will take us to
Laplace's equation.

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:25,460
And then you'll see the special,
special role of x+iy in 2-D.

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,680
So this is in two dimensions.

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,270
OK.

30
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,290
So let me begin with divergence.

31
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,460
This is the divergence
of w, of course.

32
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,030
And solve it.

33
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,700
Just as we wanted to solve
Kirchhoff's current law,

34
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,840
A transpose w equal zero, so
now in the continuous case,

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,710
we want to find solutions to --
we want to find divergence-free

36
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,580
fields.

37
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,100
Source-free fields,
you could say.

38
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,720
That's about the
best word we have,

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,020
divergence-free, meaning
there is no divergence.

40
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,960
So what have we got here?

41
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,070
We've got one equation
in two unknowns.

42
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,170
Last time, with the
gradient business,

43
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,180
we had two equations for u,
and only that one unknown.

44
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,870
Now we've got one equation,
two unknowns, because we're

45
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,400
looking at the transpose.

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,040
So there should be
a lot of solutions.

47
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,370
Right?

48
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,750
If you give me a
w_1, then probably

49
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,830
I'll be able to find a w_2.

50
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,210
But there's a neat way
to describe the solutions

51
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,280
to that equation, the
divergence-free fields.

52
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,550
It's to introduce something
called a source function --

53
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,980
a stream function,
sorry, stream function.

54
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:53,640
OK, and now the idea will be
that if I let -- let me try.

55
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,860
I take any function s(x,y),
any function whatever.

56
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:04,920
So now I try --
let w_1 be ds/dy.

57
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,050


58
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:14,560
Maybe I should say, maybe
I should go this way.

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,420
I'm looking for solutions.

60
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,970
OK.

61
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:23,010
So I take any function s, I
take its y derivative to be w_1.

62
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,340
And you can tell me
what w_2 has to be?

63
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,280
So if w_1 is ds/dy,
this will be what?

64
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,260
This'll be the second -- the x
derivative of the y derivative.

65
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,480
Right?

66
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,590
If w_1 is the y derivative, then
when I take the x derivative,

67
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,470
I've got this cross derivative.

68
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,040
So what would be the
smart choice for w_2?

69
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,510
So I'll say then,
then w_2 will be --

70
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,720
now I've sort of
said what w_1 is,

71
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,230
what's the w_2
that goes with it?

72
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,840
Well, it's whatever it
takes to cancel this.

73
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,530
I want this to be, in other
words I want it to get zero,

74
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,050
so this should be the
second derivative s.

75
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,400
And what am I going
to put now? dydx.

76
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,510
I'm using the same
very crucial fact

77
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,420
that the cross derivative
can be in either order.

78
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,770
So what do I see for w_2?

79
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,230
Do you see what w_2 is?

80
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,610
This is supposed to match that.

81
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,610
There's a minus
sign. w_2 is what?

82
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,650
Minus ds/dx.

83
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,260


84
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,760
Right?

85
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,320
Minus ds/dx.

86
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,060
That's the minus ds/dx.

87
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,250
If I take any function s, I
let w_1 be its y derivative

88
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,890
and w_2 be minus
its x derivative,

89
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,030
then the divergence
will be zero.

90
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,550
Because I'll have
the cross derivative

91
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,400
minus the cross derivative,
of course that'll be zero.

92
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,720
So these will be my w_1's -- my
w's. w_1, w_2, coming from s.

93
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,300
So I have what I expect,
with two unknowns,

94
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,090
only one equation, I've
got lots of solutions.

95
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,950
I create any function
s, and that will be one.

96
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,570
So that's a stream function.

97
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,640
And it has a physical
meaning, so we get to see it.

98
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,000
And it has a fantastic
connection to the potential.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,830
So up to now -- so this is
now the moment pieces come

100
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,370
together.

101
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,470
Up to now, we had the divergence
and the gradient separately.

102
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,680
So up to now, what we had was,
we started with the potential

103
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:49,375
u, and we went to v -- I called
it v for this application --

104
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,000
[du/dx, du/dy].

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,010


106
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,890
OK.

107
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,590
And now, over on this side,
I had the divergence of w

108
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,230
equals zero.

109
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:08,670
And that led me to w being,
what we just said, ds/dy,

110
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,710
and minus ds/dx.

111
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,220
OK, two separate pictures.

112
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,480
Now we're going to
connect the framework,

113
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,160
going to give the
connection between v and w.

114
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,560
And the connection will
be the easiest possible;

115
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,820
they'll be equal.

116
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,870
So the c in our framework
is the identity.

117
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,290
I want to say, I want
to look at our framework

118
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,830
when c is the identity.

119
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,070
So v and w are the same.

120
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,730
In other words, what
equation do we get then?

121
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,440
We started with u,
we take the gradient

122
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,760
of u, that's v. We go
over here, and we still

123
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,720
have the gradient of u,
because this was the v

124
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,770
and now it's also the w.

125
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,160
And then we take
-- what do we take?

126
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,390
Minus the divergence of
the gradient of u, equals,

127
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,510
let's say, f.

128
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,740
Shall we say f, to
make something happen?

129
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,570
Or zero -- I'll say zero.

130
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,300
I'll say zero.

131
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,330
Yeah, because zero
is the one that

132
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,490
give us Laplace's equation.

133
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,200
The official name would be
-- that's Laplace's equation.

134
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,120
Do you recognize it?

135
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,980
We'd better write
it out properly.

136
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,970
The divergence of the
gradient is the Laplacian.

137
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,600
So this is Laplace.

138
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,560
Famous equation.

139
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,510
Steady-state type of equation.

140
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,630
It goes with
steady-state problems.

141
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,950
Let's just figure
out what this is.

142
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:55,420
So w is, since these are the
same, w is now [du/dx, du/dy].

143
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,690
It's the gradient.

144
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,200
Now what happens,
do you see what

145
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,290
happens when I take the
divergence of the gradient,

146
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:07,210
the divergence of this w?

147
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,390
I just want to write
that equation out.

148
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,460
It's crucial.

149
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,200
I need brilliant colors
and lights shining, now,

150
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,460
for what goes in there.

151
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,100
Because I want to take the
divergence of the gradient.

152
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,320
So what does that mean?

153
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,460
I take the x derivative
of the first component,

154
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,190
plus the y derivative
of the second component.

155
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,530
The minus sign is not going
to matter, with a zero

156
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,140
on the right hand side.

157
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,850
I could cancel the minus.

158
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,700
So, but let me say it again.

159
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,120
The divergence is, it applies
to a vector, I've got a vector.

160
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,940
I take the x component
of the first -- of w_1.

161
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,100
So that'll give me d
second u/dx squared.

162
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,230
And I take the y derivative --
I should have said derivative --

163
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,340
y derivative of the
second component.

164
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:05,570
And the y derivative of that
is d second u/dy squared.

165
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,030
And I get zero.

166
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,330
So that's Laplace's equation.

167
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,200
You see, the whole idea
is Laplace's equation,

168
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,300
in working with
Laplace's equation,

169
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,930
we have three elements, here.

170
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,430
The gradient comes in,
the divergence comes in,

171
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,840
and equality comes in.

172
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,230
Would you like to see a more
general Laplace's equation?

173
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,610
Well, a more general
Poisson's equation.

174
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:43,080
So underneath Laplace,
let me write Poisson.

175
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,440
You got the pronunciation, the
brilliant French pronunciation

176
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,080
there, of Poisson?

177
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,130
That was my best.

178
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,620
I can't improve on that one.

179
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,730
So it comes in when
there's a right-hand side.

180
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,920
So the normal Poisson equation
is second derivative with

181
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,680
respect to x, second derivative
with respect to y -- well,

182
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,260
actually, it should
have a minus there.

183
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,050
Really should be a minus there.

184
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,090
You remember why
the minus is there.

185
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,840
The minus is there to make
the whole thing positive.

186
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,340
Right?

187
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,190
That sounds crazy, that the
minus makes it positive.

188
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,790
But these second derivatives are
negative definite, as always,

189
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,370
and the minus makes
them positive definite.

190
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:32,350
So I don't remember whether --
maybe I often include the minus

191
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,770
over here -- equal f(x,y).

192
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,920
So there's a source.

193
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,740
Poisson has a source term.

194
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,950
Laplace doesn't.

195
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,760
And just while I'm talking
about this framework,

196
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,800
if there was a c(x,y),
so this would be or.

197
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,980
I'll put or.

198
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,450
The more general one
would be the x derivative,

199
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:03,410
because I'm taking the
divergence, of a c(x,y)du/dx,

200
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,140
and the y derivative of a c
-- so you see the difference.

201
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,130
I'm now allowing some
variable conductivity.

202
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:18,010
Variable whatever,
variable material.

203
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,490
du/dy equals f, again.

204
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,470
So that would be the
more general one.

205
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,290
I don't think we
plan to study that.

206
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,280
Well, that's not
the most general,

207
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,110
I could have more and
more things there.

208
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,880
But that shows you
a variable material.

209
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,180
Yeah, that material is variable.

210
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,130
I would use the word --
what word would I use?

211
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,600
It doesn't depend
on the direction.

212
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,760
I'm using the same c(x,y)
in the x direction and the y

213
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,880
direction.

214
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,390
Therefore in all directions.

215
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,820
And I didn't come
prepared with that word.

216
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,290
What's the word
for when it doesn't

217
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,890
depend on the direction?

218
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,740
Isotropic!

219
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,340
Thanks.

220
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,330
Isotropic.

221
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,320
So that's isotropic.

222
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,230
So that's really
our framework there.

223
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,110
At least for
isotropic materials.

224
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,640
And then we could
have more general

225
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,950
with anisotropic materials.

226
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,290
That would be fun.

227
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,190
All of those things are fun.

228
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,280
But Laplace's equation
is the most fun of all.

229
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,280
So let me take f to
be zero, c to be one,

230
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,050
get back up to
Laplace's equation,

231
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,780
and begin to make connections.

232
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,200
Begin to make connections.

233
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,590
OK.

234
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,750
The beautiful connection
is the one right here.

235
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,640
When v and u are the same,
when v and w are the same,

236
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,370
then I just read off.

237
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,730
If v is the same as w, then
how is the potential function,

238
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,810
which is on the left side,
connected to the strain

239
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,690
function, which is coming
from, any time div w is zero,

240
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,660
I've got a stream
function in 2-D, here.

241
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,130
The connection is
just, those two match.

242
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:14,890
du/dx is the same
as ds/dy, and du/dy

243
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,750
is the same as minus ds/dx.

244
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:22,970
You see that the two sides of
our world are coming together.

245
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:28,080
We're dealing with flows
that are both gradient flows,

246
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,170
they come from a
potential, you could often

247
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:38,000
say potential flows, I see the
word ideal flows coming in.

248
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,300
These are very special flows.

249
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,770
So aero couldn't work entirely
with these flows, of course.

250
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,700
These are such ideal flows.

251
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,760
Proper aerodynamics,
you've got shocks,

252
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,650
you've got all sorts
of stuff going on.

253
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,810
But in a region where
everything's beautiful,

254
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:04,430
then you get back to this,
total steady state, steady flow,

255
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,340
steady potential flow.

256
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,240
We've got those
equations that connect u

257
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,130
on one side with the
divergence business,

258
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,330
the stream function
on the other side.

259
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,710
So I want to focus on these.

260
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,700
Actually, I mean, so the
heart of Laplace's equation

261
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,680
is in there.

262
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,280
OK.

263
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,522
First, do you know the
names of those two guys?

264
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:31,980
I shouldn't call
them guys, they're

265
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,820
the greatest
mathematicians ever.

266
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,530
Maybe after Gauss.

267
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,020
Do you know whose names are
associated with those two

268
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,530
equations?

269
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,140
Well, Lagrange was great.

270
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,300
I'm not saying anything
about Lagrange.

271
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,220
But he didn't do this.

272
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,910
So two, one French
and one German.

273
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:00,070
So the French guy's
name is Cauchy.

274
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,260
And the German is --
so these are Cauchy,

275
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,770
and the German is a
really fantastic guy.

276
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,520
Anybody know his name?

277
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,450
Cauchy-Riemann.

278
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:11,950
Yeah.

279
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,320
The other name is Riemann.

280
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:21,170
Cauchy-Riemann equations,
that connect the two pieces,

281
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,180
u and s.

282
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,660
And they're the subject
of an enormous theory

283
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,110
that we'll just touch on here.

284
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,820
OK.

285
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,140
And we'll see them graphically,
and we'll find solutions.

286
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,720
So this is one way
to pose our problem.

287
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,890
Notice something here.

288
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,250
I think that if we
have these equations,

289
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,130
a solution u should
satisfy Laplace's equation.

290
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,460
Because this equality will
take us around the loop.

291
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,240
So do you see that if I
could solve these two --

292
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,740
here's the point.

293
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,470
I'm going to get Laplace's
equation solved by u.

294
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,630
Laplace's equation will
also be solved by s.

295
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,540
The stream function.

296
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,160
So what's going to happen
is, I get two solutions.

297
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,100
A pair of solutions.

298
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:17,870
Laplace's equation, solutions
to that come in pairs, u and s.

299
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,800
So we get them two at a time.

300
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,680
And they're connected
in this remarkable way.

301
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,470
Let's see, can you see
that u will satisfy --

302
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,140
this is the key to everything.

303
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,681
Does u satisfy
Laplace's equation?

304
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:31,180
Sure.

305
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,660
I take the x derivative
of that, and I add

306
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,760
to the y derivative of that.

307
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,990
Do you see, it works.

308
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,450
The x derivative of this,
plus the y derivative of this

309
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,890
is exactly the cancellation
of the cross that I wanted.

310
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:51,860
So I do these, I combine
those into Laplace.

311
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,760
Shall I just go through
that verbally again?

312
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,280
I take the x derivative
of this, which gives me

313
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,620
the cross derivative of s.

314
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,260
This asked me to take
the y derivative,

315
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,150
so I get the cross
derivative again.

316
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,240
With the minus sign,
they add to zero.

317
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,530
I just want to point
out that also, s

318
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,690
satisfies Laplace's equation.

319
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:20,960
Can we do that one?

320
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,090
I claim that also,
the stream function

321
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,510
solves Laplace's equation.

322
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,940
Because we want the x
derivative of ds/dx.

323
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,470
So ds/dx is minus this.

324
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,790
Do you see what's happening?

325
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,480
When I take the x
derivative of ds/dx,

326
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,200
I get minus the cross
derivative of u for this guy.

327
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,430
It's the y derivative
of this, which is

328
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,540
plus the cross derivative of u.

329
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,890
They cancel.

330
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,350
So u and s are just together.

331
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,350
Oh, let's find some solutions.

332
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,900
They're great to find.

333
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,770
And then draw them.

334
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:03,290
OK, can I find some solutions
to Laplace's equation.

335
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,900
And I'm going to
find them in pairs.

336
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,970
So I'm going to have a list
of u's and their corresponding

337
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,840
s's.

338
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,110
OK.

339
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,210
These are solutions to Laplace.

340
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,400
These are, solve
Laplace's equation.

341
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,000
So we've got Laplace's
equation in our minds.

342
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,599
Actually, furthermore,
they solve Cauchy-Riemann.

343
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,140
Because they're
going to be connected

344
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,120
by our Cauchy-Riemann equation.

345
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,130
So, solve Laplace
and Cauchy-Riemann.

346
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,120
OK.

347
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,650
Suppose I take u(x,y)=x.

348
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,820


349
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,290
I'm going to start
with an easy solution.

350
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,320
That certainly solves
Laplace's equation.

351
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,080
You've got Laplace's
equation in mind?

352
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,611
Let me write it up here again.

353
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:56,110
u_xx+u_yy=0.

354
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,060


355
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,030
I take the chance
to write it again,

356
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,340
to do it in this little
bit shorter notation,

357
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,680
just subscripts
instead of partials.

358
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,800
And also, s_xx+s_yy=0.

359
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,730


360
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:18,980
But most of all,
the Cauchy-Riemann

361
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,220
that connects the two.

362
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,880
Well, does u=x solve
Laplace's equation?

363
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,490
Of course it does.

364
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,640
The second x derivative, if
the function is x, is zero.

365
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,540
And the second y derivative
is very, very zero.

366
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,400
[LAUGHTER] So what's s?

367
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,260
What's the s that goes with it?

368
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,400
It'll be simple, too.

369
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,220
So the s -- so u is x, right?

370
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,670
I'm starting with this x.

371
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,160
So du/dx is one.

372
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,570
So what do you figure s is?

373
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,670
If du/dx -- see, u is just x
itself, so du/dx is only a one.

374
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,180
That derivative was easy.

375
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,620
Then ds/dy is
supposed to be one,

376
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,590
and ds/dx is supposed
to be zero, I guess.

377
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,380
Do you see what s is? y.

378
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,750
S is y. s is y.

379
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,310
Of course, that solves
Laplace's equation, too,

380
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,890
and it solves Cauchy-Riemann.

381
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,030
The x derivative of this is
the y derivative of that.

382
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,390
One equal one.

383
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,550
And the y derivative of that
is minus the x derivative

384
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,480
of that, zero equal zero.

385
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,350
OK, so that's an easy one.

386
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,620
I'm going to go up a level.

387
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,870
I want to take a second degree.

388
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,890
So my next guy in the
list will be -- a pair,

389
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:48,210
it's a list of pairs -- will
be x squared minus y squared.

390
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,500
First of all, it better
not be in that list

391
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,320
unless it solves
Laplace's equation.

392
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,080
And then if it is,
we'll find an s.

393
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,700
So plug it in mentally,
can you plug this

394
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,180
into Laplace's equation?

395
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,200
What's the second x
derivative of this function?

396
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,720
Two.

397
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,300
Right? xx brings down a two.

398
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,300
What's the second y derivative?

399
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,270
Minus two, from this term.

400
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:19,111
And then put them into Laplace's
equation, two minus two.

401
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:19,610
Correct.

402
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,430
Zero.

403
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,560
All right.

404
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,070
Now I'm looking for the
s that goes with it.

405
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,160
The other one in the pair.

406
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,490
OK, maybe I'd better
think through what --

407
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:37,180
so this is supposed to
give me the s, du/dx --

408
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:45,130
let me copy Cauchy-Riemann here,
so we can just focus entirely

409
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,440
on that board.

410
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:54,780
So du/dx, this is 2x in my
example. du/dy is minus 2y.

411
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,370
So what am I learning?
ds/dy should be 2x.

412
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,500
ds/dx should be 2y.

413
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,600
There are minus
signs on both there.

414
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,180
What's s?

415
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,220
Do you see s?

416
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,660
The y derivative is 2x,
the x derivative is 2y,

417
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:21,851
and that stream function is 2xy.

418
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:22,350
Right?

419
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,650
2xy.

420
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,100
Because the x derivative
of this is 2y,

421
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,230
and the y derivative
of this is 2x.

422
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,520
And we saw 2xy last time also.

423
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,940
And of course, it solves
Laplace's equation easily.

424
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,040
Plug that in, the second
derivative is zero.

425
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,640
The second x derivative is
zero, second y derivative

426
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,630
is zero, everything.

427
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,480
So that's a pair.

428
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,560
This is a nice pair.

429
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,240
You want to shoot
for third degree?

430
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,510
We could maybe figure out third
degree, just by jiggling it.

431
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,950
After that, we're
going to need an idea

432
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,860
to get up to fourth degree.

433
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,310
Let me try third degree.

434
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,100
Cubics, now.

435
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,470
So I'm looking -- first I just
want to get somebody here.

436
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,260
So it's some x cubed.

437
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,110
And then I'm going to need some
more stuff, because x cubed

438
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,360
by itself certainly won't work.

439
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,260
I need something more.

440
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,820
And I want to plug it
into Laplace's equation

441
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,670
and figure out
what should it be?

442
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,590
OK, so when I plug this
into Laplace's equation,

443
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,710
what do I get?

444
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,240
Let me do Laplace's
equation over here,

445
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:51,270
to try to get the
u of degree three.

446
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:56,260
So what's u_xx, so far?

447
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,930
6x, right?

448
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,040
Bring down, we've got 3x
squared, then we get 6x,

449
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,350
so I've got a 6x.

450
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:09,010
And I'm looking for -- so u_yy
should be minus 6x to cancel

451
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,160
that.

452
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,530
So what do I want there?

453
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,190
What do I need?

454
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,420
I need a minus,
I'm sure of that.

455
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:25,370
So the second y derivative
should be this 6x deal.

456
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,110
What do I want?

457
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,550
3xy squared?

458
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,800
That sounds good.

459
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,250
Let me write it down
and see if it is good.

460
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:34,940
OK.

461
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,230
The second y derivative.

462
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,140
Yes.

463
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,730
We'll bring down a two, and
then the y's will disappear

464
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,560
and I'll have the minus 6x.

465
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,430
Golden.

466
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,380
OK, that's great.

467
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,710
That's great.

468
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,820
Is that correct?

469
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,500
I mean, it's great,
but is it right?

470
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,350
Yes.

471
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:52,990
Yes.

472
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,100
OK.

473
00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:01,020
Now, you have faith that
there's another one?

474
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,260
Well, yeah, there
is another one.

475
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,570
Cauchy-Riemann
never let us down.

476
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,630
There will be an s
that'll go with that,

477
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,120
that'll solve a
Cauchy-Riemann equation,

478
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,360
and it'll look like it.

479
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:21,820
And I think, I think -- and I
just sort of reverse x and y

480
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,900
to get another one, because
if I exchange x and y,

481
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,470
I'm still OK with
Laplace's equation.

482
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:35,050
I think something like
3yx squared minus y cubed.

483
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:39,000
If that worked, then this
one should work, too.

484
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,310
Because I just switched
x and y, and I think

485
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,480
it'll work right here.

486
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,450
The second x
derivative will be 6y,

487
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,560
and the second y derivative
will be minus 6y.

488
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,490
I think that's good.

489
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,720
OK.

490
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,470
Let's put this list
on hold for a moment.

491
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,990
Something's -- obviously,
there's some pattern here that

492
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,380
we've got to locate.

493
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,230
Can I put it on
hold for a moment

494
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,990
and take, for example,
the graph of this one.

495
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,140
And I want to draw the pictures.

496
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,020
Before I get a
complete list, I want

497
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,470
to draw the pictures
of these functions.

498
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,300
And what do I mean by pictures?

499
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:31,970
I mean draw the -- so now I'm
taking the u to be x squared

500
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,300
minus y squared,
and the s to be 2xy.

501
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:41,720
And I want to draw those, I
want to draw the vector field

502
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,930
of the gradients of those guys.

503
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:47,820
OK, so this is the u
-- I want to draw --

504
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,300
this is the potential x
squared minus y squared.

505
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,820
So what are they
equipotential curves?

506
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,010
So this is now --
I'm drawing the flow.

507
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,100
And to draw the flow, I draw the
curves on which the potential

508
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,300
is a constant. x squared minus
y squared equal constant.

509
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,230
So what kind of a
curve is x squared

510
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,740
minus y squared equal constant?

511
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,360
It's a hyperbola.

512
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,150
It's a hyperbola.

513
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,430
So x squared minus y squared
equal, let's take one,

514
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,080
for example.

515
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,910
As one constant.

516
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:27,940
So x=1 will be on the
curve, when y is zero.

517
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,640
And then what else
will be on the curve?

518
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:37,620
If x is a little bigger,
like two -- so here's (1, 0).

519
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:42,240
That point is certainly -- x
squared minus y squared is one

520
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,030
for that.

521
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,730
Suppose I go out to x=2.

522
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,770
What should y be then,
to make this right?

523
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,250
Where's the curve going?

524
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,310
When x is two, what is y?

525
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,450
Square root of
three, plus or minus.

526
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,930
So square root of three
is something like this,

527
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,510
up or down.

528
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:09,050
It's a curve, like so.

529
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:14,120
It's a hyperbola.

530
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,350
And now, if I change
c to four, let's say,

531
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:26,200
then it'll go through (2,
0), and it'll go up this way.

532
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:34,700
And if I change x to something
very small, it'll still -- oh,

533
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,880
there's a Greek
word, asymptotes.

534
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,380
Oh, yeah.

535
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,190
What do I get if -- the
asymptote is when this is zero.

536
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,900
Yeah.

537
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,680
When that is zero,
what's my curve?

538
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:54,100
What are x and y?

539
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,610
They'll be the same. x
will be y, or minus y.

540
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:02,100
I'll be on that straight line,
or on this straight line.

541
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,820
So all these other
hyperbolas are

542
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,270
kind of asymptotic,
whatever the word is.

543
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,600
Right, do you see them?

544
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,310
As a bunch of hyperbolas?

545
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:23,330
And actually, more
hyperbolas -- well, yeah.

546
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:27,390
Let's see, back when
I had a one there,

547
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:32,580
I took x and y to be positive,
and I got that hyperbola.

548
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,150
But since I'm
squaring them there,

549
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,470
also these hyperbolas are here.

550
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:46,650
So these same guys are on
that side of the picture.

551
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,850
Those are the equipotentials.

552
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:55,200
So these are the equipotentials.

553
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,240
OK.

554
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:03,500
Now, let me draw s.

555
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,920
So those will be the equi -- no,
I don't want to say equi-stream

556
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,430
functions.

557
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:12,120
That's awkward.

558
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:17,740
So now, I want to draw s equal
constant, like one or whatever.

559
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,320
So I've drawn this with
a whole lot of constants,

560
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,780
and now I want to
draw the other guys.

561
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,730
What do those curves look like?

562
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,380
And what's their name?

563
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,170
A curve on which the stream
function is a constant

564
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,220
has a nice name, streamline.

565
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,940
So now I'm going to
draw the streamlines.

566
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,470
And what are the streamlines?

567
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,640
The streamlines
will be the curves

568
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,400
that the actual material flows.

569
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,630
If you drop a leaf into
this flow, and you watch it,

570
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,070
it'll flow along a streamline.

571
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,010
And we can draw those lines.

572
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,830
So what are those?

573
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:09,060
2xy=1, or the equation y=1/(2x).

574
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,200
That's also a hyperbola, right?

575
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,510
That's also a hyperbola.

576
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:18,260
This is a fantastic
picture, in which

577
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,820
we have two sets of hyperbolas.

578
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,520
We're second degree, that's why
we're getting two hyperbolas.

579
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,650
I'm not going to tackle drawing
-- MATLAB could do it --

580
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,470
drawing the equipotentials and
the streamlines for this guy.

581
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:37,570
Oh, but I'm willing
to tackle this one.

582
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:42,980
What are the equipotentials and
the streamlines for the easiest

583
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,260
one in the list, there?

584
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,530
Can I just draw that one?

585
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,170
Because it makes a point very
clear, that we'll see when

586
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,100
we draw these.

587
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:59,170
Okay, so what's the picture,
the corresponding picture?

588
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,500
Here is the xy-plane again.

589
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,930
What are the equipotentials
for this pair?

590
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,960
And the streamlines.

591
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,340
The equipotentials are x equal
constant, what are those?

592
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,680
Those are lines, vertical lines.

593
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,120
So the equipotentials
are just vertical lines.

594
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,720
Equipotentials, x
equal a constant.

595
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,130
And what are the streamlines?

596
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,450
Horizontal lines.

597
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,240
Streamlines go this way.

598
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,110
And what's the great
point about these?

599
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,610
These are the streamlines,
s equal constant.

600
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,730
And of course, what
do you notice here?

601
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,870
They're perpendicular.

602
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,070
The streamlines
are perpendicular

603
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,400
to the equipotentials.

604
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,520
And why?

605
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,780
It's because -- you
remember we talked about,

606
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,580
what does the gradient mean?

607
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,320
Which way does the
gradient point?

608
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,930
It points perpendicular
to these equipotentials.

609
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:09,590
And in this case, all these
equipotentials are parallel,

610
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,780
and the perpendicular
lines are the streamlines,

611
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,000
and they're all parallel.

612
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,480
Now over here, we haven't
got straight lines.

613
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,260
but we still have
the beautiful figure.

614
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,470
Now I'm ready to tackle it.

615
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,820
I'll draw these curves.

616
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,690
They're hyperbolas, like y=1/2x.

617
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,560
If I just make that y=1/2x.

618
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,780
That's a line that
comes down this way.

619
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,490
Let me try to draw it.

620
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,120
I'll use dashed lines.

621
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,890
Of course, as x gets
bigger, y gets smaller.

622
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:52,990
But y never makes it to
zero, because if y was zero,

623
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,550
no x would work.

624
00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:01,550
But if I change that one to to
a four, I've got a bigger --

625
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,900
this is coming out here.

626
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,390
If I change that to
something very small,

627
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,230
I'll get one that's coming --

628
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:17,200
Do you see how
the picture works?

629
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,670
These are all right angles.

630
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,850
That's the great thing.

631
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,240
Right angles.

632
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,950
90 degree angles.

633
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:31,660
Between the streamlines
and the equipotentials.

634
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,740
You may have seen
this before, and now

635
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,280
I just want to ask you why.

636
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,920
Why are those 90 degrees?

637
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,920
We kind of see it physically,
that the gradient --

638
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,430
the flow is in the
gradient direction.

639
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,750
And we know that
gradients are always

640
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:54,330
perpendicular to
equipotential lines.

641
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:58,990
The gradient of any function
is perpendicular to the level

642
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,440
curves.

643
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,230
That's all we're seeing here.

644
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:08,230
But we're seeing these two
fantastic families of curves.

645
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,060
Equipotentials perpendicular
to the streamline.

646
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,940
And the reason
they're perpendicular

647
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,750
is Cauchy-Riemann.

648
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,130
Cauchy-Riemann is telling
us they're perpendicular.

649
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,610
Because the gradient
-- yeah, you see that

650
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:28,460
they're perpendicular, and this
may be overkill to try to give

651
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,180
a proof.

652
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:39,410
The gradient of u --
what I want to say is,

653
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:43,320
the gradient of u is a 90 degree
rotation of the gradient of s.

654
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,900
Let me put it that way.

655
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:49,920
The gradient of s --
the gradient of u,

656
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,180
rotate 90 degrees, rotate
gradient of u by 90 degrees,

657
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:04,940
pi/2, and you get grad s.

658
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,470
That's what these equations say.

659
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:14,680
That if I take the gradient of u
-- yeah, let me try to do that.

660
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,960
So I take the gradient of u.

661
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,480
That's [du/dx, du/dy].

662
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:25,270
So if I have a vector
in 2-D, [du/dx, du/dy].

663
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:30,500
And I want to rotate a
vector by 90 degrees.

664
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,400
What's the result?

665
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,090
Suppose I have a vector [a, b],
and I'm looking to rotate it.

666
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,960
What's the vector
that goes that way?

667
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,120
If that vector is [a, b],
that vector should be what?

668
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,530
You may not have done this,
but it's worth just noticing,

669
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,530
and you won't forget it.

670
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,140
It's got to have a zero
dot product, right?

671
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,720
So I'm looking for
a vector, here.

672
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,450
This went out a and up b.

673
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,130
I'm looking for a
vector there that's

674
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,350
perpendicular to this vector.

675
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:08,260
So what should it do?

676
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,360
What am I going to put there?

677
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,880
A b.

678
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,330
And what am I going
to put -- oh no.

679
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,480
It went backwards, sorry.

680
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,540
When I put there, I should
have put -- minus b.

681
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,820
And what goes there? a.

682
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,130
Yeah.

683
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,760
That's the perpendicular one.

684
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,920
Right?

685
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,940
That's the 90 degree rotation.

686
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,560
And that's what Cauchy-Riemann
is doing for us.

687
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,490
I take the gradient,
I take this vector.

688
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:42,270
Now I rotate by 90 degrees,
means I reverse these,

689
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,410
reverse the sign, and
I've got the gradient

690
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,400
of S. Or minus
the gradient of S.

691
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,480
I won't say whether
the rotation is plus 90

692
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,110
degrees or minus 90 degrees.

693
00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:05,250
This can remain an exercise
to see it slowly and clearly.

694
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,990
I'm happy if you see it
in the picture there.

695
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:12,740
And of course, you saw
it in this picture, here.

696
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,220
So this is a moment, then,
to take a little pause.

697
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:21,310
Because we've got ten
minutes for the great event.

698
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,700
We've got the general idea.

699
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,400
The u equal constants
and the s equal constant.

700
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,360
These two families of
perpendicular curves,

701
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,560
one telling us where level
sets for the potential,

702
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,060
the other telling us the
direction of the flow.

703
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,680
The flow goes perpendicular
to the level sets.

704
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,250
It's just wonderful.

705
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:50,540
And now I would like to get the
pattern that's going on here

706
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,920
and complete that list.

707
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,910
OK, well that pattern,
like, comes out of the blue,

708
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,500
I have to admit.

709
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,800
You might sort of recognize
it, that something -- here is,

710
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,880
obviously, stuff
to the first power.

711
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,260
Here we've squared
something to get here.

712
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,370
Here we've cubed something.

713
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,380
You sort of recognize
these numbers, 1 3 3 1,

714
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:23,200
or one, minus three, whatever.

715
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,730
We're taking powers
of something.

716
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:31,180
And that something is what
comes out of the blue.

717
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,370
It's this quantity, x+iy.

718
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:39,360


719
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,230
Complex variables.

720
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,210
Everything here was
real until this moment.

721
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,360
And then I'm saying
that the complex number

722
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:52,150
i, the imaginary number i,
the square root of minus one.

723
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:56,790
Which of course, it's
not a real number,

724
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,540
but it has the property,
whenever we see i squared,

725
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,740
we write minus one.

726
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,230
So then, we know
how to deal with it.

727
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,020
OK.

728
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,780
Sort of.

729
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:09,080
Anyway, so that complex
number I'll call z.

730
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,060
And here's what I think.

731
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:19,350
I think that these two
pieces are the real

732
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:24,330
and the imaginary parts of z.

733
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:28,070
Now, these two
pieces are the real

734
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:34,350
and the imaginary
parts of z squared.

735
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:38,210
These two pieces
will be the real part

736
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,040
and the imaginary
part of z cubed.

737
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,360
And if we check
that, and then we

738
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,860
begin to see, why should these
satisfy Laplace's equation,

739
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,790
we'll have the whole pattern.

740
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,601
It'll just be x+iy,
fourth power, fifth power,

741
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:55,100
sixth power.

742
00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:00,720
We can make a complete, infinite
list of pairs of solutions

743
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,620
to Laplace's equation.

744
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:09,050
So let me just check what I
said about the squares first.

745
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,302
How do you do x+iy squared?

746
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,760
Because that's what
I believe we're

747
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,540
seeing in the quadratic list.

748
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:23,800
So I claim that if I take x+iy
squared, just do it normally,

749
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:32,190
I get x squared, and I get 2ixy,
and I get i squared y squared.

750
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,830
Right?

751
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:39,440
I just squared it, following
normal algebra rules.

752
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,560
Now what's the real part?

753
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,980
What's the real part of this
x+iy squared? x squared,

754
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,140
this is real.

755
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,020
And this is real, because
i squared is minus one,

756
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,850
this says minus y
squared, that's our guy.

757
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:01,190
And the imaginary part is 2xy.

758
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:04,220
The imaginary part is the
part that multiplies i.

759
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:13,400
So by some magic -- next time is
the fun of exploring this magic

760
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,570
-- we get solutions
to a real equation.

761
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,360
We get two solutions
to a real equation,

762
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,500
by working with this
complex thing, x+iy,

763
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:30,240
and taking things like -- now,
if I go to x+iy cubed, well,

764
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,340
let me just say it'll work.

765
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:39,670
We'll have -- it's like,
if you cube something,

766
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,920
you're going to see 1 3 3 1.

767
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:52,320
You'll have an x cubed, and a
3x squared iy, and a 3xiy twice,

768
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,360
and a one of the iy cubed.

769
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,010
And then you look to see what
part is real, and you say,

770
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,750
x cubed is real.

771
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:07,240
And i squared is the minus,
so I have minus 3xy squared.

772
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,870
Golden.

773
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,930
And you look for what
part is imaginary,

774
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:15,090
and you see the 3x squared
y, and you see the i cubed --

775
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:19,650
so what's i cubed?
-- is minus i.

776
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:24,650
So that's an imaginary term,
with the minus we wanted.

777
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,720
So now we've got
the whole thing.

778
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,230
We've got solutions
to Laplace's equation,

779
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:37,650
coming from all the powers.

780
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:41,350
This is now the
moment to celebrate.

781
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:45,520
Because we've got a
giant family of solutions

782
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,160
to Laplace's equation.

783
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,690
We've got the real parts.

784
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:57,850
So u is the real part
of x+iy to any power.

785
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:06,420
And s will be the
imaginary part.

786
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,700
And I claim that, just as it
held for n equal one, two,

787
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:15,360
three, for every n,
these will be solutions

788
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,110
to Laplace's equation.

789
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,120
Not only that, they'll be
connected by Cauchy-Riemann,

790
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:31,490
so they'll be the potential and
the stream function for a flow.

791
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:34,640
And we've got lots of them.

792
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,040
And, why don't we get
even more, because we

793
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,730
have a linear equation here.

794
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:44,050
So what are we allowed to
do, if we have solutions

795
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,620
to a linear
equation, what are we

796
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,230
allowed to do with
those solutions

797
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,360
to get more solutions?

798
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,790
Combine them.

799
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:56,500
I can take any
combination of these guys.

800
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,970
I can take "or." "And,"
"or," I don't know which,

801
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:04,140
should I put "or," "and?"

802
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:08,070
The real part of any
combination of these.

803
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:13,160
So I could take a combination
of, I can take coefficients

804
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:22,820
c_k, or c_n, maybe I should
say c_n, (x+iy) to the nth.

805
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,800
So if I take a
combination of solutions,

806
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,760
with coefficient c_n,
I still have solutions.

807
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:38,410
And what will be the twin
solution, or the stream

808
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:40,670
function that goes with this u?

809
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:45,850
So this is another u, this is
virtually a complete family

810
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,980
of u.

811
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,070
Because we have all these
coefficients to choose.

812
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,410
And what will be the s?

813
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,360
So what's the
corresponding s, then?

814
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:02,940
It's the imaginary part of
-- what? -- the same thing.

815
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:10,190
We're just taking
that same combination

816
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,840
of the special ones.

817
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,030
So the special
ones were (x+iy)^n.

818
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,910
And the combinations are those.

819
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,510
Yeah.

820
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,600
These are fantastic solutions.

821
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,840
And now, since I'm blessed
with two more minutes,

822
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:29,460
I get to make them much easier.

823
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,320
Because already when I got
up to x cubed and y cubed,

824
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,150
they're looking messy.

825
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,300
You say, okay, great to
have all these solutions,

826
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,560
but how am I going to use them?

827
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,250
They're getting more and more
complicated as n increases.

828
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:49,160
But switch to polar coordinates.

829
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,060
Make the same list
in polar coordinates.

830
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,850
So again, I'm just going
to list the same guys

831
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:02,505
in polar coordinates r, theta.

832
00:47:02,505 --> 00:47:03,880
Then you'll see
the pattern, then

833
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,660
the pattern really jumps out.

834
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:10,500
So what is x in
polar coordinates?

835
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,620
If I switch from x, y,
rectangular coordinates, to r,

836
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:20,330
theta, polar coordinates,
x is r*cos(theta).

837
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:25,510
And y is r*sin(theta).

838
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:30,360
Well, so far it doesn't look
any easier. x and y look fine.

839
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:36,290
But let me go to the second one.

840
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:41,180
So this is now r squared
cos squared theta, right?

841
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:48,000
Minus, this is r squared
sine squared theta.

842
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,590
Trigonometry comes in.

843
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,520
I have r squared
cos squared theta,

844
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,580
minus r squared sine squared
theta, I want to simplify that.

845
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:02,230
So it's got an r
squared, and it's got

846
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,910
a cos squared theta
minus sine squared theta.

847
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:07,950
Anybody remember
that? cos(2theta)!

848
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:12,410


849
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:14,980
And this one.

850
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,830
Well, what do you
think is coming?

851
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:19,520
What do you think
is coming here?

852
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,940
I have 2r*cos(theta)
times r*sin(theta).

853
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:27,250
I have two, I've got
an r squared, again,

854
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,460
times 2cos(theta)*sin(theta).

855
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,380
So what's
2cos(theta)*sin(theta)?

856
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,460
sin(2theta).

857
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,790
You get it. sin(2theta).

858
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:41,670
And you know what's
coming next, right?

859
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:46,160
You know that now, the whole
family in polar coordinates --

860
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,590
what's the nth power?

861
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,020
We can now write down
the nth one in this list.

862
00:48:53,020 --> 00:49:04,620
It is r^n -- for the nth
pair, r^n times cos(n*theta),

863
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:09,960
and r^n sin(n*theta).

864
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:16,530
So those are the
twins, the u and the s

865
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:21,960
that we get if we use
polar coordinates.

866
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,640
So that's just terrific.

867
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,280
Now we have a whole
lot of solutions

868
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,100
to Laplace's equation.

869
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:31,710
And we have, don't forget,
all combinations of them.

870
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,780
And we're really ready to go.

871
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:41,220
So Friday we'll be solving
Laplace's equation in the cases

872
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:45,720
that we can do it, by
pencil and paper, by chalk.

873
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,990
And then, after that, comes
solving Laplace's equation

874
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,627
by finite differences
and finite elements.

875
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:52,127
