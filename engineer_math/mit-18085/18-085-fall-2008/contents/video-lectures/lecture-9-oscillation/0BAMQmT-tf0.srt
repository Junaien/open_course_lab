00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,930
PROFESSOR STRANG: Ready?

10
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,910
So let me recap the
important lecture

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,650
from last time that gave
the framework that we'll

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,480
see in Chapter two
and Chapter three,

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,640
really a major
part of the course.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,990
And our example was a line
of masses and springs.

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,190
So that's like, the first
example to start with.

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,700
And you remember,
there were three steps.

17
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,240
If we want to know how
much the masses displace

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,350
we have to get to the springs.

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,010
Difference in displacements gave
the stretching of the springs.

20
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,660
Then comes the material law,
Hooke's Law in this case,

21
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,160
with a matrix C that led to CAu.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,470
And then finally,
those spring forces

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,440
are balanced by the
external forces.

24
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,560
That brought in A transpose.

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,540
So that's the
picture to look for.

26
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:27,430
And I just mention it again
because it's so central.

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,660
So we'll be doing
other examples of that.

28
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,330
But I wanted to stay with
springs and masses for today.

29
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,560
To do another type of problem.

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,360
A problem in which time enters.

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,610
A problem in which we're not
looking for the steady state.

32
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,470
But it's Newton's Law
is going to come in.

33
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,220
This is actually Newton's Law.

34
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,790
You recognize mass.

35
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,090
You recognize acceleration.

36
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,380
And the force on
the spring is -Ku.

37
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,420
So when -Ku, when the force
came over to that side,

38
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,120
that's the equation
we're looking at.

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,810
So it's like time-out
for a discussion

40
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,290
of the very important
subject of time derivatives.

41
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:24,080
How do I solve initial
value problems now?

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,370
So I have some
starting time, I'm

43
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,780
given u(0), the starting
position of the springs,

44
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,600
and I'm given the
velocity at zero.

45
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,120
So I'm given two facts at zero.

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,000
That's very different from
the steady state problem

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,420
where you're given stuff
around the boundary.

48
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,290
Here we're given
stuff at the start.

49
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,540
Initial values instead
of boundary values.

50
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,000
So what does this mean?

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,130
It means that maybe I pull
the springs down and I let go.

52
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,080
And what do they do?

53
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,900
They oscillate.

54
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,830
And you will have
studied this equation.

55
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,600
I hope you've seen
that equation.

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,030
Because I think of it as
the fundamental equation

57
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,890
of mechanics.

58
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,740
In fact, I've even
used those words.

59
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,990
The fundamental equation
of mechanical engineering.

60
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:24,290
Well, it's Newton's
Law for a system.

61
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,830
So the matrix M
now has two masses.

62
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,800
In this case, it would
be a two by two system.

63
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,660
The matrix M would
have two masses.

64
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:42,850
Suppose mass one may be like,
nine and mass two is one.

65
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,380
So copying what our problem
is we'd have a nine and a one

66
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,550
multiplying u_1'' and u_2''.

67
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,160
Can I use prime
for a derivative?

68
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,430
Rather than dots,
because I'm never

69
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,820
too sure if the dot
is there or not.

70
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,690
So prime I can see.

71
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,040
And then plus our Ku.

72
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,860
And actually you know what K
will look like for this system.

73
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,020
It's fixed-fixed.

74
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,700
Well, let me write down
what K would look like.

75
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,270
Just because we saw
it at the very end.

76
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,140
What it looks like if there
are spring constants, c_1, c_2,

77
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,950
and c_3.

78
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:33,390
Can I just remind you
what that will look like?

79
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,310
So this will multiply
u and give zero.

80
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:43,930
So the mass matrix is
diagonal in the problem.

81
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,750
That's, diagonal matrices, we
certainly expect to be easy.

82
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,770
Almost as easy as
the identity matrix

83
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,320
where we would have
two equal masses.

84
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,620
Here it's just that
little bit more general

85
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,190
with two different masses.

86
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,840
And in here, the kind of thing
that we created just at the end

87
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,560
of the last lecture was
something like c_1+c_2

88
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:12,830
on the diagonal and a -c_2
and a -c_2 and a c_2+c_3.

89
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,110


90
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,420
So c_2 for the middle
spring is the one

91
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,900
that's really there with its
full little element matrix,

92
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,570
c_2, -c2; -c_2, c_2.

93
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:32,160
The c_1 part is only
coming in at the top

94
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,730
because it's connected
to a fixed support.

95
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,240
And c_3 is only coming
in at the bottom.

96
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,370
Anyway, that's the matrix
K. This is the matrix M.

97
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,020
And how do we solve the problem?

98
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,350
You've seen before, and now
ADINA Professor Bathe's code

99
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,590
or any other code would offer,
like, two different ways.

100
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:02,470
One way is because we have
constant coefficients here

101
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,370
we can expect a pretty clean
formula for the answer.

102
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,830
And because we're growing,
we're oscillating in time,

103
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,320
things are happening in
time, we expect eigenvectors,

104
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,160
eigenvalues to come in.

105
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,270
Into that formula.

106
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,980
I think it's worth just
repeating that formula.

107
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,700
How do you approach it?

108
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,860
And then the second,
the really serious issue

109
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,890
is how do you solve
equation like this

110
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:40,400
or even more general,
time-dependent problems.

111
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,410
I mean this is what finite
element codes are created for.

112
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,720
How do you study
the crash of a car?

113
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,170
So this isn't quite the
equation for a car crash.

114
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:57,360
What would be different
in a car crash?

115
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,370
There's a short section
later in Chapter two

116
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,340
called the reality of
computational engineering.

117
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,660
And the reality is, cars crash,
people drop their cell phones.

118
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,030
And those are very difficult
problems to compute with.

119
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,840
And of course, absolutely
impossible to use eigenvectors

120
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,040
because, well they're
not linear at all.

121
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,190
Right?

122
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,440
If you crash two cars,
if you want to study,

123
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,850
everything's happening
in like, a hundredth

124
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,330
of a second or something.

125
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,610
But what's happening
there is highly non-linear

126
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,330
so it's very much
more complicated.

127
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,030
And you take thousands
of time steps

128
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,050
maybe within the crash time.

129
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:52,090
And you're going to use finite
differences or finite elements.

130
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,150
So this is a chance
to say something

131
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:02,120
about this special equation
for finite difference method.

132
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,870
It's really 18.086 that takes
up these questions seriously.

133
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,780
If I choose a finite
difference method.

134
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,290
See, the thing is with
finite differences

135
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,610
you've got many, many choices.

136
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,710
There's only one way
to go in step one.

137
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,950
Eigenvectors, this thing has
got eigenvectors, you find them,

138
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,180
you're in.

139
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,420
But for the much more
general, typical problems

140
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,450
that you'll be solving
the rest of your lives,

141
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,380
finite differences
or finite elements,

142
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,170
you've got lots of choices.

143
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:41,270
And the issues that come up
are the accuracy of the choice.

144
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,590
Centered differences
often gives you

145
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,560
that extra order of accuracy.

146
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,820
Stability is something
we have not seen yet.

147
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,500
So what does stability mean?

148
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,900
Stability means that as I follow
my difference equation forward

149
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,250
in time it stays near
the true equation.

150
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,150
You'll see by example.

151
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,820
So some methods are
more stable than others,

152
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,970
some are completely
unstable and unusable.

153
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,470
And then, of course,
the other condition,

154
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:19,230
another desired requirement,
is speed of calculation.

155
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,250
So these balance each other.

156
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,200
It's a beautiful subject.

157
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,850
And let me just open the
door to that subject today.

158
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,900
May I start with the
eigenvector solution.

159
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,110
How would I solve this
equation by eigenvectors?

160
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,780
Well again, I'm going to
look for special solutions.

161
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,460
So let me write that
equation down again.

162
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,020
Mu''+Ku=0.

163
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,590


164
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,140
I'm taking zero external force.

165
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,090
So the springs and masses
are just oscillating.

166
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,770
Their total energy won't
change, it's a closed system.

167
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,260
The kinetic plus the potential
energy will stay constant

168
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,580
and we can show why.

169
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,380
There's a lot in this section,
by the way, section 2.2.

170
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,650
More than I would be able
to do in the lecture.

171
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,210
But let me capture
the key ideas.

172
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,840
So one key idea is
the natural idea when

173
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,910
we have constant coefficients.

174
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,970
Look for special solutions.

175
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:32,270
So let me say look for special
solutions of the form--

176
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,880
well, let's keep in mind always
the simplest model of all.

177
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,170
Let me put it over here because
I'll focus on it particularly,

178
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,370
especially.

179
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:49,380
The simplest case would be u'',
with a mass normalized to one,

180
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,600
plus u equal 0.

181
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,090
Just a single equation.

182
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,910
So that's just a single spring.

183
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,800
Single mass.

184
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,570
So the mass is just
oscillating up and down.

185
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:07,940
And we all know that it's
going to oscillate up and down,

186
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,710
sines and cosines are
going to come into here.

187
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,810
In fact, we know
that the solution

188
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:18,950
to that would be, this
could have cosine, this

189
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,350
would have some
cos(t)'s and some-- u

190
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:29,330
could be a combination
of cos(t) and sin(t).

191
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,250
Right?

192
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,240
And the A and B would
be used to match the two

193
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,670
initial conditions.

194
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,050
So that's what we've
got in the scalar case.

195
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:44,390
This is one spring. n is one.

196
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,490
We don't have a matrix
here, just a number.

197
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:53,330
But that's our guide
to the matrix case.

198
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,830
So now what am I
going to look for?

199
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,940
I'm going to look for u(t).

200
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:04,530
I'll look for special
solutions of the form cos--

201
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,700
They'll go at
different frequencies.

202
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,920
So the frequency
has to be found.

203
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,550
So that's the time dependence.

204
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,640
And then some, if I'm
lucky all the springs

205
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,740
will be going together.

206
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,850
So this x-- Am I going
to use x for eigenvector?

207
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,040
I think so, yes.

208
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,180
Let's use x for eigenvector.

209
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:37,690
So this is a vector, this
is a constant vector.

210
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:49,490
And this gives the oscillation.

211
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:55,910
Let me just already
start with that.

212
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,550
I've got two
unknowns here, right?

213
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,760
Two things that
I'm free to choose.

214
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,400
I'm free to choose
the frequency omega

215
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,320
and I'm free to
choose this vector x.

216
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,240
And I've like,
separated out time.

217
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,850
The way we've been doing
it with an e^(lambda*t).

218
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,740
We used an e^(lambda*t).

219
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,880
So that was sort of right
for a first order equation.

220
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,940
Cosine is right for a second
order equation like this.

221
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,770
When is that a solution
to my equation?

222
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,360
May I just plug it in?

223
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,160
So I'm going to just plug it in?

224
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,910
Substitute is a better
word than plug in, right?

225
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:42,170
So shall I just plug it in?

226
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,810
So I get M times that
second derivative.

227
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,820
So the second
derivative of the cosine

228
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:54,390
is the cosine with a
minus, M omega squared.

229
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,580
Is that right?

230
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,750
Yes?

231
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,830
Times what?

232
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,710
So that's what came from
the time derivative.

233
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,540
Times cos times
this, cos(omega*t)x.

234
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,040


235
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,550
Two time derivatives brought
down a minus omega squared.

236
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,440
And the other part is just
K times u, cos(omega*t)x.

237
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,880


238
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,270
And that should be zero.

239
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,130
And this is supposed to
be a good solution that

240
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:33,780
works for all time.

241
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,470
This is what I want to be zero.

242
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,330
Do you see what's left?

243
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:45,310
Kx from here.

244
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:53,240
And putting that on the other
side, M omega squared x.

245
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,140
Can I write the omega squared
that way? omega squared Mx.

246
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,510


247
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:05,015
Then if that is satisfied
then the differential equation

248
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:05,850
is satisfied.

249
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,960
I've got a solution.

250
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,970
So I'm looking for K and
I'm looking for x and omega.

251
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,940
And by the way, I could
also have sin(omega*t) here.

252
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,660
As well as cosine just
the way over there.

253
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,140
Sines and cosines both possible.

254
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,870
So sin(omega*t)x.

255
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,320


256
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,620
It would be exactly the
same except that it'd be

257
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,520
a sin(omega*t) that
I'd be dividing out.

258
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,750
And again, I'd
come back to this.

259
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,640
This is key problem.

260
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,760
And do you see that somehow
here we have an eigenvector x

261
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,850
and an eigenvalue omega squared?

262
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:54,110
An eigenvalue omega
squared, right.

263
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,460
But there is one little twist.

264
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,590
It's not quite our standard
eigenvalue problem.

265
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,860
What's the extra guy
that's present in that box

266
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,500
that we don't usually see?

267
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,960
M. M is the new person
there, new thing.

268
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,220
The mass matrix.

269
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,660
Which, if all masses
where one, the mass matrix

270
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,740
would be the identity.

271
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,730
We would be back.

272
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,870
We would just have
our standard problem.

273
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,810
I just have to say a
word about the case

274
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,780
when the mass matrix is there.

275
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,370
It's still an
eigenvalue problem.

276
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:37,000
If you like, I can bring
M inverse over here.

277
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,180
I could write it as M inverse
K x equal omega squared x.

278
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:49,490
So I'm looking for the
eigenvalues of M inverse K.

279
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,640
That's really what I'm doing.

280
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,230
The eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of M inverse K.

281
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:03,610
But I'm always trying to be
like, aesthetically right.

282
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:09,210
And what's-- M inverse K has
just a little something wrong

283
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:09,710
with it.

284
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,720
Which is?

285
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,620
It's not symmetric.

286
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,320
If I take my matrix K, which
is beautifully symmetric,

287
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,530
and my M, which is
beautifully symmetric,

288
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,740
but when I do M inverse K,
do you see what'll happen?

289
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,290
The inverse of that
matrix will have a 1/9.

290
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:31,650
When I do M inverse*K, that
row will get divided by nine.

291
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,380
And the second row won't
change because I've got a one.

292
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,180
So it just like,
spoiled things a little.

293
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,250
You can deal with it.

294
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,030
But actually, in some way
it's better to keep it right.

295
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,120
And MATLAB is totally
okay with that.

296
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,930
So MATLAB would use the command
eig -- and other systems too --

297
00:17:54,930 --> 00:18:03,140
of K, M. Just tell
MATLAB the two matrices.

298
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,300
Then it solves that problem.

299
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,450
It will print out the,
well if you just typed eig,

300
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,790
it would print out
the eigenvalues.

301
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,810
If you ask it for the
eigenvector matrix,

302
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,380
it'll print those too.

303
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:24,590
So that has the grand name
generalized eigenvalue problem.

304
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,380
Generalized because
it's got an M in there.

305
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,970
I don't know if you've met
these problems where there could

306
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,710
be an M. It's just a
natural, and it's not really

307
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,000
a big deal, particularly when M
is a positive diagonal matrix.

308
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,850
It's not a big deal at all.

309
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,860
It's the same codes essentially
finding the eigenvalues

310
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,230
and eigenvectors.

311
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,050
So suppose we have them.

312
00:18:52,050 --> 00:19:01,200
We expect n positive
eigenvalues,

313
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,980
and those'll be
the omega squareds.

314
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,670
And each one comes
with its eigenvector.

315
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:14,110
And complete set,
everything is good.

316
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,460
We're talking about symmetric
positive definite matrices.

317
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,300
Notice that K is
positive definite.

318
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,800
That was what our whole
last weeks have been about.

319
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,770
And M is obviously
positive definite.

320
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:34,660
So it's a complete--
it's a perfect set-up

321
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,570
for the eigenvalue problem.

322
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,160
I just want to think
through the final step.

323
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,560
After we find the eigenvalues,
lambda, the omega squareds,

324
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,370
then we know the omegas and
we find the eigenvectors, x,

325
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,610
how do you write the answer?

326
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,000
So what have I done so far?

327
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,030
I've looked for some
special solutions.

328
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,170
And I will find them.

329
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,140
So I've found these omegas.

330
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,460
They can go with sines or
cosines, I found the x's.

331
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,210
Now what's the general solution?

332
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,650
If I have these solutions
to my great equation

333
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,710
there, what's the
general solution? u(t).

334
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:30,160
So this would be
the big picture.

335
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,270
What can I do in
linear equations?

336
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,130
Linear combinations.

337
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,270
That's what linear algebra is
all about, linear combinations.

338
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,750
So I could take a linear
combination of these cosines,

339
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,160
so cos(omega_1*t)x_1.

340
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,740
So that would be
a solution coming

341
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,560
from the first eigenvector and
eigenvalue, or the square root,

342
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,120
times any constant.

343
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,740
And then, of course,
I could have a b_1.

344
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,300
I'll use b's for the sines.

345
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,610
(omega_1*t), x_1.

346
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,670
So that's just like that.

347
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,240
But it's used the sines, which
would also solve the equation.

348
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,770
And then all the
way down to x_n's.

349
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,240
Right?

350
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,750
So I've got 2n.

351
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:30,810
2n simple solutions. n cosines
times eigenvectors and n sines

352
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,880
times those same eigenvectors.

353
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,360
Why do I want 2n?

354
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,360
I've got 2n constants then to
choose, the a's and the b's.

355
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,160
And how do I choose them?

356
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:53,070
What's the next step?

357
00:21:53,070 --> 00:22:03,460
Using eigenvectors, maybe I just
mention again the three steps.

358
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:09,420
The three step method.

359
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:19,710
Step one: find a's and b's.

360
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,216
Oh, now you have to
answer my question.

361
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,090
Where are the a's and
b's going to come from?

362
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,560
What's going to determine
these 2n constants,

363
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,100
the a's and the b's?

364
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,780
The initial
conditions, of course.

365
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,320
We've got two initial
conditions, this is a vector.

366
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,860
We're talking about
a system here.

367
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,910
I've got position
of both masses.

368
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,880
I've got the initial
velocity of both masses.

369
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,840
And the a's, they come
from, because the a's go

370
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,800
with the cosines and so they're
going to be the ones associated

371
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,330
with u(0), will give this.

372
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:09,780
Will give a combination-- Will
give the a's. u(0) will be

373
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:15,690
a_1*x_1 + a_n*x_n.

374
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,670
This is at t=0.

375
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,610


376
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,040
So I'm using the
initial conditions.

377
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,170
u(0) is a combination
of those eigenvectors.

378
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:32,510
So this is from the
initial conditions.

379
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,860
And the b's of course are going
to come from u'(0), the initial

380
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,330
velocity, because
they go with sines.

381
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:47,020
So sines start at zero but
they have an initial velocity.

382
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,920
So that's step one.

383
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,550
That finds the constants.

384
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,450
It splits the problem
into these normal modes.

385
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,560
It finds how much
of each eigenvector

386
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,260
is in there at the start.

387
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,450
Step two?

388
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,820
So it's really worth
seeing these three steps

389
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,090
because they just repeat and
repeat for all applications

390
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,230
of eigenvalues.

391
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,670
Step two is what?

392
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,300
Step two is follow each of
these guys forward in time.

393
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,810
Follow them to any time.

394
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,870
What does that mean?

395
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,500
That means just put in
the cosines and the sines.

396
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:44,260
So the a's go to a*cos(omega*t).

397
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,300
So I'm just saying what
happens to those coefficients.

398
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,950
Each one.

399
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:57,910
Let's see. a_i, say, goes to
a_i is multiplied by the cosine.

400
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:03,850
And the b's, b_i's go
to b_i*sin(omega_i*t).

401
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:08,170


402
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:13,840
So now we followed the
coefficients forward in time.

403
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,830
And step three?

404
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,380
The final step is?

405
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,670
So here, we're
following each one.

406
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,260
So the pattern is
always the same one.

407
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:31,370
Take your starting
conditions, split them up

408
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:34,990
into eigenvectors.

409
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,050
Follow each eigenvector.

410
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,520
And then step three is?

411
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,790
Reassemble.

412
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,010
Put them back together.

413
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:49,974
Step three is the solution.
u at that later time t is

414
00:25:49,974 --> 00:25:50,890
a_1*cos(omega_1*t)x_1.

415
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,510


416
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,150
And b_1*sin(omega_1*t)x_1.

417
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,720


418
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,210
Those are the two guys
that are reflecting

419
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,040
the fundamental mode.

420
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:14,700
And then we have a_2's and b_2's
multiplied by cosines and sines

421
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,650
and times x_2 and so on.

422
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,160
Put the pieces together.

423
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,920
So it's split the
initial conditions,

424
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:31,340
follow each
eigenvector, reassemble.

425
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,830
It's the heart of
Fourier methods,

426
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,720
it's the heart of
using eigenvectors.

427
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:49,610
And there's a little code in
the book that does exactly that.

428
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,920
So let's just pause a moment.

429
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,900
This was the
eigenvector solution.

430
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:04,840
And now I want to talk
about computational science.

431
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,750
For which this
problem is a model,

432
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:12,870
but the problem has probably got
more complications and things

433
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:19,870
change in time, whatever.

434
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,740
This was an exact solution.

435
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:28,670
That's more than we hope
for in real computations.

436
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:32,860
We hope for accuracy, but we
don't hope for 100% accuracy

437
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:38,570
unless we have this
exact model problem.

438
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,680
So we use finite differences.

439
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,550
Ready for finite differences?

440
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:50,610
So this is method one, which
allows you to understand

441
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,030
the model problem.

442
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:56,120
And now comes method two,
which allows you to compute

443
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,220
much more, many more problems.

444
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,850
And if I do it just for
this, let me come back

445
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,610
to just this model.

446
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:14,390
One spring and one mass.

447
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:22,540
Shall we start the mass at rest?

448
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,960
Let me make that the answer.

449
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,400
I want that to be the answer.

450
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:34,960
So I'm going to start with u(0)
to be zero-- to be one, right?

451
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,990
I'm going to start with u(0)
to be one and u'(0) to be zero.

452
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,870
Because the cosine starts
at one and its derivative

453
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,030
starts at zero.

454
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,090
Apologies that this is
such a simple model.

455
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:54,390
I'm just pulling this
this mass down and let go.

456
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:58,310
I just pull it down an
amount one, I let go,

457
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:05,980
it oscillates forever.

458
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:14,130
How do I draw the
motion of a single mass?

459
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,170
A picture is
important and we have

460
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,480
to think what's in the picture.

461
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:26,150
So I think the picture should
be, maybe u in this direction

462
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,480
and maybe u' in this direction.

463
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,600
So it's the u, u' plane.

464
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,200
The position-velocity plane.

465
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,380
Sometimes called
the phase plane.

466
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,570
I'll just write that
word down, phase plane.

467
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,090
And what will be
our picture here?

468
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:50,200
It starts there, right? u(0) is
one, no velocity, starts there.

469
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,770
Oh, and then it
just follows cos(t).

470
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,210
And of course, I
know what u' is.

471
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,540
If u is cos(t), u' is -sin(t).

472
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,820


473
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,790
Let me put that somewhere where
my picture won't run over it,

474
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,620
up here maybe. u' is -sin(t).

475
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:16,720


476
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,710
Help me out.

477
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:23,510
If as time increases,
I follow this point,

478
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,110
the x-coordinate is cos(t).

479
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,620
The y-coordinate is -sin(t).

480
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,530
It's a circle.

481
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,050
It's a circle.

482
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,830
So I just buzz along it,
because of that minus sign,

483
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,980
the circle goes this way around.

484
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,370
It's a unit circle.

485
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:45,970
Goes on forever.

486
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,760
And actually cos squared
plus sine squared

487
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,420
is one, of course, that's why
it's a circle of radius one.

488
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:58,450
And that represents the
total energy actually.

489
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,390
I'm trying to draw a circle.

490
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:07,490
Actually how would you get
your computer to draw a circle?

491
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,640
I'm thinking not
just one circle.

492
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,810
I want to refresh it.

493
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:14,080
I mean, I want to
follow this in time.

494
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:23,440
So I want to draw, I want to
follow a point around a circle.

495
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,380
Well I suppose what
you would do would be

496
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,740
to ask it to plot those points.

497
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,490
That's not allowed.

498
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:37,600
I want you to follow the
solution to the equation.

499
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,190
I want to take that equation
whose exact solution is

500
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,950
a circle and I want to use
finite differences in time.

501
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,460
So I'm going to
take finite steps.

502
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,420
Of course that's what
the computer has to do.

503
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,280
The computer will
take finite steps.

504
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,310
So I'd be very happy if
those finite steps keep me

505
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,270
on the circle.

506
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:03,730
And I'd be even happier if
it came around exactly right

507
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:12,910
at 2pi but it's not going to.

508
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,450
I want finite differences.

509
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,950
I want to replace that
differential equation

510
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,330
by finite differences.

511
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:23,110
And when we do this
equation, we're

512
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:26,440
practically doing that
one at the same time.

513
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:33,130
So this model will be fine.

514
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,070
So I'm going to introduce finite
differences for this equation.

515
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,940
And everybody,
we've been talking

516
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,010
about how to replace
second derivatives

517
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,860
by second differences.

518
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,600
So that looks good.

519
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,580
Let me write down,
maybe I can write down

520
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:57,420
three or four possible
finite differences.

521
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:07,300
For u'' I think I'll write
down u_(n+1) - 2u_n + u_(n-1).

522
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,940
That's the second
difference that

523
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,290
replaces the second
derivative, divided by what?

524
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:20,120
What do you think goes
in the denominator now?

525
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,170
Square of what?

526
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,390
Yeah, now what's the right name?

527
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,480
It's going to be
something squared.

528
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,780
What do I put down there?

529
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,540
The step size.

530
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,460
I don't want to call
it delta x, right?

531
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,280
What should I call that?

532
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,970
Delta t would be
natural, delta t.

533
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:44,350
Or h, I could again use h
just to have a shorthand.

534
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:47,150
That's my second difference.

535
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,110
It's centered, it's
the natural choice.

536
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,230
And not the only
choice, by the way.

537
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,280
Oh.

538
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,600
If I'm an astronomer or
like, Professor Wisdom here.

539
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:05,720
So he followed
Pluto around, right?

540
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,890
And discovered that Pluto
wasn't a planet, right?

541
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,030
He discovered that
the motion of Pluto

542
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:14,970
was not like, regular
like the Earth.

543
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,090
I think the Earth is regular.

544
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,300
But Pluto has chaotic motion.

545
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,280
So it does crazy stuff.

546
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,010
Right.

547
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:30,970
Well we're looking for very
periodic, circular motion here.

548
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:35,040
So what I was going to
say, Professor Wisdom, he

549
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,930
would sneer at this
second differences, right?

550
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:43,020
I mean, as we'll see that's
got decent accuracy, but not

551
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,130
accuracy that would
allow you to follow

552
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:50,020
Pluto for 100 million years.

553
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,170
But it'll do for us.

554
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:54,520
We're not going 100
million years here.

555
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,960
So now comes -u.

556
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,550
Now, question.

557
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,330
I'm taking this,
the u term and I'm

558
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,090
putting it on the other side.

559
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,090
So mass is one.

560
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,800
Acceleration is this.

561
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,450
The force is -u.

562
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:23,410
Now comes the big question.

563
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:26,750
For -u, do I use
the newest value?

564
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,680
Do I use the middle value?

565
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,740
Or do I use the oldest value?

566
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,320
Or some combination?

567
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,100
If I want high
accuracy, oh, then I

568
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,600
go way up in these
differences and I

569
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,010
find tricky combinations
that get me above first

570
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,530
and second order accuracy.

571
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,370
But let's not go there.

572
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:53,670
So I've got to make
one of those choices.

573
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,020
And that choice is going
to decide, so I mean,

574
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,460
this is a choice
you have to make

575
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,740
when you have such a problem.

576
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,990
Where are you going
to evaluate this?

577
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,550
I guess one choice
jumps out as natural.

578
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:16,750
What would you think of doing?

579
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,060
Well how many would do that one?

580
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,000
So those are people, that's
the conservative choice,

581
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,550
the stable.

582
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,510
And then, how many
would do this?

583
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,010
Yeah, you would do that, right.

584
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,450
I would call that
the leapfrog choice.

585
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,950
Somehow, this
second difference is

586
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,460
leaping over this middle point.

587
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,750
So that would be
the leapfrog method.

588
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:52,620
And then if I use a very
low-- to use the first value

589
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:58,420
would be-- So my point is those
are three different choices.

590
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:04,810
And each one has these
questions of accuracy.

591
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:08,690
The middle one will be more
accurate because it's centered.

592
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,390
Each one has a
question of stability.

593
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,440
Ah, you don't see stability yet.

594
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,680
So that's the point of the
rest of the lecture is to see.

595
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,210
What is this stability question?

596
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:30,060
The issue of speed, speed
would be, this is the slow one.

597
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:35,010
Because it involves, I have
to bring u_(n+1) over there.

598
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:39,140
And if I've got a system
of equations and then I,

599
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,750
it would take me some time.

600
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:48,040
This would be called
an implicit method.

601
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,770
The new u_(n+1) is only given
implicitly because it's showing

602
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,010
up on the right-hand side.

603
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,000
I've got to move it
over to the left.

604
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,670
If it's non-linear I've
got a system to solve.

605
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:05,350
It's safer, but more expensive.

606
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:11,250
But this would be
the natural choice.

607
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:19,680
I want to get eigenvalues
into this picture.

608
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,150
So I'm going to do the
step we often do when

609
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,330
we see a second order equation.

610
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,290
That is, reduce it to two
first order equations.

611
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,360
Can I do that and
see the same thing?

612
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,730
So what would be my two
first order equations.

613
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,720
My unknowns will be u and u'.

614
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:46,530
So it'll be first order,
the derivative of u and u'.

615
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,690
Shall I call it v for velocity?

616
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,670
Let me write down, I don't
need to write this fancy.

617
00:38:53,670 --> 00:39:05,100
The two equations will
be, u'=v. And v' is what?

618
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:10,290
So u'=v sort of told me what
v was. v is the velocity,

619
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,680
the time derivative of du/dt.

620
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,370
And now the derivative
of the velocity, now that

621
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,840
should reflect my true equation.

622
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,910
So this is all
coming from u''+u=0.

623
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:24,190


624
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:29,680
So v' is what? v' is u''.

625
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,730
Do I want -u there?

626
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:39,230
Yeah, that's my equation.
v', which is u'', is -u.

627
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:39,740
Good.

628
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,800
That's my system.

629
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,270
So I have a matrix here.

630
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:51,670
I have a two by two system with
a matrix [0, 1; -1, 0] I guess.

631
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:57,310
So while thinking about
difference methods-- So this,

632
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,880
I was thinking about a
second order equation.

633
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,580
I went right to it.

634
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,500
Here I'm thinking about
a first order system.

635
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,690
A lot of problems come
in first order systems.

636
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,460
Gas dynamics comes
as a big first order

637
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:16,920
system for those components
of mass, momentum, energy,

638
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,150
typically five non-linear
equations in gas dynamics.

639
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,970
I mean, that's a very,
very serious problem,

640
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,050
how to solve those.

641
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,410
Here we've got a much
simpler model problem,

642
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,660
linear, constant coefficients.

643
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:40,850
But what do we do?

644
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,410
Can I propose three
possibilities here?

645
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:48,210
And actually they are identical
to these three possibilities.

646
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,760
If I just switch over
to a first order system.

647
00:40:50,760 --> 00:41:01,180
So possibility one_
Possibility one is that u_(n+1)

648
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:05,470
and v_(n+1)-- So the
u_(n+1) would be,

649
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,820
how do I model that equation?

650
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:15,480
u_(n+1) is u_n + delta t*v_n.

651
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,840
That would be a natural-- Right?

652
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,410
Let me just pause
there, because that's

653
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:27,820
meant to be the natural
forward difference.

654
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:33,770
So I replaced u' by
u_(n+1)-u_n over delta t.

655
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:38,480
And I replaced v by
the value I know.

656
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:45,010
And do you know whose name
is associated with that?

657
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,420
I'm almost going
to say his name.

658
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,490
It's just, I replace a
differential equation

659
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,530
by a difference
equation where each step

660
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:57,470
I just could figure
out what the slope is

661
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:02,130
and I go along a straight line.

662
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:05,020
Delta t further along.

663
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,350
Do you know his name?

664
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,970
Euler, Euler, right.

665
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,980
It's Euler's method.

666
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,530
The very first method
you would think of.

667
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,400
Right?

668
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,870
So I'm doing the
same for v. This

669
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:27,880
is my position I've reached.

670
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,894
So Euler's method
is replace this

671
00:42:29,894 --> 00:42:31,060
by over delta t equals -u_n.

672
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:38,010
v_(n+1)-v_n over
delta t equals -u_n.

673
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,940
So this is Euler's idea.

674
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,880
Predict the new value
by a forward difference

675
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,370
starting from where the slope
of the line is this old one.

676
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:55,870
That's the first difference
method you would think of.

677
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:59,350
So now if I multiply up by delta
t I have a minus delta t*u_n.

678
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:09,670


679
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:14,020
Good time to pay attention.

680
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,870
This is forward Euler.

681
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:27,340
Forward Euler.

682
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,520
The time step, you
follow the derivative,

683
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,800
what the derivative is
at the start of the step.

684
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,650
You follow it for a little step.

685
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:39,290
Ah, let me draw what
the thing would do.

686
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:42,670
Shall I draw what
forward Euler will do?

687
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,900
So we're here.

688
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,560
And what's our first step?

689
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,490
Our first step.

690
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:51,410
So we're starting at v
is zero at the start.

691
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,950
So u won't change in one step.

692
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:58,380
But u is one, so v will go down.

693
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:04,900
I think the first step
will take us there.

694
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,220
That point was (1, 0).

695
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:13,330
And I think the second
step, u came from the zero,

696
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,450
so it'll still be a one.

697
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:19,780
And v came from a
zero, but minus delta.

698
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:27,840
I think it'll just be 1-delta t.

699
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:33,320
It's left the circle, of course.

700
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:42,780
And what do you think happens
when I do 1,000 steps?

701
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,920
This is two lines in MATLAB.

702
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,900
Just write those equations
for the next u coming

703
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:57,000
from the previous u starting
at (1, 0) and see what happens.

704
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,790
And what do you think?

705
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:03,060
It's going to sort of go around.

706
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,810
I mean, it's a reasonable--
Euler wasn't dumb.

707
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:10,750
Anything true here is the
fact that Euler was not dumb.

708
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,620
He had a bunch of ideas.

709
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:16,880
This wasn't his greatest.

710
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,280
But it's the starting
point of any,

711
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,560
if you have to code some
complicated problem,

712
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,620
start with Euler, forward Euler.

713
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,730
What'll happen?

714
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:30,010
It'll spiral out.

715
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:30,720
Exactly.

716
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,800
It'll spiral out.

717
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,070
And if I was an
eigenvalue person,

718
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:44,300
I guess which I probably am,
I would look at the, there's

719
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,320
some matrix here that's finding
the new u, v from the old u,

720
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,670
v. Maybe we can
even find out, write

721
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:57,110
above what that matrix is.

722
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:00,120
The new u, v come
from the old u, v,

723
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,890
well there is the
identity matrix.

724
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,850
Here is a delta t.

725
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:07,730
And here is our minus delta t.

726
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:11,780
That would be my matrix.

727
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,930
That's the forward Euler matrix.

728
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:19,830
The growth matrix for
forward Euler is that.

729
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:24,200
Now what do you think about
its eigenvalues before?

730
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,960
Spiral out was the right answer.

731
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,810
If delta t is small it'll
stay close to the circle,

732
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:38,790
but it'll spiral out from it.

733
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:45,590
So if we were following a
planet, it would just be off.

734
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:48,310
So I can't immediately,
well you could almost

735
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:51,010
see the eigenvalues
of this matrix.

736
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,210
What's the determinant
of that matrix?

737
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,910
What's the determinant of G?

738
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:58,510
I'm just asking you
to think through.

739
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,310
You see a matrix like this.

740
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:03,630
You wonder about its eigenvalues
so you take the determinant.

741
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:06,480
And what do you get?

742
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,330
One, something bigger
than one or less than one?

743
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:11,420
Bigger.

744
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,940
So that tells me what?

745
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:16,600
Since the determinant is the
product of lambda_1*lambda_2,

746
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,560
whatever those guys are, at
least one of those eigenvalues

747
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,540
is bigger than one.

748
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,120
This has an
eigenvalue, actually,

749
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:31,160
the actual eigenvalues of
this happen to be one from

750
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:36,050
the identity matrix and
then this guy is what was

751
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:41,700
our example of an imaginary
eigenvalue, i*delta t.

752
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,330
Bigger than one
in absolute value.

753
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:49,090
It goes out.

754
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:57,020
So that's forward Euler
corresponding to that choice.

755
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:00,910
Can I change to a second,
to Euler's other choice?

756
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,970
And you can guess
what its name is.

757
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:09,460
Instead of forward
Euler it's going to be?

758
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:14,200
Backward Euler.

759
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,670
Euler said, if you don't like
it, I've got another one.

760
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:19,750
And what will happen then?

761
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:25,490
Backward Euler is going to
use, instead of the old value,

762
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:29,950
it will use the new values here.

763
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:33,470
So these differences,
you see that this is now

764
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:39,400
a backward difference?

765
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,370
So I'm at time n+1.

766
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,910
I'm at the new time.

767
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,620
And this goes back from that.

768
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:49,230
So this is at the new time and
this is a difference backward.

769
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,020
And what happens now?

770
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,360
Well, we could follow
backward Euler.

771
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,190
We could follow its first step.

772
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,710
What would its first step be?

773
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:00,210
u_n+u_1.

774
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:07,690
This is-- No, I can't follow
that first step so easily.

775
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,890
Help me out by just
making a guess.

776
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:14,260
What do you think
backward Euler does?

777
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,590
It spirals in.

778
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:22,890
Right, the cover of the book
has forward Euler, I think,

779
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,950
is on the cover of the textbook.

780
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,460
Spiraling out in the front.

781
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,020
But maybe the back cover
also has Euler spiraling in.

782
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,990
So here is backward Euler.

783
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:36,000
And after I take
a bunch of steps

784
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,780
it comes back somewhere
there, but it's spiraled in.

785
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,510
No good.

786
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:47,120
Have we got one minute
for the good method?

787
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:52,550
You're guessing
that it's this one?

788
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:53,780
How does that work?

789
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:58,760
Actually, it's pretty neat.

790
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,590
So my question is, where
do I evaluate these guys?

791
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:07,950
So this is like
forward and backward.

792
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:14,050
The u equation, so I
know u_n and v_n, right?

793
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:14,800
Everybody with me?

794
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,670
I've got to time in,
I know u_n and v_n,

795
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:22,160
the position and velocity,
approximately at point n.

796
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,810
And I want to go n+1.

797
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,950


798
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:28,860
What I know is v_n.

799
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,360
So that's great.

800
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,190
But what's going to change here?

801
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:39,370
Now I know u_(n+1) from
the first equation.

802
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,520
What shall I do, where
shall I evaluate u

803
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,160
in the second equation?

804
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,790
At n+1.

805
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:47,980
Why not?

806
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,360
I know it already
from the first step,

807
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,180
from the forward step
with this equation.

808
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,060
I've taken u forward.

809
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:03,830
So I'll use that forward
value of u in the v equation.

810
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:08,080
So it's forward and
backward at the same time.

811
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:16,700
And the net result if I go
back from my system of two

812
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,570
first order equations back
to one second order equation,

813
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:24,240
I'll find the centered guy.

814
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:34,170
And what do you think happens
with that centered difference?

815
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:39,250
I think MATLAB would
have to show it.

816
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:42,370
And look in Section
2.2 for the picture

817
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:44,960
that shows the leapfrog method.

818
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,270
So what do you think?

819
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:57,690
I'm having to depend
on my memory now.

820
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,190
It stays almost on the circle.

821
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:05,840
I think it maybe, it stays
very close to the circle.

822
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:11,650
And comes back almost at the
right time, but not exactly.

823
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,690
Because we have an error here.

824
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:15,950
No, we haven't got
the real equation.

825
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:19,620
We've got a difference equation.

826
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:23,590
So maybe that's
the point to say.

827
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,480
When you start with a
differential equation

828
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,890
you've got various choices.

829
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,430
Backward is actually safer.

830
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:37,600
Probably for a car crash.

831
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,000
No, actually I think
for a car crash

832
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,380
they would use
forward differences

833
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,930
because they have
to take so many.

834
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,090
Let me check on that.

835
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:54,430
But for our problem, this
one, leapfrog is the winner.

836
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,690
Actually, if anybody
does computation

837
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,750
in computational
chemistry, I mean

838
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:03,070
that's a subject that uses
giant supercomputers to follow

839
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:07,230
molecular dynamics, to follow
what molecules are doing

840
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:09,770
at high speed, very high speed.

841
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:13,410
So this, there's a giant
number multiplying that u.

842
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:19,160
And they use leapfrog method.

843
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,040
I'll say a little
more Friday if I can

844
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:26,110
about this general subject,
because it's so important.
