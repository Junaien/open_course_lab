7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:21,850
PROFESSOR: So, ready for
the second lecture about --

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,090
second to last lecture about the
linear one-way wave equation,

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,810
so the model for
hyperbolic equations.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:37,350
That word, hyperbolic,
tells me that signals are

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,140
traveling with finite speed.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,530
In this case, the speed
is c and in this case,

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,290
the signals are only
going to the left.

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,600
The two-way wave equation
will travel left and right,

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,740
but again, finite speed.

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,770
I emphasize finite speed,
because for the heat equation,

17
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,660
the speed is infinite.

18
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:07,920
As soon as you change an initial
condition, at any later time,

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,250
you immediately feel the effect
-- probably a small effect way,

20
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,340
way out.

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,000
So diffusion travels
with infinite speed.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,110
Waves travel with finite speed.

23
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:30,085
The difference sort of is that
the true true growth factor G

24
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:33,510
-- tiy remember, the
true growth factor was,

25
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:39,690
for the wave equation --
This is the G for the --

26
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,520
that multiplies the
exponential e to the i*k*x

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,670
in the difference equation
-- and G, the true G,

28
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:54,470
is e to the i*k*c*t.

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,940
So that -- what I
was going to say is,

30
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,860
that has absolute value 1.

31
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,130
Again, a difference
from the heat equation.

32
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,380
For the heat equation
with diffusion,

33
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,790
g will be smaller than 1.

34
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,320
You're losing energy.

35
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,090
For the wave equation,
the energy is constant

36
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,650
and the wave is just moving.

37
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,650
So it's a little more delicate,
because we're trying to --

38
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,150
this G in the difference
equation has to stay --

39
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,580
be somehow close to that one,
which is right on the unit

40
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,460
circle and yet,
we got to stay --

41
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,750
we can't go outside
the unit circle.

42
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,160
So here are two methods.

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,860
We had one method
last time that worked.

44
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,550
That was one-sided
differences and of course, you

45
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,800
had to take the difference on
the good side, the upwind side,

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,320
and that was first order.

47
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,160
The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
condition

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,490
was the same as the von
Neumann stability condition

49
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,390
and it was r between 0 and 1.

50
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:15,180
r is this ratio, c delta t
over delta x, it comes in.

51
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,290
It comes into the wave equation.

52
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:24,150
So now, we really have to
think about better methods,

53
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,800
other methods.

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,970
And here are two:
Lax-Friedrichs,

55
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,380
which will only be first order.

56
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,160
So when I -- these are the
questions I always ask,

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,290
and then finally, experiment.

58
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,820
I mean, answering these
questions will certainly

59
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,460
be a guide to what we'll
see experimentally,

60
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,150
but there's more to learn from
actually doing the numbers.

61
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:00,810
The accuracy, Lax-Fridrichs,
will be only first order,

62
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,750
whereas Lax-Wendroff
will be second order.

63
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,240
So with respect to accuracy,
that's certainly better.

64
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,100
Can we see that maybe
without too much calculation?

65
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,620
The notes would have
the more details.

66
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,630
Can you see -- here's
Lax-Wendroff, Lax-Friedrichs.

67
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,030
So what's the idea
of Lax-Friedrichs?

68
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,020
You remember the total failure,
the complete and absolute

69
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,690
failure when we used a time
difference there and a space

70
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,820
difference there?

71
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,510
You remember that that
gave the time difference

72
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,960
that produced a 1 in G and
this space difference produced

73
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,530
an imaginary part in G, so
we had G as 1 plus something

74
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,090
imaginary and we were outside
the circle automatically.

75
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,310
Friedrichs thought of a
way to get around that.

76
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,650
Instead of using U_(j, n)
here, instead of the backward

77
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:14,170
difference, he replaced U_(j,
n) by the average of that value

78
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:20,000
and that value, so that both
sides now involved just two

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,460
numbers -- U_(j, n) --
this one and this one.

80
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,970
This one is not used now.

81
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,250
Again, still first order,
you won't be surprised

82
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:42,410
that this approximation, this
has got first-order error.

83
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,410
But stability, now, is back
with us and easy to check

84
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,530
because now each new value
depends on what old values --

85
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,220
just these two, and
with what coefficients?

86
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,910
So let me just check
stability for Lax-Friedrichs.

87
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:09,360
So U_(j+1, n), the new value,
is some multiple of this guy,

88
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,690
the one on the left, and
some multiple of this one,

89
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,270
the one on the right.

90
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,980
What are those multiples?

91
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,480
Let's see.

92
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,820
I'm going to move things
over to the right-hand side

93
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,840
of the equation, so I think
there's a half and then I think

94
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,420
there's an r over
-- minus, I guess.

95
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,720
This is the one that comes
in with a minus sign --

96
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,110
it's the one on the left.

97
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,950
And the one on the
right, U_(j+1, n),

98
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,200
there's a half plus r over 2.

99
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,300
Simple idea.

100
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:56,030
Simple idea and it has one
important advantage over

101
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,060
upwind, one-sided
that we saw last time.

102
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,090
It's not a great method.

103
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,520
It's only first order here.

104
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,380
If I -- and you see when
it's going to be stable?

105
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,820
The coefficients add to 1.

106
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,760
Our coefficients
always add to 1, right?

107
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,610
Because if we have
a constant state,

108
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,990
this next step should
be that same state.

109
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:32,200
It's not going to change, but
instead of having the typical 1

110
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,660
in the G, I have -- it's
split into a half --

111
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,450
so what is G for this guy?

112
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,740
G for this guy is this number:
1 minus r over 2 times e

113
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:55,410
to the minus i*k delta x plus
this number times e to the plus

114
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,880
i*k delta x.

115
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,980
You're seeing, now, the pattern.

116
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:09,685
So I've sort of jumped to
G without plugging in the e

117
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:15,150
to the i*k*x, taking a step
and then factoring out e

118
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,190
to the i*k*x.

119
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,990
I did it without writing
down the e to the i*k*x.

120
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,410
This is what factors out.

121
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,420
Maybe a 1 plus r
would be more correct.

122
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:37,510
So stability requires
this complex number,

123
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,260
which I could write
in different ways.

124
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,040
The real part there
would be a cosine.

125
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,820
This would actually be the
cosine plus r times the sine --

126
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,430
plus i*r times the sine.

127
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:56,150
This is really -- I could
rewrite that as cos k delta x

128
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:01,630
plus i*r sine k delta x.

129
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,150
I don't know which
way you -- here,

130
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,580
this shows you the real
and imaginary parts.

131
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,740
That makes it nice.

132
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,390
This shows you the
two coefficients.

133
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,360
That makes it nice.

134
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,160
Can you see stability -- so
what is Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy?

135
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,260
The characteristic
discussion, the argument based

136
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,260
on characteristics, says what?

137
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:34,730
Stability is going
mean that delta t --

138
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,860
stability is going to
happen when r is below 1.

139
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,670
It's just like upwind, except
that r could also be coming --

140
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,560
c could have the opposite sign.

141
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,660
Like Friedrichs
is prepared for c

142
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,960
to be positive or negative,
because it's not purely

143
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,170
upwind or purely downwind.

144
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,170
It's both winds.

145
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:08,720
You see that if r is anywhere
-- the condition is going to be

146
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:17,150
that minus 1 is -- r is
between minus 1 and 1 --

147
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,020
see what's nice about
Friedrichs in that case?

148
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,580
This number is positive.

149
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,930
This number is positive, because
the 1 is bigger than the r.

150
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,610
So each step --
and they add to 1.

151
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,680
So each step takes the new value
as a combination of the two

152
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,330
old values and of
course, the magnitude

153
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,530
can't be bigger than 1.

154
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,200
So under this condition, I
have positive coefficients.

155
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,530
That's positive and
that's positive.

156
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:03,630
They multiply things of absolute
value 1, so they can't --

157
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,620
the sum can't get beyond 1
-- or you might like it here,

158
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,700
that magnitude squared is
cosined squared plus r squared

159
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,300
sine squared, and
if r is below 1,

160
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,890
we're smaller than cosine
squared plus sine squared,

161
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,460
which is 1.

162
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,450
So if I draw the --
just for a moment,

163
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:30,870
if I draw the G in
the complex plane --

164
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,320
so there's the unit circle.
k equals 0 is always there.

165
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,430
That's at 1, then
these points --

166
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:45,270
I think probably those points
fall on an ellipse here,

167
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:54,400
where we go up as high as r, or
magnitude of r, and we go left,

168
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:01,060
right as far as -- this
is k delta x equal pi --

169
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,890
as far as minus 1.

170
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:11,320
So it's stable if
this is less than 1.

171
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,240
Nothing hard.

172
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,080
In fact, easy.

173
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,330
Two positive numbers
that add to 1.

174
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:26,270
Now, I've added a problem
in the problem set.

175
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:31,030
Not requiring it to be turned
in, but just to mention it here

176
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:38,410
-- that whenever the
coefficients are all positive,

177
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,500
the accuracy could
only be first order,

178
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:48,570
so we can't get too far
with positive coefficients.

179
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:53,060
First-order accuracy
is the best possible,

180
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,980
except in the extreme
case when we're

181
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,110
right on the characteristic.

182
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,990
So if r was exactly 1 -- you
remember that special case when

183
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,360
r is exactly 1 and we're
following exactly the line that

184
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,520
carries the true
information -- r is 1.

185
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,730
That's gone and this is just
-- so if r is 1, then U_(j+1,

186
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,980
n) is U -- is this,
is that number,

187
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,570
and we're just carrying
that information exactly.

188
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:30,590
I have to say, again,
that the idea of trying

189
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,520
to follow that characteristic
is a totally natural one

190
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:40,250
and I'm not writing down, here,
a method that tries to do that,

191
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,450
but it wouldn't be a bad
idea in one dimension.

192
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,600
You couldn't do it, really,
well in higher dimensions

193
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,620
where these ideas do
continue to apply.

194
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,904
So that's Lex-Friedrichs.

195
00:13:55,904 --> 00:13:56,820
That's Lex-Friedrichs.

196
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,880
So now, let me turn
to Lax-Wendroff.

197
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:12,740
These are natural ideas, but
Lax and Wendroff did it first.

198
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:20,710
They said, if I use these
three values, all three,

199
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,200
then certainly I can
get the accuracy up

200
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,800
one more because I have one
more coefficient to choose.

201
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:35,460
And to see what they
did, the easiest way

202
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,340
is to write it as
a time difference

203
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,030
on the left to see
how they match.

204
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,650
All they want to do with match
that second term, that delta x

205
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,420
squared term in
the Taylor series.

206
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,680
Because this is going
to give us a d by dt,

207
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,740
this will give us
a d by dx centered,

208
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,480
so we get extra accuracy there,
and the matching that we need

209
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,730
is this term.

210
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,770
Do you recognize that?

211
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,680
What does that term approximate?

212
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,650
Hope I've got it right.

213
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,940
That term approximates
u_xx, right?

214
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,820
So this is -- they've thrown in
a term that approximates u_xx,

215
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:38,660
and its purpose is to catch
the next order of accuracy,

216
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,790
and hopefully not
lose stability,

217
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,090
hopefully remain stable.

218
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:52,050
So what Lax-Wendroff are
doing is staying even closer

219
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:52,890
to this curve.

220
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,870
I guess I have forgotten exactly
what their curve will be.

221
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,010
If I write down G -- Oh, maybe
you could ask MATLAB to do

222
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,160
that.

223
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,080
Write down the G for
this, for Lax-Wendroff --

224
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:20,240
it's got that extra term --
and plot absolute value of G.

225
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,740
I guess you might plot it along
with the Lax-Friedrichs value.

226
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,150
So what am I guessing?

227
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:34,350
I'm pretty sure that
the Lax-Wendroff

228
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,550
one will hug the unit
circle more closely,

229
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,760
but it'll stay inside.

230
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:49,890
So can I just -- Lax-Wendroff
is G closer to 1,

231
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,270
at least for small k,
at least for small k.

232
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,580
That's really where the
accuracy is checked.

233
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,010
How close does these
Taylor series match?

234
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:11,550
Lax-Wendroff match better
and they stay inside.

235
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,170
That takes a little calculation.

236
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:20,120
Took me a while yesterday to
rewrite the -- write out the G,

237
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,750
square the real part, square
the imaginary part, add them up,

238
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,890
and this is what I got.

239
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:29,270
So for Lax-Wendroff,
I got G squared

240
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:37,280
is 1 minus r squared minus
r to the fourth times 1

241
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,250
minus cosine k delta x squared.

242
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:54,350
I put in the notes
eventually, much algebra,

243
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,280
but it does the job.

244
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,250
Because if r squared -- so
what's the stability condition?

245
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,140
It's again this same guy,
the same condition --

246
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,820
r squared below 1.

247
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,490
Again, we could be -- we
could have a left-going wave

248
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,620
and a right-going wave.

249
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,260
Now you'll say, what's
the good of that?

250
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:25,520
Here we just have one
wave, but on Friday, we'll

251
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,760
have a wave going both ways.

252
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,660
So Lax-Friedrichs
and Lax-Wendroff

253
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,390
can both deal with that.

254
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,890
In fact, their stability
conditions are the same

255
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,520
and in fact, you
may be wondering,

256
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,220
why would anybody use
Lax-Friedrichs when

257
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,830
Lax-Wendroff gives
higher accuracy

258
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,110
at no real significant
increase in cost?

259
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,480
So Lax-Wendroff is a favorite.

260
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,020
Don't forget, still,
experiment has

261
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:04,590
to be done to see what it really
does in practice, because right

262
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,350
now, everything's looking
in Lax-Wendroff's favor

263
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,950
with one exception.

264
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:17,200
Lax-Friedrichs, which only
used these two coefficients,

265
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,870
had them positive.

266
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,320
This is positive.

267
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,410
This is positive,
where Lax-Wendroff

268
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,411
is going to have a negative.

269
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:27,910
Let's see.

270
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:32,490
Where will our negative -- I
think there'll be a negative

271
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,420
coefficient in here somewhere.

272
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,110
Probably one of the
three outside guys.

273
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,250
I know that we couldn't have
three positive coefficients

274
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,790
and get up to
second-order accuracy.

275
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,150
Now, where do we pay
the price for that?

276
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,790
Where do we pay the price
-- I should finish here.

277
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,980
Suppose r squared's
bigger than 1.

278
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:08,630
If you accept this calculation,
which has a nice result,

279
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:13,080
but took a while -- if
r squared's below 1,

280
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,990
then what do I know about G?

281
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,730
Suppose r squared's
bigger than 1.

282
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,120
What can we say
from this formula?

283
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,800
Does that hit you right away?

284
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:38,740
G -- if r squared -- this
is certainly -- absolute G.

285
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,470
I've taken the actual G
and squared its real part,

286
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,240
squared its imaginary part, did
all the algebra I could think

287
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,870
of, and got this answer.

288
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,920
For the magnitude squared -- so
the magnitude squared is never

289
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,030
going to go below 0.

290
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,640
I don't have to think of that.

291
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,690
It's just I want to
be sure it's below 1.

292
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,790
So all I really want
to do is be sure

293
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,960
that I'm subtracting
something positive.

294
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,490
Am I subtracting
something positive?

295
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,190
That's certainly positive.

296
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,310
Is this positive?

297
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,970
r squared'll be bigger
than r to the fourth.

298
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,290
If r squared's less than
1, then r to the fourth

299
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,040
is even smaller.

300
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,000
So this is positive,
this is positive.

301
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,460
I'm subtracting something, so G
is certainly not bigger than 1.

302
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:45,460
So that formula really
makes it evident

303
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,310
and I guess also
evident that we're

304
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,390
getting some high accuracy.

305
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:58,620
You see, what's the size
of this when k is small?

306
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:05,950
When k is small, if I'm taking
the cosine of a small angle --

307
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,860
what am I looking at there?

308
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,200
If this is a small angle theta,
I'm looking at 1 minus cosine

309
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,050
theta -- that's of what order?

310
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,550
Theta squared.

311
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,410
Theta squared.

312
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,307
Then that's squared again,
so that I'm up to theta

313
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:26,890
to the fourth.

314
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,360
That's why I'm getting
off to a good start.

315
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:41,780
So stability we've got,
two-sided we've got,

316
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:48,900
experiment -- can I just try to
draw a little graph of what I

317
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:58,610
think the two methods will
do for our model problem?

318
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:04,580
Like this model problem
of a wave moving along?

319
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:15,190
I want to try to draw it
at, let's say, t equal to 1,

320
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,860
for example.

321
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,980
So at t equal 1, the
wave should be here.

322
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,630
I'll draw -- you might say
this is totally unsatisfactory,

323
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:37,961
and it is, because I'm just
drawing by hand what you can

324
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:38,460
see.

325
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,540
Maybe you should.

326
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,220
This would be a perfect
experiment and I really could

327
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:49,370
use, for the notes -- the
notes could use a proper graph.

328
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,870
I think what you
see -- let's see.

329
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:59,440
At t equal 1, both methods
are going to be 0 way out here

330
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,690
and they'll be 1 way out here.

331
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,610
Why's that?

332
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,980
Because the signal
speed is finite, right?

333
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:13,230
This way out here, it hasn't
heard about this wave of water.

334
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,770
Way out here, it doesn't know
that it's not a constant.

335
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:24,040
The question is, and I guess
the thing has moved, so maybe --

336
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,880
can I try roughly?

337
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,010
So the true wall of
water would be that.

338
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,490
I think that what Lax-Wendroff
-- Lax-Friedrichs --

339
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:42,300
so Lax-Friedrichs, with
positive coefficients,

340
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:51,470
will show a smooth profile,
but the perfect signal will get

341
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,990
spread out.

342
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,890
The perfect signal
will get spread out.

343
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,000
Why is that?

344
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,860
Let me just draw a
spread out signal.

345
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,780
So apologies to do this by hand.

346
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,830
I think it's probably going
to be pretty centered,

347
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,290
but it's going to be spread out.

348
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,840
So that, I think, would
be Lax-Friedrichs.

349
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,330
That's very rough, right?

350
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:25,130
But I really -- hearty thanks
for anybody who gives me a code

351
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:34,600
that does it and graphs it.

352
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,370
But the main point is, we
have a lot of smearing here.

353
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:44,040
The accuracy is not
going to be terrific.

354
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,740
But there isn't any bumpiness.

355
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,320
The reason there's no bumpiness
is that we're Lax-Freidrichs

356
00:25:53,320 --> 00:26:03,030
with -- has these
positive coefficients,

357
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,600
so that every value always
has to stay between 0 and 1.

358
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,140
The starting values
were between 0 and 1.

359
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,890
At every step, the values
are between 0 and 1,

360
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,830
because we're always
taking a combination

361
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:21,240
of a positive
multiple of one value

362
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,000
and another positive
multiple of the other value

363
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,800
and the two coefficients
adding to one.

364
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,840
We're taking 30% of one and
70% of another and we never --

365
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,290
we're always in between
the 0 and the 1.

366
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:41,000
What about Lax-Wendroff?

367
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,810
What are you expecting
for Lax-Wendroff?

368
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:48,540
Expecting better
accuracy, expecting --

369
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,090
if I were on the ball,
I'd have another color.

370
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:59,870
Lax-Wendroff will be a much
better profile, sharper

371
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:07,390
profile, but you know what
the price is going to be?

372
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,900
There'll be some oscillation.

373
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,770
There'll be some oscillations
behind -- I think behind --

374
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,300
oh gosh, I should know.

375
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:22,150
Forgive me for -- I can fix
these if you'll tell me how,

376
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,400
on the next -- because
I'm not sure that --

377
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,499
I should know whether
they're at both --

378
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:30,540
or whether the oscillations
happens at both ends.

379
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,920
I doubt it.

380
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,790
No, I doubt it.

381
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,300
I don't think it will.

382
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,560
Why do I not think it well?

383
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,900
Because in Lax-Wendroff,
the three coefficients --

384
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,670
one of them will be negative
and two will be positive.

385
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,680
They'll add to 1, of course.

386
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,840
So the oscillations,
which are coming

387
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,090
from sometimes a negative
coefficient, sometimes

388
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,340
a positive, will
all be on one side.

389
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:05,700
So only one of those
oscillations [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

390
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:12,270
So this is my picture of --
can I -- of Lax-Wendroff,

391
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:31,080
with oscillations
behind the wave front.

392
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,790
All right.

393
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,310
If you've done any
computing, you,

394
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,890
when you see these
oscillations, you immediately

395
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:43,650
think of somebody's
name, which is Gibbs.

396
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,400
Of course, Gibbs -- do you
remember the Gibbs phenomenon

397
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,650
that comes when you're
approximating a square wave,

398
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:57,240
like there, by pure
Fourier series?

399
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,490
So the Gibbs, the classical
Gibbs phenomenon is,

400
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,980
take the Fourier series
for a square wave -- well,

401
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:09,680
it's smooth -- and then
truncate that series,

402
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,690
cut that series off at
100 terms or 1,000 terms.

403
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:20,240
Gibbs noticed -- and
it's always a problem --

404
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:30,350
that these oscillations
appear right near the front.

405
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:36,360
So, far away, no
problem, but here we

406
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,650
really see it only on one
side, because we're not

407
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,130
doing Gibbs' Fourier
series experiment.

408
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,790
We're doing Lax-Wendroff
wave equation.

409
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,220
When I say we, I really
hope you'll do it

410
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:55,240
and a few lines of MATLAB
will be greatly appreciated.

411
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:02,940
Maybe Mr. Cho can -- you could
email to him, for example,

412
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,680
a code and the plot.

413
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,950
So what does that tell us?

414
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:15,350
Tells us Lax-Wendroff has
got a lot of potential,

415
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:20,140
but this oscillation isn't good.

416
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,530
How are you going
to get rid of it?

417
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,010
How do you get rid of bumpiness?

418
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,450
You introduce diffusion.

419
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:43,610
So diffusion, heat equation
stuff smooth things out.

420
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,170
Wave equations don't
smooth things out.

421
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:51,280
This wall of water in the wave
equation stayed a sharp wall.

422
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,880
But we'll see very soon in
the heat equation, diffusion,

423
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,810
viscosity, all those
physical things

424
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:04,570
connect, numerically,
to a smoother solution,

425
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,920
smoother profile.

426
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:13,280
So that is really a key
idea, is -- and we'll see it,

427
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,880
but it will make the
problem not linear.

428
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,760
If we want to stay
with a linear equation

429
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,890
and increase the accuracy,
we're going to get oscillation.

430
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,670
But if we locate
the oscillation,

431
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:33,200
introduce some diffusion
in the right place,

432
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,070
we can reduce the oscillation.

433
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:43,480
So that's where -- this is what
you really have to do if you

434
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:50,370
want good output from
numerical methods.

435
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,920
Even on this simple
model problem,

436
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:59,950
you'll have to have this
idea of numerical viscosity.

437
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,340
Artificial viscosity,
numerical diffusion

438
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,710
popped in at the right spot.

439
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,670
So we'll see that.

440
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:12,460
Maybe the right place to see it
will be for when the equation

441
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,330
itself is already nonlinear.

442
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,720
That's where it has
developed a lot.

443
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,810
So we'll -- when we get to
nonlinear wave equations,

444
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:26,910
which isn't far off,
that's what we'll see.

445
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:36,830
So now, I guess I have one
more topic in this lecture.

446
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,620
That is convergence.

447
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:45,280
How do you show that -- we know,
we sort of know that we need

448
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,860
stability.

449
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,780
So I guess I'm going
to have to come

450
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,870
to the question of convergence.

451
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,570
All right.

452
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:59,310
And of course, I have to
mention -- more than mention --

453
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:08,970
the key result in the whole
theory, the connection --

454
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,790
so we have methods that are
first order or second order --

455
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:18,810
stable or unstable, and then the
key idea is this Lax -- again,

456
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,340
he enters -- Lax equivalency.

457
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,410
So this is a little bit of
pure math, comes into this,

458
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:36,690
and it gives exactly the
result we would expect.

459
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:48,450
Stability implies
convergence and convergence

460
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,770
implies stability.

461
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,690
So that's the two
ideas are equivalent,

462
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:57,770
provided we're talking
about a decent problem,

463
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:12,980
for a consistent approximation
to well-posed problems.

464
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,780
I've got four words on the
board, four keywords here.

465
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,180
Stability, we kind of
know what that means.

466
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,360
Convergence.

467
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,330
These are the new words and
I'll just -- and actually --

468
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:38,190
so consistent means that the
method is at least first order

469
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:43,210
and that the difference equation
approaches the differential

470
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:48,150
equation at a single step.

471
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,690
Well-posed means that the
differential equation is OK.

472
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,730
So, for example, what would
be a non-well-posed problem?

473
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,630
When we get to
the heat equation,

474
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:09,210
if you ran the heat
equation backward in time,

475
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:15,262
that would give us an
equation du/dt as minus u_xx.

476
00:35:15,262 --> 00:35:16,470
That would be not well-posed.

477
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,570
That would be not well-posed.

478
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:26,250
Or, if you tried to solve
Laplace's equation equation --

479
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:35,862
say, u_tt plus u_xx equals
0 -- from initial values,

480
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:37,070
that would not be well-posed.

481
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,700
But we're dealing with
well-posed problems.

482
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:48,540
The wave equation, which has
the right sign< and the heat

483
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,120
equation with the right sign.

484
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,010
So our problems are
going to be well-posed.

485
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:55,210
You can safely think
we're only talking

486
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:59,160
about consistent approximations
to well-posed problems.

487
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,250
Here is the main point.

488
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,250
Stability holds if and only
if the convergence holds.

489
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,960
So there's actually two
things to show there.

490
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,780
How does stability
give convergence?

491
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,990
Why does convergence
require stability?

492
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:21,730
So that instability could
not [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

493
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:26,430
So that's sort of maybe
the fundamental theorem

494
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,540
of numerical analysis.

495
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:37,990
The fact that stability, a --
we better say what stability is,

496
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,470
and what is convergence.

497
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:49,310
So let me capture
these in inequalities,

498
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:54,190
in mathematical terms
rather than just words.

499
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,380
So those are the ideas -- maybe
I'm going to have to write

500
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:07,820
a little above here, but -- so
what does -- what's our method?

501
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,340
So I need some notation and
then I'll lift the board

502
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,890
and we'll see what
each thing means.

503
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:19,250
So our method, we're allowing
any difference method

504
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,630
that moves forward in time.

505
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,490
There's time.

506
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:31,540
Let me use R for the
true operator that

507
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,870
takes the function, follows
the differential equation

508
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,600
to the next time.

509
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:43,810
So I'm going to say that true
u, which is always a small u,

510
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:50,020
at delta t is some R,
something R times u of t,

511
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:59,680
where the approximate guy
is some s times U of t.

512
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,230
So R is the true solution.

513
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,230
So well-posed.

514
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:09,420
So of course to take --
if this is n delta t,

515
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:16,582
then we've taken R n times,
so the true solution is R

516
00:38:16,582 --> 00:38:19,540
to the n-th times
the initial value,

517
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:26,570
and the approximate guy is
S^n times the initial value

518
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:32,420
and we'll -- we might as well
start out with those the same.

519
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,300
So that's what R and S are.

520
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:40,150
Now, we got three ideas here.

521
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,470
What does well-posed mean?

522
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:54,230
Well-posed means that the
true thing is bounded.

523
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:59,730
That R to the n-th times u is
less than some constant times

524
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:00,230
u.

525
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,620
These inequalities
are sort of part

526
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:16,330
of the mathematics of partial
differential equations.

527
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:25,210
I think you've got to take
them as not -- I mean,

528
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,720
take them as sort of a
reasonable statement that

529
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,980
the -- this is energy, this
u typically will measure

530
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,310
the energy.

531
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:39,280
And in our wave equation,
C_1, the constant C_1 will be?

532
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,160
1.

533
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,800
The energy doesn't change.

534
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,730
In another problem, we could
allow the possibility of C_1

535
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:53,670
being a little bigger than
1, but think of C_1 as 1.

536
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:07,160
Then, stability will be a
bound on S to the n, say, C_2.

537
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,730
And again, in our
example, C_2 has been 1.

538
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:22,390
This is like -- C_2
is like -- I mean,

539
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,310
S to the n-th on each
exponential is this G

540
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:29,560
to the n-th, and G is below 1.

541
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,920
So often, C_1 and C_2 will be 1.

542
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:41,810
Then finally, what is
this ideas of consistency?

543
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:47,130
And this means --
consistent means that --

544
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,320
so what's consistency?

545
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:56,000
Consistent is comparing
the differential equation

546
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,190
with the difference equation.

547
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:05,160
It's comparing R with
S and at a single step,

548
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,820
they should be close.

549
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:15,410
So at a single step, R
minus S u, that's the --

550
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:19,070
starting with the same u,
I'm just taking one step

551
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:22,180
in the differential equation
and comparing it with one step

552
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:27,040
in the difference equation --
and I would want that to be

553
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,810
C_3, maybe delta
t to the p plus 1.

554
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:43,100
Was that -- is that --
times size of u, I think.

555
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:47,060
Order delta t to the p plus 1.

556
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,480
Like delta t squared.

557
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:59,250
This would be the usual
situation, that --

558
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,710
when it's stable.

559
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:06,840
So at the moment then, I want
to say, if these are all true,

560
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,490
then I get
convergence because --

561
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:13,270
what I'm now going to do is
show that stability implies

562
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,280
convergence.

563
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,740
It's what we did for ordinary
differential equations.

564
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,720
This was the local error.

565
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,090
This is the local error that I
called DE, the discreditization

566
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:29,710
error.

567
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:34,040
These are saying -- so
this is saying that the --

568
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,290
here's really what happens.

569
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:41,320
So I want to look at the
error up here after n steps.

570
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,710
So the error after n
steps -- typical term is,

571
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,430
I follow the
differential equation.

572
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,250
That's u.

573
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,470
Then I have this
little error DE,

574
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:59,410
which I make at that step, the
difference between R and S,

575
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:05,110
and then I follow the
difference equation

576
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:08,190
up to the remaining time.

577
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:14,660
What I want to show is
that I can track the error

578
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:19,650
and bound it.

579
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,010
I don't know if you
remember the discussion

580
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,910
for ordinary
differential equations,

581
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,680
but it went the same way.

582
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,220
We had -- we looked at the
new error DE that was produced

583
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,950
at each time step k.

584
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:39,880
When we took k steps of -- when
we got up to this point with

585
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,810
the true solution, we
plugged the true solution

586
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:47,810
into the difference equation, it
had a little error and whatever

587
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:51,940
error there was, that got
thrown in with other errors

588
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:56,840
and propagated up
to any later time n.

589
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,270
Am I bringing back what
we did there, or just --

590
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:07,180
you can just see that's what
we're going to have here.

591
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,630
Now, how will I express that?

592
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,840
Somehow, I have to estimate
the difference between R

593
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,930
to the n-th and S to the n-th.

594
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,890
That's really my problem.

595
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,230
Actually, it's a nice problem.

596
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,770
Suppose I have control
of powers of R and S,

597
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:34,220
and I know that R minus
S is small somehow.

598
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,580
How do I show that R to the n-th
minus S to the n-th is small?

599
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,990
That's my job.

600
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:45,780
This is the error when I apply
it to a starting value u.

601
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,070
This is the difference
between little u and big U.

602
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:54,730
So how do I -- what I want to
do is split it out into this

603
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,320
situation where I just
have one R minus S.

604
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,800
I think this'll work.

605
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,870
So suppose I have -- I think
I could start with R to the n

606
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:13,150
minus 1 times R minus S, and
then an R to the n minus 2

607
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:20,230
times an R minus S times an
S. Maybe I don't -- sorry,

608
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:23,730
this guy is going to carry
and I'd rather do -- sorry.

609
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:31,300
Got to do it right, because
I want the R's to come first.

610
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:44,470
I want maybe R minus S times
S to the n minus 1 and then --

611
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:45,470
sorry.

612
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:48,580
I want R's on the right.

613
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,580
Good.

614
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,170
Finally got it.

615
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,570
So that gives me the R of the
n-th, but I've subtracted off,

616
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:13,920
so I need an S R minus S R
to the n minus 2 and so on.

617
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,090
Sorry for this bit of algebra in
the middle of practical things,

618
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:25,790
but do you see that this is
the case where I followed

619
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:28,680
the differential equation
up and at the last step

620
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,760
I made an error?

621
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,110
This is the case where I
followed the differential

622
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,750
equation almost to the
top, I made an error

623
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:41,380
and then I had one more step
to go with the difference.

624
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,840
The S is doing this
part, so a typical term

625
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:50,420
will be a power of S, S
to some power, R minus S,

626
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,270
R to some power.

627
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:56,930
I'm breaking the
error at n steps

628
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:01,810
into n different terms, each
from the error at one step.

629
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:03,870
This is the error
at the last step,

630
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:07,270
this is the error at the
next-to-last step, and so on.

631
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:09,970
We've got it.

632
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:13,430
Because I just
estimate every term,

633
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:18,060
every term has a power of
R, which gives me a C_1;

634
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,630
a power of S, which
gives me a C_2;

635
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:24,600
and the discreditization error,
the one-step actual error,

636
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,410
R minus S, which gives me
a C_3; and this delta t

637
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,380
to the p plus 1.

638
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:37,960
You see that I'm just
piling up n of these,

639
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,470
so I'm getting n of those,
delta t to the p plus 1,

640
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:46,770
so the final result will be,
I'll have n of these delta t

641
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:53,260
to the p plus 1's and that
will be T -- n delta t --

642
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,230
delta t to the p.

643
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,280
So that'll be the error.

644
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,770
Since I went to all
the trouble of defining

645
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:06,540
a C_1, C_2, and C_3,
those three numbers.

646
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:10,990
So the error -- there'll be
a C_1 times C_2 times C_3

647
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:16,830
constant there, in the bound.

648
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:20,310
Have a look at
the notes for that

649
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:27,380
and let me just conclude
with Lax's insight

650
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,380
on the other part.

651
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:34,970
The fact that convergence
requires stability.

652
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,250
So you see, what I've shown
is that if we're stable,

653
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,330
if I bound these, bound
these, bound these,

654
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,310
then I have a
bound on the error.

655
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,500
That's convergence.

656
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,830
The other way is,
if it's unstable,

657
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,220
how do you know it
couldn't converge?

658
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,970
How do we know that
convergence requires stability?

659
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:03,240
It's a little
delicate, so I just --

660
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,810
this is the last 30
seconds of the lecture,

661
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:13,310
just to mention this point,
because it's easy to miss a key

662
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:15,510
point here.

663
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:19,605
We've tracked a different -- now
I'm supposing that the method

664
00:49:19,605 --> 00:49:23,920
is unstable and I want to
show that it will fail, right?

665
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,280
That's my job now.

666
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,740
That's Lax's -- other
half of Lax's theorem:

667
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,010
If it's unstable,
the method will fail.

668
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:36,040
There'll be some initial
value for which it blows up.

669
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,130
Now you might say, that initial
value is just e to the i*k*x.

670
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:44,460
But, we didn't
follow this point,

671
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:50,830
but if I take an e to the i*k*x
where G is bigger than 1 --

672
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:53,950
of course, that is
getting amplified a bit,

673
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,640
but for that particular
e to the i*k*x,

674
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,520
when delta t decreases --
so if I have a -- you see,

675
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,210
this is a k delta x.

676
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,890
What I'm trying to say
is that for a fixed k,

677
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:10,110
even an unstable
method can work.

678
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:14,640
For a fixed frequency k,
as delta t and delta x gets

679
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,720
smaller -- these guys, whether
they're outside or inside,

680
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,600
will be coming down toward
1 and if you're patient,

681
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,780
you could see it
actually worked.

682
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:32,760
So it's -- somehow, the initial
function that doesn't work,

683
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,800
that blows up, is a
combination of frequencies.

684
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,810
A single frequency, actually,
you move down here and it's not

685
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:45,700
catastrophic in the end, but
a combination of frequencies,

686
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,740
so that as one
frequency moves down,

687
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,000
another one is moving
into this position,

688
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,680
another one into this -- there
is a typical initial function

689
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,140
and it is disaster.

690
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:02,750
So that's what Lax had to catch.

691
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:08,500
The notes will use the single
word, uniform boundedness.

692
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:13,220
Anyway, this is one
point where pure math --

693
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:19,920
a kind of neat result in pure
math says that if stability

694
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:27,790
fails, then there is some single
starting value on which it will

695
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,730
fail.

696
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:32,520
That starting value won't
be a pure e to the i*k*x,

697
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:39,410
because it, as we said, actually
in the end gets to be OK,

698
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:42,640
but there will be a combination
of frequencies that'll fail

699
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,850
and so convergence will fail.

700
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:49,010
So that's the key theorem.

701
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,300
I probably won't use
the word theorem again,

702
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,470
but this is one time
when it's justified

703
00:51:55,470 --> 00:52:04,340
and when a little sort of
abstract functional analysis

704
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:09,890
gives the conclusion that
convergence requires stability.

705
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:12,670
So you'll see that in
the notes and next time,

706
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:18,440
we move on to the true wave
equation, second order.

707
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,690
Thanks.
