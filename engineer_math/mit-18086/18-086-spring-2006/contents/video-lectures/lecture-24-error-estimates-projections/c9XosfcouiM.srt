7
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:15,980
PROFESSOR: OK.

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,500
Ready for today's
discussion, which

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,940
I'm quite sort of happy about.

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,180
I hadn't really
seen this coming.

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,720
First, we haven't said
anything about how

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,730
do you estimate the
error in a problem.

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:40,070
Because we're often taking a
continuous problem coming from

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:47,720
a differential equation,
typically, and discretizing it,

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,040
and solving it -- solving
the discrete problem.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,070
And we want some idea.

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,600
It's not just some math
question of course,

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:03,470
because, you know, in
engineering design or analysis,

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,670
an idea of what the
error is critical.

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,690
And secondly, it
gives us an idea

21
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,730
of where we can improve it.

22
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:17,340
You know, if we see what's
controlling the error then

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,830
we know what's going on.

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:29,170
So I'm speaking now about
steady-state problems.

25
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,130
We discussed error for
initial value problems,

26
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,590
and we realized there that
the error depended on --

27
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,720
usually finite differences.

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,280
So the error we knew
we could figure out

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,490
locally from the finite
difference that we chose.

30
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,400
You know, we chose second
order accurate differences

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,550
frequently, but we could've
moved up to fourth.

32
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,140
And then the other
ingredient you

33
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,230
need is stability, to know
that those local errors don't

34
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,400
explode as time goes forward.

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,900
OK.

36
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,380
So we had something to say
about error and accuracy

37
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,650
at that time about that topic.

38
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,730
And now I'm realizing that
many of our other topic

39
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,250
fall in this category.

40
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,820
And I put three of
the topics here.

41
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:30,110
In the idea sort of where the
underlying discretization is

42
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,530
a projection.

43
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,720
It's somehow a projection
between the true solution

44
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,470
and the discrete,
computed solution.

45
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,700
Somehow the discrete,
computed solution

46
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,430
is in some finite-dimensional
family where we can compute,

47
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,080
and we're projecting
into that family.

48
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,464
And here are three examples.

49
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,630
So you'll see that, actually,
what I'm talking about

50
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,650
is central to the
whole semester.

51
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:08,970
Well, finite elements actually
appeared more in 18.085.

52
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,800
So I'll have to recap
a little bit there.

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,720
But they would be
the natural tool

54
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,100
for solving that list
of continuous problems

55
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,980
from calculus of variations
that I talked about last time,

56
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:27,160
minimizing some energy, where
the energy is, typically,

57
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,870
an integral and we're
in the continuous case.

58
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,180
And what's the finite
element central idea?

59
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,310
It is choose these guys,
choose some basis functions,

60
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,280
and look at their combinations.

61
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,160
Maybe choose N basis functions.

62
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,410
I guess I better
get a chalk or it's

63
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,860
going to be a short lecture.

64
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,360
OK.

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,420
So we have a continuous
problem, continuous ODE,

66
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,420
ordinary differential equation
or a partial differential

67
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,170
equation, with boundary
conditions, as always,

68
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,870
that we want to make discrete.

69
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,800
And the point is I am
not making a discrete

70
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,440
by finite differences.

71
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,170
This is a different route
from finite differences.

72
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:28,330
And in Laplace's equation and
these, in many, many problems,

73
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,050
this is the preferred route.

74
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,870
And finite elements
are a particular choice

75
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,210
of these guys.

76
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,675
The Galerkin idea -- so I'll use
his name for the overall idea

77
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:48,160
-- is choose these, and look
for the best combination,

78
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,890
and we have to say
what does best mean.

79
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,190
Well, best is going to mean --
in our minimization problems,

80
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,730
it will be the combination
that gives the minimum.

81
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,760
The combination of
these n trial functions.

82
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,290
Now the exact
solution is not going

83
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,170
to be in that little
n-dimensional space.

84
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,660
Those functions
for finite elements

85
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,080
might be piecewise linear,
or if you want to upgrade it,

86
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,270
they might be
piecewise parabolas,

87
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,790
piecewise cubics, whatever.

88
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,240
That was the brilliant
finite element idea,

89
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,030
to choose simple functions.

90
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,080
And then you could
take N quite large,

91
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,490
but you're still not getting
the exact solution of course,

92
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,850
and it's to estimate
how far off you are.

93
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,900
But then also in multigrid,
what was the idea in multigrid?

94
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,600
We started with a
system at level h.

95
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,830
We started with some
problem A_h*u_h equal f_h,

96
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,730
which was a big system.

97
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,500
If we did ordinary
Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel,

98
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,220
that was too slow.

99
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,970
The multigrid idea
was project, there's

100
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,940
that magic word project,
onto to a coarse grid,

101
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,420
where the problem is smaller.

102
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,540
Here, we started with
a continuous problem,

103
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,890
and we got it down
to size N. Here we

104
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,780
start with a discrete
problem and we

105
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,610
cut its size in half or in
quarter or in eighth, again.

106
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,750
So projection is producing
a smaller problem,

107
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,580
and the question is
what are you losing?

108
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,330
And actually
conjugate gradients.

109
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,520
You remember these spaces?

110
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,400
The spaces span the
combinations of b, A*b,

111
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,840
A squared b and so on.

112
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,750
That was the computationally
convenient subspace

113
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,600
to project onto.

114
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:14,730
And so we've got
important examples.

115
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,300
Now what I realized,
I'm pleased about this,

116
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,810
is that they all fit.

117
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,440
So here's my problem,
what's the error?

118
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,010
So I'm going to u star
for the correct answer.

119
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,620
This is the true.

120
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,320
And I'm going to use U
star, capital U star,

121
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,360
for the approximate,
the one that we

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:51,680
get by any of those key
ideas in numerical analysis.

123
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,170
And I'm trying to
estimate the difference.

124
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,100
OK.

125
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,220
And I just put up
here that I'm dealing

126
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,260
with positive definite problems.

127
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,640
In fact, the matrix K, the
symmetric positive definite

128
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,740
problem you have, often has
this A transposed C*A form,

129
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,830
or in the continuous
case, K might stand for --

130
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,480
the A transpose might
be minus the derivative;

131
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,150
the C might be a
variable or constant,

132
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:31,510
the physical coefficient;
A would be d by dx,

133
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,460
that would be the K thing.

134
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,470
The equation I want
to get is K*u equal f.

135
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,080
That's the strong form.

136
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,930
Strong form will be K*u equal f.

137
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,920
But the whole point of
last lecture and this one

138
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,410
is that we don't get
to the strong form.

139
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,040
This projection starts
with a minimum problem,

140
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,090
and gets to a weak form.

141
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,830
And it's the minimum
problem or the weak form

142
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,130
that we want to think
about, not the strong form.

143
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,150
OK.

144
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,490
Now.

145
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,120
Up there I wrote an identity.

146
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,240
If you just multiply
that right hand side out,

147
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,790
I believe it comes out right.

148
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:29,370
And it's very valuable
for our purposes here.

149
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,290
OK.

150
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,630
So what's on the left side?

151
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,310
This is the quantity
that we're minimizing,

152
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:42,520
we're minimizing this.

153
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,930
And by just manipulation,
we wrote it this way.

154
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,320
So now I can identify
what u star is.

155
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,030
So I'm going to minimize
this over all u.

156
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,040
That certainly looks like
a discrete problem, right?

157
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,040
So think of u as a
vector, f as a vector,

158
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,270
K as a positive definite
symmetric matrix.

159
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,820
Just think about that.

160
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:23,150
But I want it to apply very
much to the continuous case

161
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,980
too, to differential equations.

162
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,640
But here's a point
then, what's the winner?

163
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,780
You can't immediately see --
well maybe you can, somehow,

164
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,870
see that when I set the
derivative of this thing to 0,

165
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,970
I get that equation.

166
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:46,280
You can kind of believe it, even
if it's vectors and matrices.

167
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,240
But here you can see
right away that --

168
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,460
how do I make this small?

169
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,050
This is a constant here.

170
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,830
That's just a constant,
so it doesn't depend on u.

171
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,880
So what choice of u
makes that term small?

172
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,290
Well of course it's
the choice of u

173
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,190
is the one that makes this
thing 0, because that's

174
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,850
a positive definite matrix.

175
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,800
No way anything is going
to get negative here.

176
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,320
This is a something
transposed K something.

177
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,380
You remember what
positive definite means.

178
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:32,660
It means that x transpose
K*x, for every vector x,

179
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,740
is never negative.

180
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,680
So the best we could
do would be to bring

181
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,920
this to 0, and of
course to bring it to 0

182
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,410
is to bring the x to 0,
to bring this thing to 0,

183
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,580
so this thing should be 0.

184
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,700
So u minus K inverse
f should be 0.

185
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,810
And of course, that leads us
back to the same conclusion

186
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,930
that we reached from
the -- the strong form.

187
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,950
OK.

188
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,310
Good.

189
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,870
So that an identity,
but now I want

190
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:08,010
to use this identity to answer
the question about what if I

191
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,200
minimize only on a subspace?

192
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,700
That's the problem for today.

193
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,270
So that's a question.

194
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,670
Maybe I'll write it
on this fresh board.

195
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,870
Now I minimize only
over some subspace.

196
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:27,290
Now can I can I use
capital U for the --

197
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:34,530
I used little u for, in here,
allowing it to be any vector,

198
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,450
and I found a winner.

199
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:42,610
And let me give the
winner a name, u star.

200
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:50,800
It's a real headache in
this subject of what --

201
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,500
just the notation.

202
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,540
What should we call the winner?

203
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,200
So sometimes I
call it u hat, that

204
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,780
was a familiar notation
in estimation theory,

205
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,210
least squares.

206
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,990
Today I'm going
to call it u star.

207
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,100
So it's u star is the
winner, small u star.

208
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:21,910
Let me take time-out, one minute
time-out, on a board -- I mean,

209
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,490
optimization is about the
problem of minimizing some

210
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:31,356
function F of x.

211
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:32,730
I'm just going to
take one minute

212
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,940
on the problems of an author.

213
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,830
What do you call the winning
function, winning vector,

214
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,416
or the winning x?

215
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,790
I mean it could
be just a scalar,

216
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,160
we could be doing just calculus.

217
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,620
What do I call the x
that gives the minimum?

218
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,960
You may have a favorite,
you can't call it x right?

219
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,520
I mean, because that's
just confusing it

220
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,990
with the variable x.

221
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,380
So I'm saying, well,
you could call it x hat,

222
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:10,440
you could call it x star,
you call it capital X.

223
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,600
So I'll just write a
few of those down --

224
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,930
x star would be a possibility,
x hat would be a possibility,

225
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,420
x minimizing would
be a possibility.

226
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,890
I'm doing this
just because I want

227
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,220
to write down the thing
that you often see,

228
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:34,750
which is argmin of F of x.

229
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,990
And I write that down just
so that if you ever see it,

230
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,460
you know what the heck it means.

231
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,270
It has the same meaning
as any of these.

232
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,240
I am not a big fan of that.

233
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,150
But what does this mean?

234
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:57,960
It means the argument that gives
the minimum of F of x, right.

235
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:04,630
Argument is a fancy word for
the variable in the function.

236
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,780
So this says the
argument that gives

237
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,680
the minimum of F
of x, and that's

238
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,530
what we're looking for to name.

239
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:17,290
But I'm sure not happy about
writing that name down.

240
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:23,590
So here it goes, it disappears.

241
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,130
But you'll see it, and
now you now want it means.

242
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,100
OK.

243
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:36,230
So this is now the
central issue here.

244
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:45,880
I want to minimize my same guy,
1/2 u transpose K*u minus u

245
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,120
transpose f.

246
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,640
Or, which is exactly the same,
that same right-hand side,

247
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,030
because the two are equal,
I want to minimize over some

248
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,150
capital U's, not all U's.

249
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,510
If I minimize over all U's,
then I get the exact answer.

250
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,380
But the idea of all
these numerical methods

251
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,370
is minimize over some
finite-dimensional,

252
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,100
smaller-dimensional,
subspace of trial functions.

253
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
I don't know.

254
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,770
I'll say minimize over
U in the trial space,

255
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,260
just to write it out in words.

256
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:24,760
OK.

257
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,900
Well, now I guess my name for
the winner in the trial space

258
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,810
is going to be U star.

259
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:48,810
So the winner in the trial
space will be U star.

260
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,920
So that's my finite element
solution, my conjugate gradient

261
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,190
solution, my multigrid solution.

262
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:04,230
All these problems are reducing
to a smaller trial space,

263
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,010
and picking the winner there,
computing the winner there.

264
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:14,760
And then the question of today
is how far apart are the two?

265
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,700
OK.

266
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,930
And now there's
this little formula

267
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,790
that gives us a good idea.

268
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,000
This little formula gives
us a handle on that.

269
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:34,940
So now, the point is -- So now,
can I look at this formula?

270
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,290
Maybe maybe I'll copy
the formula here.

271
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:44,790
This is the minimum over all
these trial guys, of 1/2 -- oh,

272
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:50,040
but I'm going to write
it that way -- 1/2 U,

273
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,250
that's my trial guy,
minus K inverse f,

274
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,380
that's my u star now.

275
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,530
Am I OK to give that
name to K inverse f?

276
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,410
Yeah, I already gave it, I
guess. u star is K inverse f.

277
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,331
So that's cool.

278
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:04,830
Shorter.

279
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,530
It's shorter and better.

280
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:15,400
K -- or its transpose -- U
minus u star plus a constant.

281
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,470
So I can forget that.

282
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,130
I can forget this constant part.

283
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:27,400
That's not important to us.

284
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,500
So this simple identity
then has expressed

285
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:45,820
our key discretization
approach here as finding the U,

286
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,720
and we're going to call it U
star, that's nearest to u star.

287
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:58,361
That's the great fact that makes
the whole subject pleasant.

288
00:18:58,361 --> 00:18:58,860
OK.

289
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:04,160
So the winner U star
is then, by this,

290
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,570
since I'm minimizing
that expression,

291
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:16,510
it's certainly the
nearest in the K norm --

292
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:23,090
it's the nearest weighted by
K, somehow that K is important.

293
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:30,090
That K is reflecting the
problem we're solving.

294
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:38,490
That K is the energy or
whatever -- to U star.

295
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,210
OK.

296
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,940
That's the great conclusion.

297
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,880
You could say that's
the fundamental theorem

298
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:51,700
of this projection, error
estimates and stuff.

299
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,110
So do you see that
we got to that?

300
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,130
The thing that minimizes
makes this as small as we can.

301
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:04,340
So nearest is simply a
translation of what that says.

302
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,840
Pick the capital U
that's closest to u star.

303
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,770
OK.

304
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,710
Now how does that help?

305
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,440
That helps because I want
to estimate the difference.

306
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:26,950
So now I estimate the difference
of U star minus u star.

307
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,010
So I'm trying to get a handle
on how different those are.

308
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:44,420
How different is the -- so let
me take, in this case of, say,

309
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:49,910
Laplace's equation or
the 1D case -- again,

310
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,560
I'm speaking steady-state
boundary value problem.

311
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,150
So U star is the best
combination of these trial

312
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:05,440
functions, capital U, and little
u star is the exact solution.

313
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,480
Let me draw a picture.

314
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,600
So suppose I'm in 1D, 0 to 1.

315
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,100
OK.

316
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,280
Yeah, let me pick that
model problem again.

317
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:29,560
So minus the derivative
of c*du/dx is f of x.

318
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:35,040
With boundary conditions.

319
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,870
And I guess if I'm consistent
now, I should write u star,

320
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,180
because it's the
winning solution.

321
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,630
And suppose the boundary
conditions are 0 at both ends,

322
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,150
and it does something.

323
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,990
OK.

324
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,970
So that's u star.

325
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,270
OK.

326
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,020
So that's a
continuous case, which

327
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,500
I'm drawing a picture
to represent what

328
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,170
the solution might look like.

329
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:03,890
OK.

330
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,160
Now what about this
finite element stuff?

331
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:14,450
Suppose the phi_i's
are linear pieces.

332
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:20,450
I'm going to do linear
finite element method.

333
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,610
Then any combination
of these linear guys

334
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,810
is going to be piecewise linear,
there's going to be a mesh.

335
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,200
You know the set-up.

336
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,940
It might look like that,
and have a value there.

337
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,050
It might have a value
there, might have a value

338
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,710
there, there, there, and there.

339
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,770
OK.

340
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:47,650
And let's suppose
this is the winning --

341
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:52,880
doesn't look like
a winner to me,

342
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,690
because I think it could
probably do better, but --

343
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,390
capital U star.

344
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:01,070
But remember that
we're measuring --

345
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,210
what's the K norm stuff?

346
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,150
I'm measuring the difference
between these two not

347
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:11,860
pointwise, which would
be of course pleasant

348
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,530
to say, OK, the distance
is just, you know,

349
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:21,200
maybe the maximum distance
or the mean square error.

350
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,200
That would be quite pleasant.

351
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:30,280
But here the measure of
distance involves this K,

352
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,740
which comes with the problem.

353
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:41,510
So by distance here
I mean the distance

354
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,320
between U star and u star.

355
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:51,360
Can I write it with a
capital K there to indicate

356
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,080
that that's the K norm?

357
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,500
That's the norm in which this is
small, as small as can be made.

358
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,840
And what is the K norm for
this particular problem?

359
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,450
Well it's the integral,
and involves the c,

360
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:15,680
and it involves the U star prime
minus the u star prime square

361
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:22,810
dx, integrated from 0 to 1.

362
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,440
I'm just picking
this example problem

363
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,270
so that you get some idea of
how we're measuring the error.

364
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,090
It's the natural
measure for the error.

365
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,240
It's the energy measure.

366
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,680
We're measuring error in energy.

367
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,410
This is an energy expression.

368
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,320
This thing, you know,
represents some kind

369
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,140
of elastic bar or something,
so we're measuring

370
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,910
the internal energy here.

371
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:55,390
And notice in particular,
maybe the most important point

372
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:00,180
is not the c of x, which just
comes along for the ride,

373
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:08,990
but the fact that our measure of
the error is in the derivative.

374
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,610
We're measuring error
in slopes, because those

375
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:17,370
are the stresses in
the bar, and that's

376
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:23,410
where the energy comes from,
internal strain energy.

377
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,290
OK.

378
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:32,470
So in other words, I have
this function u star,

379
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:39,020
this curved guy, and I
have this function, which

380
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,220
I'm thinking to be the winner.

381
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,440
And again, it's the
winner in the sense

382
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,670
that it minimizes this.

383
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,470
This is the minimum.

384
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:51,800
This is the expression that
we have some handle on,

385
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,100
because we know that U
star, capital U star,

386
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,080
will make that as
small as it can.

387
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,610
It does not make small
the pointwise error.

388
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,700
It might try, it
might accidentally --

389
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,620
we hope it does of course --
get pointwise error right.

390
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:17,060
But what it is constructed
to get right is energy error.

391
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,960
Make that small.

392
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,630
OK.

393
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,860
So now the question is how do
we estimate the difference?

394
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,550
OK.

395
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,750
So now, here's
this key point, how

396
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,060
do we estimate the difference.

397
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,310
Again we're looking
at the error.

398
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:39,330
By the way, I should have,
maybe I did, put a square there.

399
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,380
That was the norm
squared, but of course,

400
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,610
minimizing the norm -- you
realize why I don't want a big

401
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,990
square root sign,
it's just clumsy.

402
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,400
So I'm looking at
the square there.

403
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,115
OK.

404
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:53,740
So now, how do you
estimate that thing?

405
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:58,280
How do you estimate
the thing, knowing

406
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:05,060
that this piecewise linear, that
came out of some finite element

407
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:10,940
calculation or some giant
code, is best possible?

408
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,670
Well here's the idea.

409
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:28,980
Look at a convenient candidate
that might not be the winner.

410
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,340
Let me put, because this
was as small as possible,

411
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:43,330
this is less than or
equal to U minus u star --

412
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:54,130
always in the correct measure
-- for every trial function U.

413
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:59,380
This just says what I've
said now three ways,

414
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,900
that U star's the
best in the K norm.

415
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:10,940
Now I -- to get some bound
on this, I can take any U,

416
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,530
I can take any U and estimate
its difference from U star,

417
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,410
and that will give me a bound.

418
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:21,800
In other words, I don't know
what this particular guy

419
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
happened to be.

420
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,770
Let me just jump
to the key idea.

421
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,730
I know that that one is
better than the one --

422
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,040
and if I had a
different color --

423
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,340
maybe this thing has
got another color.

424
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Okay, here's another color.

425
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,490
I know it's better
than, for example --

426
00:28:54,490 --> 00:29:00,050
I'm just going to pick one
piecewise linear trial function

427
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,520
that's quite convenient.

428
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:08,780
Pick the one that
interpolates the exact one.

429
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,150
OK.

430
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:15,040
Now for some reason, known
only to finite elements,

431
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,970
that wasn't the
finite element winner.

432
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:22,500
That wasn't U star, that was
another U. For example --

433
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:29,620
so like, I'll put it in
blue here -- for example,

434
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:38,760
take U to be the function
that interpolates u star,

435
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,500
little u star, the function
that I've drawn here.

436
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:50,020
Since our question is how close
can we get to the curved guy

437
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:54,825
by piecewise linear,
well, one choice

438
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:58,455
is how close does
the interpolate come.

439
00:29:58,455 --> 00:30:00,160
It doesn't necessarily
come the closest.

440
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,980
Probably not.

441
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,350
But it's in the right ballpark.

442
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,590
So now I just ask
the question, and let

443
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:11,660
me draw the same picture again.

444
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,300
I have a function
and I interpolate it

445
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,990
by piecewise linear guys.

446
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:27,330
So piecewise linear
function there.

447
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:32,520
And so this is a comparison
between the u star

448
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:41,840
and its interpolate, which
is my candidate U that I'm

449
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,670
recommending as a trial.

450
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,260
And now it's a pure
approximation question.

451
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,880
You see, we no longer have to
know all about finite elements,

452
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,470
we don't have to know anything
about finite elements.

453
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:02,540
We're just asking the question:
if you give me a function,

454
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:07,750
and you compare it with the
piecewise linear interpolate,

455
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,940
how far apart are they?

456
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,980
How far apart?

457
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:21,150
And let me call the step
size h, and of course,

458
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,760
could be unequal steps.

459
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,270
It could be unstructured mesh.

460
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,860
Everything works here.

461
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:34,410
Now we come to just a basic sort
of understanding of calculus.

462
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:41,540
How close does a curve
come from the chord?

463
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,720
Really, that's what
it's come down to.

464
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,210
How close is a curved
function from a chord?

465
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,490
I can even blow that up.

466
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,050
So here I have some
curve going up,

467
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,450
and compare that with the chord.

468
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,010
And this distance here is h.

469
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:12,950
Anybody know?

470
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:17,230
So I'm just looking
for something like,

471
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,930
is the difference of order
h, is it of order h square,

472
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,830
is it of order e to the h.

473
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:27,360
What the distance
between the two?

474
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,560
And you could imagine it's a
parabola, because I'm focusing

475
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,270
down on just a little piece.

476
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,690
I take a little parabola,
a little h piece of it,

477
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,050
and I compare it
with a chord, what's

478
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,000
the distance between the two?

479
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,650
That distance there.

480
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:53,220
Well your eye probably tells
you that it's smaller than h,

481
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,750
because h was this
big, and I'm only

482
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,190
looking this big vertically.

483
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:06,250
So this distance, that distance
there, maximum distance,

484
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,240
is of order h square.

485
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,100
But that's not the question.

486
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,740
The question is how
far apart are these,

487
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,570
how far apart of the
these in this measure?

488
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,170
How far apart are the slopes?

489
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:36,620
Because the K norm is dealing
with the slopes, and not

490
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,420
the function itself.

491
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,500
So more important than the
distance is the error in slope,

492
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,770
and would you want to
guess what that's like?

493
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,860
What's your guess on that,
the error in the slope?

494
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,470
Now the slopes are not going
to be as good as the function,

495
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,700
as always.

496
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,420
Slopes are one derivative
higher, you lose something,

497
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,930
you get order h.

498
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,590
So that's the error.

499
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,830
Let's see, I hope
I'm right here.

500
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,500
Yeah.

501
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,370
I think that's right.

502
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:25,440
There I was speaking
pointwise, and then I've

503
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,610
got to integrate it
over the whole interval

504
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,670
here, a unit interval.

505
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:38,450
So if I square it, of course,
I'm going to get h square,

506
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,192
and then if I integrated
it, I still have h square,

507
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:43,150
and then when I take the
square root, I have h.

508
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,530
So h is the right quantity.

509
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:54,940
If I can put down here what our
conclusion was from this method

510
00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:03,640
by taking capital U to
be this convenient --

511
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,910
not the only choice,
but a convenient choice,

512
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,290
just to get an idea
what the error might be.

513
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,760
And then the error
from the actual U star

514
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,100
is got to be
better, our estimate

515
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:22,310
is order of h for this
particular application.

516
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,810
This particular application.

517
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:32,100
That's the error in
energy norm in the slopes.

518
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:41,380
So the theory of finite
elements would go ahead

519
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:47,540
to try to show that the error
in the distance between them,

520
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:52,320
in the displacement you
could say, is h square.

521
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,710
But that's not so easy, and I
won't be able to do it here.

522
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:02,250
Why is it not easy to say that
the error in the displacement

523
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,750
is of order h square?

524
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:09,350
It's certainly true for
this interpolate, right.

525
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:12,530
There's no question that the
interpolate you could easily

526
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:17,190
see is h square, order h
square away from the function.

527
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:25,950
But the point is that
capital U star was not

528
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:30,330
the best in staying
near the function,

529
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,600
it was only the best in
staying near the slope.

530
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:40,440
So I don't have this
crutch to lean on here.

531
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,760
This is in the K norm, and
not in the mean square norm.

532
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,960
It's in a norm that
deals with slope, but not

533
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,901
with just plain
displacement distance.

534
00:36:53,901 --> 00:36:54,400
OK.

535
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,330
Maybe that's made the point.

536
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:03,650
And this is the part of finite
element theory just to do that.

537
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,280
OK.

538
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,280
If I could take a
minute about notation,

539
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:19,650
because the notation that
I've used here of a K

540
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,130
is really a matrix notation.

541
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,660
You don't truly see it
in finite element papers.

542
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,040
For me, it's clear, right?

543
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,160
I mean that identity
was quite clear

544
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,280
from vectors and matrices.

545
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,720
But with finite elements I'm
really dealing with functions.

546
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:49,610
So it's not fair to use
matrix notation, you know,

547
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:54,150
when it's integrals, and
derivatives, and functions

548
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,090
that are involve here.

549
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:59,910
You know, these are functions,
and the actual solution

550
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,140
is a function.

551
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:13,500
So I all I want to do is mention
the notation that you now see,

552
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:20,820
say in 16.920, the engineering
course that would be, you know,

553
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:26,690
quite related to this one of
finite elements and Galerkin

554
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,840
and all sorts of stuff, that
we'll touch in the remaining

555
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,880
weeks.

556
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,900
How would they write the
minimization problem?

557
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,470
The original problem now, going
back to the original problem,

558
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,560
and just saying, wait a
minute, we didn't really

559
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,600
have a good notation for it.

560
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,400
The thing I'm looking for is
a notation -- it's like this.

561
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:05,770
This is the kind of thing that I
want, c of x u prime square dx.

562
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:10,360
Well, it might also
have a first-order term

563
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,160
a d of x, u square of
x, it could have that.

564
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,620
It could have
second derivatives.

565
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:21,380
It could be in two variables.

566
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:30,390
For Laplace we had minimum of
du/dx squared and du/dx squared

567
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:39,470
dxdy, well and we had
the linear term too.

568
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:44,040
I've just written sort
of the left-hand side,

569
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,110
the quadratic term.

570
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:51,860
And all I want to say is that
everybody, well not everybody,

571
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,570
but a lot of people now,
would use the notation

572
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:02,840
a of u, u for the
quadratic term.

573
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,540
So that a of u, u,
in an engineering

574
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:09,910
paper represents the
internal strain energy,

575
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:14,450
whether it's this, whether
it's this, a combination.

576
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:19,950
It somehow suggest
to us it's quadratic.

577
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:27,800
And there's a linear term, and
that's often written l of u.

578
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,560
So I better put down
what l of u typically is.

579
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,600
This l of u might be the
integral of f of x u of x dx.

580
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,220
That would be the linear term.

581
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:50,940
And I think I'd be happier
to have the 1/2 there.

582
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:58,780
So that -- really, it's
just a match with this,

583
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,830
but somehow it's
a little cooler.

584
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:08,530
This looks so much like
vectors and matrices,

585
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,900
that that and that
is kind of neutral.

586
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,850
OK.

587
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,295
So I'm just speaking
about notation here,

588
00:41:15,295 --> 00:41:17,430
and I could've
mentioned this last time

589
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,720
when I was speaking about all
these examples from calculus

590
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,640
of variations.

591
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,450
OK.

592
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,740
So that's the minimum problem.

593
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,890
If you give me that notation
for the minimum problem,

594
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:37,780
what's the weak form
in this notation?

595
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,490
So I'm introducing this just
because you see it elsewhere.

596
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:45,620
It's it's exactly what
we're doing all the time,

597
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,680
so I just want you
to recognize it.

598
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,450
OK.

599
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:51,120
So how do we get the weak form?

600
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,890
Can I recap how you
get the weak form?

601
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:57,650
If u is the winner.

602
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,160
Right.

603
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,720
I'll just think of
u as the winner.

604
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,050
Then if I move it by
v, move it a little,

605
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,200
then this expression
should go up.

606
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,320
So what happens
if I move it by v?

607
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,820
So I'm going to compare the two.

608
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:19,500
I'm going to compare that with
1/2 a of u plus v, you know,

609
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,010
upped a little,
minus l of u plus v.

610
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:27,660
And the point is that
this guy should be --

611
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,660
maybe I'll erase min and
put in less or equal to.

612
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:38,040
I'm just recapping
that this should

613
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:43,150
be less or equal to
this one for all v. You

614
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,580
see it's the weak stuff?

615
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,140
u is the winner.

616
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,310
I'm now using u and
not u star, and I'm

617
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:59,120
using v for the delta
u, for the movement

618
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,920
away from the winner,
which raises the energy.

619
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
OK.

620
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,480
Now what do I plan to do?

621
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:16,110
I plan to cancel common terms
here, and see what's going on,

622
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,940
and find that first variation.

623
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,340
Just what I did last time.

624
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,270
I'm just doing it in
this new notation.

625
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,900
So what's the point?

626
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,440
This l of u is linear.

627
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:36,140
So l of u plus v is the same
as l of u and l of v, right.

628
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,720
If I put in u plus
v there, it splits

629
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,310
into two integrals here they
are, so when I subtract,

630
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:45,690
these guys go.

631
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,700
Now, what about this one?

632
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,120
Well, just as last time
when I put in u plus v

633
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:56,820
here and expanded everything,
now I have something squared.

634
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:02,910
So this business here
is going to be 1/2.

635
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:07,010
I'll get something
from the u alone.

636
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:13,450
And then I'll get two something,
canceling the 1/2, from u

637
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:17,180
and v, that's the cross term.

638
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,350
And then I'll get
something from the v alone.

639
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:32,510
I'm dodging a couple of
bullets here just going

640
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,631
to the main point.

641
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:34,130
OK.

642
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,580
So the main point is
I'm going to subtract,

643
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,750
I'm going to at the differences.

644
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,610
So the zero-order
terms are all gone,

645
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:51,210
and it's this quantity that
has to be greater or equal 0,

646
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,380
right -- because I was left with
that greater or equal sign --

647
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,130
for all v. OK.

648
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:10,740
Don't let me leave
minus l of v there.

649
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:16,790
OK.

650
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:19,450
So that's the thing that has
to be greater or equal to 0.

651
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:25,810
Now we're just going to repeat
the same the discussion that we

652
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:29,170
had last time with
different letters.

653
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:34,680
If this is going to be
greater or equal 0 for all v,

654
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,520
then I'm going to think of
small v's, in which case

655
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,820
this term is going to be smaller
than the others and won't help.

656
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,140
So what has to happen?

657
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,820
What has to happen for this
to be greater equal to 0

658
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,020
for all v?

659
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,970
You know like we're
taking the derivative

660
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:56,980
in the direction of v. We're
moving in the direction of v.

661
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,720
And this is the
first-order term,

662
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,710
that's the first variation.

663
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:06,220
That's what has to
be 0 for all of v.

664
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:13,270
I guess I can bring it over
here if you eye will follow it.

665
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:24,100
I have a of u, v
minus l of v, that's

666
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,870
the sort of first-order term,
and then the second-order term.

667
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:33,120
Has to be greater
or equal 0, all v.

668
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,450
And the question is so what?

669
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:37,840
What do we get out of that?

670
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,830
Well what I'm
saying is this stuff

671
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:47,000
has to be 0, because v
could have either sign.

672
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,390
So if this was
positive or negative,

673
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,180
I could switch
sign if I want to.

674
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,270
So it has to be 0.

675
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:06,380
So a of u, v has to equal l of
v, and that's the weak form.

676
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:11,560
That's the weak form, that's
the form integral of c u prime v

677
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:17,780
prime dx equals
integral of f*v*dx.

678
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:24,530
That's the l of v, and
this is the a of u and v.

679
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:29,190
This is what you see
in engineering papers,

680
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,540
when they're launching into
the finite element method,

681
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:38,860
and they're planning
to get some notation.

682
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,540
That's a very familiar notation.

683
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:49,290
And then the final point
is what about this term?

684
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:53,130
So now we know this is 0.

685
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:59,090
This is the weak form
of the equation, find u,

686
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:02,210
so that this holds
for all v. That's

687
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:03,590
the weak form of the equation.

688
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,980
Oh yeah, I better
not rush by it.

689
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,430
This is the form in
which you plug in --

690
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:15,310
this is the form finite
elements come from.

691
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:24,530
It doesn't solve this
equation exactly.

692
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:27,210
This is the
differential equation.

693
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:27,970
I'm in here.

694
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,390
It's our Euler-Lagrange
equation.

695
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:40,390
The finite element method says,
OK, take the trial functions,

696
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:44,290
and get it right for those guys.

697
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:49,830
So that give us our
N equations, where

698
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,640
this is a continuous problem.

699
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,540
Yeah.

700
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:57,570
So this is what
just leads you --

701
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:01,200
the weak form is what leads you
naturally to finite elements.

702
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,490
You take this, and
you only make it

703
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,800
true on a finite
dimensional space.

704
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,300
OK.

705
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:12,680
And the final comment
is what about this guy?

706
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:17,110
Well the whole point is that
we assume positive definite,

707
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,820
we assume stability,
we've made our life easy

708
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:25,970
by guaranteeing by the fact that
this is always greater equal 0.

709
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,690
I don't even have to
think about this one.

710
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,100
OK.

711
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,800
Because if u and v
are the same, this

712
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,540
is a square, and that
material coefficient that

713
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,620
better be not negative, right.

714
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,370
OK.

715
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:44,350
Thank you for your
patience to listen to that.

716
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,810
See this notation
for the same thing

717
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:50,720
that we did last time
for the weak form,

718
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,190
and you see how it pays
off immediately to give us

719
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,350
the finite element form.

720
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,240
OK.

721
00:49:59,240 --> 00:49:59,840
Good.

722
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,200
So the project
ones are all there,

723
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,660
and there's just two
or three left here.

724
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,590
And I hope you have
a super weekend,

725
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:13,300
and do give a thought
to project two.
