00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,520
PROFESSOR STRANG:
So I'm hoping you

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,560
will ask some questions today.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,940
So we've had the exam.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,320
If you have any questions
about grading the two TAs

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,320
are the people to speak to.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,540
Ramis graded Questions
one and two, and Peter

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,820
graded three and four.

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,980
And they control things.

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,570
I mean, I can help if
there's an emergency,

17
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,370
but they would be the
right people to speak to.

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,440
Because they know how they
graded the whole test.

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,970
Before you ask questions, can
I just say why this truss --

20
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,450
you remember this
six-sided truss --

21
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:09,070
tied me in a knot and I'm hoping
your MATLAB solution will untie

22
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,010
that knot.

23
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,380
The knot I was in was to
find the mechanisms, to find

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,490
convenient mechanisms
because we have,

25
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,960
well, I thought we had six bars.

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,510
It looks like we have six bars.

27
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,640
But somebody pointed
out after class

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,350
that that bar six
is not very active.

29
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,940
It's connecting two
supports, can't do anything,

30
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,550
and actually that sixth
row of the A matrix

31
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,570
will be all zeroes.

32
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,540
So our matrix, if we include
that, there was no use,

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,250
it doesn't help.

34
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,230
So our matrix then really
comes from the five bars,

35
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:03,030
so A is then five by, two
unknowns, two, two, two,

36
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,370
making altogether
eight unknowns.

37
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:12,120
So three mechanisms and
that's what I'm hoping for.

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,480
So when I unwisely drew
that picture on the board

39
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,200
at the end of the truss
lecture, I was only

40
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,100
looking for two
mechanisms because I

41
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,140
was thinking we had
six edges, six bars,

42
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,260
but really this bar,
when I knock out

43
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,000
the columns that correspond
to that node and that node,

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,230
there will only be
zeroes left in that row.

45
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,310
And it's nothing.

46
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,880
It correctly tells us that the
stretching of that bar is zero

47
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,990
but we knew that anyway.

48
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:57,510
OK, I don't know if you've
tackled the MATLAB question,

49
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,620
and I also don't know whether
MATLAB would produce for us--

50
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,240
I mean, you should
be able to construct

51
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,650
A with a whole lot of
square roots of three

52
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:16,290
over two from sine of 60
degrees and maybe 1/2's

53
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,890
from sine of 30 degrees.

54
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,250
A should look pretty nice, but
what the solutions to these

55
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,000
mechanisms are, of
course solutions to Au=0,

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,350
and-- Anyway, I'm hoping that
we learn from this example.

57
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,490
I hadn't intended-- So
it's pretty small MATLAB,

58
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,900
it's really just the
creation of the matrix A.

59
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,500
OK, so that was a
comment on that,

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,190
which I added to the homework.

61
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:57,340
Now, I'm ready for questions
about the homework, the exam

62
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,070
whatever, yes thank you.

63
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,430
Oh, good.

64
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

65
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,596
PROFESSOR STRANG:
For trusses, OK.

66
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:10,470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

67
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,250
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

68
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,600
A^T A immediately, couldn't you?

69
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,780
It's not quite so
straightforward.

70
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,650
And this is like more realistic.

71
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,080
I mean, yeah.

72
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Ah.

73
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,630
I guess, yeah, but remind
me what that question was.

74
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:37,170
This was a 2.7 problem one?

75
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,050
OK, let me just see
what I'm asking for.

76
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,020
So, OK, yes.

77
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,540
So I only asked
about A transpose A,

78
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,750
I only asked you for the
shape in that question.

79
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,820
Oh, and then I asked you for
the first row, good for me, yes.

80
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,985
I see, the first row
so I didn't put you

81
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:03,210
to the agony of writing
out the whole thing,

82
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:09,550
but still how do you get the
first row, good question.

83
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,334
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

84
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,500
PROFESSOR STRANG: Oh, I see.

85
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,790
Now, well it's not
going to be so neat.

86
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,320
Let's just think.

87
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,090
We could do the first row of
A, and the first column of A

88
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,750
probably, yeah.

89
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,800
So what am I looking
for in A transpose A,

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,140
because it didn't say row one.

91
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:41,710
OK, so row one of A transpose A
corresponds to the first-- Oh,

92
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,800
so what is row one?

93
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,380
Yeah, this is worth
thinking about.

94
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,850
So this is A transpose
A for trusses.

95
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,830
And let's just,
maybe we could even

96
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,830
take this one as an example.

97
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:01,330
If I number the nodes, if that's
my first node, A transpose A,

98
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,460
you remember that's square.

99
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,960
That tells us the edge part,
the bar part is built into it.

100
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,540
But its size is n by n, its
size is five by, no, its size

101
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,740
is what, eight by eight, right?

102
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,670
It's got to do with
the number of-- OK.

103
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:29,830
So its first row, what will
its first row be about?

104
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:36,920
It'll be about u H 1, right?

105
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,050
The first row of
this A transpose

106
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:46,260
A matrix will be about, the
first node but more than that,

107
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,690
that node has got two
things, u H and u V,

108
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,160
and we're putting H first.

109
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:59,140
So so I think that the first
row of this, let's just draw it.

110
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,660
Maybe I'm not saying--

111
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,860
So let that be A
transpose A, I see, yeah.

112
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:12,820
A transpose A will be
multiplying u H 1, u V 1,

113
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,991
and so forth.

114
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:14,490
Right?

115
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,950
OK, good.

116
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,800
So now this is better.

117
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,260
All I'm asking is
where do we know

118
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,040
there are zeroes in that
first row of A transpose A?

119
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,480
Where would we know that there
are zeroes for this problem

120
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,210
rather than-- I won't
redraw the one in the book

121
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,260
so I'm taking this truss.

122
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,600
So if it's this truss,
this is the first node,

123
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,130
the bars are numbered like
this, and of course your MATLAB

124
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,630
construction of A, you might
multiply out A transpose A.

125
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,700
Because in MATLAB that
would be so quick.

126
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,780
And you could see
what it looks like.

127
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,980
And where would we expect
to see zeroes or not zeroes?

128
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:04,580
Let's see, A transpose
A, so I'll have to think.

129
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,780
My instinct is that it should
only connect two neighbors.

130
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,750
So that I would
imagine, but I've

131
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,490
got-- These are
double neighbors,

132
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,670
right, there's two
people living here.

133
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,290
We have to remember.

134
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,370
So I see two people living
here and two people at home,

135
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,920
so I guess I would imagine four
non-zeroes for this problem

136
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,770
in in the first row.

137
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:37,820
I would think that that would
have somebody on the diagonal.

138
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,450
That would be what
multiplies u H 1 itself,

139
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,970
and then maybe u V 1 is
involved, and these two guys.

140
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,750
These two and those two
would not be involved.

141
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,100
Well, that's only
a partial answer,

142
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,970
I'm just telling you where
the zeroes are, I think.

143
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:01,110
And you're really asking about
the non-zeroes, of course.

144
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,680
So, yeah.

145
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,990
Not so easy.

146
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,490
Yeah --

147
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:07,750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

148
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,458
PROFESSOR STRANG: --
maybe have to do it.

149
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:13,340
OK, yeah.

150
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:18,140
I think, the first time
better to do it, yeah.

151
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,900
But that's an
excellent question,

152
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,250
and maybe we will find a
nice, and if somebody does,

153
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,190
let me know.

154
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,210
A nice way to see that.

155
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,450
Somehow I must have
felt that was doable

156
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:37,590
when I created that problem.

157
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,120
OK.

158
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,520
The other thing to say
though, that while I'm

159
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,090
looking at A transpose
A, is remember

160
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:53,710
that it can be created by
these element matrices.

161
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,530
Yeah, yeah, that's
important to say.

162
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:02,230
So there will be five
element matrices, right?

163
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,460
Because I've got five bars.

164
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,810
And the element matrix
for this bar, or say

165
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,310
for a typical bar, the
element matrix for this bar

166
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,230
will involve all the u's that
are connected to this bar.

167
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,550
So two u's there
and two u's there,

168
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,130
so it'll be four by four,
the element matrix here.

169
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:30,230
So this will contribute four
non-zeroes to that to row

170
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,470
and to three other rows.

171
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,750
That four by four guy
from this part is,

172
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,640
you know what I'm
speaking about here?

173
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,370
The element matrix which is
just-- The element matrix

174
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:47,950
is a cosine, sine, minus
cosine and minus sine.

175
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,780
Column times row.

176
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,440
Cosine, sine, minus
cosine, minus sine.

177
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,450
This is the element
matrix for this bar,

178
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,750
those are the cosine
and sine of 60 degrees,

179
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:10,450
and those positions would
be these two and these two.

180
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,640
So there would be actually four
zeroes coming after, and after

181
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,360
here from those
two and those two.

182
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,570
So this bar contributes
to A transpose A,

183
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,620
sort of stamps
into A transpose A.

184
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:33,190
This four by four of non-zeroes
plus the rest zeroes, stamps

185
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,690
that in up there.

186
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:43,530
This guy has its
own element matrix.

187
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,470
Now, what's different about the
element matrix for this guy?

188
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,300
Of course it's got its own c_1,
probably, and it had a c_2,

189
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,480
this difference constant.

190
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,250
But bigger
differences than that.

191
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,000
First of all, it's a
different angle, theta.

192
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,540
Here the angle is 120
degrees, and also there's

193
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,000
nobody home down there.

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,440
So it would be, if we
were dealing with A_0,

195
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,220
free-free stuff, it
would be four by four,

196
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,550
like all the others.

197
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:23,080
But because these two are
fixed, those two displacements

198
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,530
are fixed, effectively it will
only contribute two by two.

199
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,250
A total of four non-zeroes.

200
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,090
But those will stamp
into A transpose

201
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,270
A overlapping this guy.

202
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,030
Then the ones from
these bars will not

203
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,160
touch the first row
of A transpose A,

204
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,730
so they wouldn't
touch the answer

205
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,810
to that homework problem.

206
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,510
So you see again another way.

207
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,210
By hand, I don't know
that you necessarily

208
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,610
want to use these element
matrices, I'm not sure.

209
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,720
But it gives an excellent check.

210
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,320
So one way to
create A transpose A

211
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,520
is create a-- Multiply,
that's one way.

212
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,450
Second way is, create A
transpose A element by--

213
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:23,310
By these five element matrices
popped into the right places.

214
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,670
I think this is, so this like
the computational science

215
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:31,430
part of the course.

216
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,580
It's the way you
would, I'm really

217
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,310
speaking about the way you
would write the code, not

218
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,090
the final result. So,
much of the course

219
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:44,200
has been devoted to
understanding A transpose A,

220
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,900
and the fact that it's
positive definite,

221
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,990
or in this case only positive
semi-definite because we

222
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,560
have an eight by eight
matrix whose rank is only

223
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,440
going to be five.

224
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,960
So this matrix will have
these same mechanisms,

225
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,420
and I'm hoping to
learn what they are.

226
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,700
Well I hope that's a little
help with that question.

227
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,600
But basically,
though, it's non-help

228
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,200
because I'm sort of
saying you're on your own

229
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,000
to actually-- I don't have
a superfragilistic way

230
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,550
to construct a matrix and then
you kind of have to do it.

231
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,860
But I'm glad you asked.

232
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,850
Yes?

233
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

234
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,770
PROFESSOR STRANG: More
on this problem, OK.

235
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,795
The sign convention.

236
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

237
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,586
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes.

238
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:43,270
So let's see.

239
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,310
So I made a speech about
sign conventions, right?

240
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,050


241
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:54,290
Which was that I am
too old for them.

242
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,310
And the justification
for that is the fact

243
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,010
that they wash out
in A transpose.

244
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,630
So if you were to use the
wrong sign convention in A,

245
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,360
you won't see it
in A transpose A.

246
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,140
So if I change the whole thing.

247
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:15,420
So sign convention is
not really a convention.

248
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:22,590
Our convention is to decide that
that movement that way is plus.

249
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,290
And movement this way is plus.

250
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,550
And here, similarly.

251
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,220
That's a plus movement and
that's a plus movement.

252
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,620
That's our sign convention.

253
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,250
If we always do that,
then the A matrix

254
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,390
is telling us how much
this bar stretches.

255
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,480
It's the matrix that gives
us stretching from these four

256
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,840
displacements.

257
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:54,500
And then, these, I
think in this picture,

258
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,510
if this is the later node
and this is the thing,

259
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,860
then that angle
from the horizontal

260
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,540
is the right guy to put there.

261
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,902
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

262
00:16:05,902 --> 00:16:06,860
PROFESSOR STRANG: Here?

263
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

264
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:18,130
PROFESSOR STRANG: Well,
I guess I'm, I see,

265
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,360
the question is what's
the sign convention

266
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,200
with this particular picture?

267
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,280
Yeah, if this is node
one and that's two,

268
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,340
then-- Your question is good.

269
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,970
It looks, I think, so I
think I've got it not right.

270
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,890
If this is node one down
below, and two up above,

271
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:46,690
then moving two positively
would stretch the bar.

272
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,580
And I've got minuses there.

273
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:53,200
So I've got the opposite signs.

274
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,450
I've got there, the signs that
would go with this numbering.

275
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,120
If that was node two
and this was node one.

276
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,440
Yeah, you're right, good.

277
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
You have to, and that's
the only way I do it,

278
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,260
is to think will the
movement stretch the bar?

279
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,620
Then that's got a
positive entry in A. Will

280
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,040
the movement like that
compress the bar, that'll

281
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,410
be a negative entry.

282
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:25,900
And our conventions are if
it stretches that's positive.

283
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:32,180
e positive means a stretching;
e negative means a compression.

284
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,480
So it takes a little patience.

285
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,590
Or it takes writing
the code correctly once

286
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:46,140
and then of course it would
do it for all these problems.

287
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,910
Yeah, I think the TA
in an earlier year

288
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,960
actually wrote a code
to, a truss code.

289
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,010
I don't know what happened
to it but I could look.

290
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

291
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:08,330
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes, yeah.

292
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,060
That's right, and it
will come out consistent.

293
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:16,500
Yeah, if I take horizontal-- if
I take the same convention that

294
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,920
forces that way are plus,
that's a plus f H 1,

295
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:29,410
and it's a plus u H 1, then I'll
get A will go to A transpose.

296
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,020
Yeah, so if I'm consistent
that plus for the u's,

297
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,160
for the displacements, and
plus for the f's, forces,

298
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,510
then the correctly created
A will give me the correct A

299
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,680
transpose.

300
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,150
But A transpose
A has the ability

301
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:51,640
to bury some of
those conventions.

302
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,641
OK.

303
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:53,140
Good.

304
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,690
Yes.

305
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

306
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,540
PROFESSOR STRANG: Different.

307
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,480
More.

308
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,230
Oh my God.

309
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,920
OK.

310
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,420
Yes.

311
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:08,536
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

312
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:09,910
PROFESSOR STRANG:
This one, yeah.

313
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,492
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

314
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:14,450
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

315
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:22,150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

316
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:27,360
PROFESSOR STRANG: I wish it
would ask about bar three.

317
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,490
Yeah, yeah bar three was good.

318
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,240
Yeah right.

319
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,110
Yeah, I guess here, what's here,
well, the angle is, that must

320
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:40,300
be theta, and then
this'll be right provided

321
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,740
this number is the, is what?

322
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,110
Well, I've got to
think it out again.

323
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:56,510
I'll just think it out.

324
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,120
Maybe, yeah I won't
try to, yeah I won't.

325
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,720
I won't.

326
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,730
So I think you--
But it's really,

327
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:14,160
you learn the point by
thinking that through.

328
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,760
I think we've got it here.

329
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,810
That if that's number one
then we like plus signs here

330
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:27,320
because positive displacements
will stretch the bar, right.

331
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,220
And here this sign will
depend on the angle.

332
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:38,414
And it will depend on the
number, which numbers,

333
00:20:38,414 --> 00:20:40,580
what number that one is and
what number that one is.

334
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,440
If I reverse the numbers,
then I reverse the sign.

335
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,550
Yeah, good.

336
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:52,530
Well, that's sort of part
of computational engineering

337
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,090
isn't it?

338
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,500
Like, keep track of the details.

339
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,460
But of course this
18.085 course is also

340
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,280
about big picture things.

341
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:09,660
And that's what I'm hoping
comes through even better.

342
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,270
OK, ready for another
question on any topic.

343
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:17,265
Thank you.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

345
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:28,130
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes.

346
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,980
Well, no, but let's just try it.

347
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,610
Shall we do Problem one?

348
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,540
Was it Problem one?

349
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,100
In 2.7?

350
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,470
OK, let me just draw that truss.

351
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,890
And let's just talk about it.

352
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,780
So, boy I've put a
lot of bars in there.

353
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,270
OK, so this is just one
bar down to this guy.

354
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,830
And this is one up to here.

355
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,420
And was that everything?

356
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,510
OK, and then I've numbered them.

357
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,190
Let me just copy
the number here,

358
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,520
so that we can talk about that.

359
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,470
And I numbered the
nodes one, two.

360
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,950
One.

361
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,350
Joints, I should say really.

362
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:12,930
Four.

363
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,200
OK, all right.

364
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,350
Let's just start
as I always do by,

365
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,710
what's the shape
of the matrix A?

366
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:26,600
A is what, how many
bars have I got?

367
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,430
So help me through this now.

368
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:34,390
Six bars, and how many unknown
displacements have I got?

369
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,290
Eight, OK, good.

370
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,980
And have I got any
rigid motions here?

371
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,510
No.

372
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:47,150
I've got two, these are going to
prevent all the rigid motions.

373
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:59,010
So if this matrix, if A has
rank six, which we'd probably

374
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:08,880
guess it has, you know
that there's an if there.

375
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,950
Then two mechanisms, right?

376
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,330
Eight minus six
gives two mechanisms.

377
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,100
OK, and your question
is how to find them.

378
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,930
You've got one.

379
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,290
Alright, which one have you got?

380
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,832
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

381
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:26,040
PROFESSOR STRANG: These guys.

382
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:33,320
So tilt, so that's a mechanism
that only involves u H 1 and u

383
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,300
H 2 and none of the other u's.

384
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,250
OK, that looks good.

385
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,500
So that's certainly one.

386
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,190
Now we're looking
for a second one.

387
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,900
What if, anybody suggest one?

388
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,420
Let me just give
everybody a thought.

389
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,760
If you haven't already
started on this homework,

390
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,570
you're starting now.

391
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:59,010
So I'm looking for
another mechanism,

392
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,780
and of course you
might say well,

393
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,910
suppose these bars go this way.

394
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,920
Suppose they go to
the left, and you

395
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,350
know that that's not
going to do it right.

396
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,200
And why not?

397
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,940
Why isn't that an
OK second answer?

398
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,580
Because it's effectively the
same as the first; in fact

399
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,710
the mechanism u, how would
the u, the one I've drawn

400
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:33,300
and the u for this
way, what would we see?

401
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,980
Opposite signs.

402
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,864
If this describes a u 1
H and a u 2 H positive,

403
00:24:38,864 --> 00:24:40,280
the other way
they're negative, it

404
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,590
would just be the opposite
sign, nothing new.

405
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,620
OK, so now you've had
a look, so tell me.

406
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:54,250
If somebody sees-- To
answer your question here,

407
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,880
how do you see them?

408
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,700
I don't know.

409
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,100
Just look harder.

410
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,190
Like you know, speaking French.

411
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:12,770
Just say it louder
and maybe it'll work.

412
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,970
Of course we do
have the possibility

413
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,670
to create the matrix
and look for solutions.

414
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:21,860
But it's more fun
to do it this way.

415
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,930
And now who's going to
suggest another mechanism,

416
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,650
another view?

417
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

418
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:36,590
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Three and four.

419
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,560
Wait a minute, what
was that three?

420
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,340
Oh, these nodes, OK.

421
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,520
These nodes, three
and four do what?

422
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,220
Oh yes, sorry.

423
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,400
Three go up this way.

424
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,360
Ah, I see.

425
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,580
You're rotating.

426
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:02,710
So this guy goes sort
of along this way,

427
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,470
you're taking that top
square and turning it.

428
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,720
OK, so these guys
will also turn, right?

429
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,410
Yeah, one and two will
move on your mechanism.

430
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,510
So the idea is take
that top thing,

431
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:24,300
and I'm allowed to turn it,
I'd say I have to turn it,

432
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,990
I have to keep this bar,
yeah I cannot stretch it.

433
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,940
I can't stretch any bars.

434
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,840
So when I do this turn, I can't
just keep it in place and turn.

435
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,660
No.

436
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,550
But I'm going to turn
it so that this one goes

437
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:47,280
this way and this one
goes this way, and now.

438
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,130
Alright you're, you're
responsible for telling me

439
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,390
about the other two now.

440
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,766
What do they do?

441
00:26:54,766 --> 00:26:55,640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

442
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,056
PROFESSOR STRANG: Bar four,
Will bar four keep its length?

443
00:26:58,056 --> 00:27:01,740
Ha.

444
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,970
OK, well we're not
allowed to use fancy words

445
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,430
like four-bar linkage.

446
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,550
Because somebody might
say what does that mean.

447
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,900
OK, does it, do you see that?

448
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,980
I think it does.

449
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,600
But it's wonderful.

450
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,580
If that's the original bar
and I bring this up a little,

451
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,270
a little, remember,
and this down a little,

452
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:30,020
I think that the new
bar has the same length.

453
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,080
You believe that?

454
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,560
No.

455
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,170
Some, yeah, but
what happened there?

456
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:41,222
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

457
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:43,180
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah,
this is a good example.

458
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

459
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,500
PROFESSOR STRANG: Sorry,
yeah, certainly bringing

460
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,990
that up tended to
make the bar shorter,

461
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,250
but then moving this down tended
to make it a little longer.

462
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,322
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

463
00:27:57,322 --> 00:27:58,280
PROFESSOR STRANG: Right

464
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

465
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,680
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Yeah, I think so.

466
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,180
See, that was the key.

467
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,560
We went at 90 degrees to five.

468
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,940
And by going at 90 degrees,
then the stretch in there

469
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:21,250
was only that one minus
cosine that was higher order.

470
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,580
That's the key.

471
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,290
Similarly, here,
all these-- So we're

472
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,420
avoiding stretching
by this trick.

473
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,630
So maybe this guy is
going down this same way.

474
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,390
And this guy is going
up that same way.

475
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:39,830
Yeah, because then that
bar is just translating,

476
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,580
and this bar is
translating and these two

477
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:49,530
are doing the same thing, which
I believe is not stretching.

478
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,080
Is this the answer that
maybe somebody already got?

479
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,000
And believed in?

480
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,960
Yeah.

481
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,910
So to answer your original
question, it wasn't obvious,

482
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,250
was it?

483
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,800
But I think that
is the right thing.

484
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,270
And actually, you could
create the A for this problem.

485
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,980
Well, it's a bit
large, 48 entries,

486
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:19,600
but because four of the bars
are horizontal or vertical,

487
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,670
you will have many, many,
many, zeroes in the A matrix.

488
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,210
It would be sort
of fun to create

489
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,000
the A matrix and then this.

490
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,970
So what is this displacement
that I believe in?

491
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,860
This u mechanism that
we've talked about.

492
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,770
Let's see, if I look at one
that was positive positive.

493
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:46,580
If I looked at node two, that
was positive over but down.

494
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,340
So horizontal but down.

495
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,470
If I look at node three,
that's positive positive.

496
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,660
Yeah, one and three
is hanging on.

497
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,840
And number four is like
number two, one and minus one.

498
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,590
I think that's the u
which should solve Au=0.

499
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:09,020


500
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,030
Yeah.

501
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,580
OK.

502
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:16,560
But that's a good example.

503
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,600
OK, so that's trusses.

504
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,475
What else?

505
00:30:21,475 --> 00:30:22,350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

506
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,516
PROFESSOR STRANG: Thank you.

507
00:30:23,516 --> 00:30:25,720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

508
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,790
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Oh, well, let's see.

509
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:33,400
That's a good question
and now I guess we're, ah.

510
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,200
Yeah well, the way I've
drawn it at 45 degrees, which

511
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,500
is what I wrote here,
then I did build in,

512
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,890
I did make that a forty--
I did make this 45 or 135

513
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,460
or something.

514
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,790
And 45.

515
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,840
To get that, if that
goes at 45 degrees,

516
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,170
then this had better
go at 135, right?

517
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,880
So that has to be a right angle.

518
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,160
If the support
was over here then

519
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,700
the angle that would have
gone off with was changed.

520
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,020
Yeah, so very good point,
that the numbers I've

521
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,970
written down on the picture
I drew required these angles

522
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:25,040
to be those nice numbers.

523
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,040
I hope you like these
trusses a little.

524
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:40,430
I mean, you get some freedom
to visualize a little.

525
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,250
Good, yes.

526
00:31:41,250 --> 00:32:01,951
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

527
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:02,950
PROFESSOR STRANG: Maybe.

528
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,560
Let me see.

529
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,410
I thought you were
going to say, could I

530
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:14,070
have two and three go inwards
and one and four go outwards?

531
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,810
You don't like that.

532
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:21,590
I would go with that.

533
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,540
Is that any good?

534
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,000
Well, OK.

535
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,360
Yeah, linear
algebra spoke there.

536
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,825
It's a combination of
the other two, yes.

537
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:30,200
If we only got a
two-dimensional.

538
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,800


539
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,696

540
00:32:33,696 --> 00:32:34,820

542
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:36,980
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

544
00:32:38,092 --> 00:32:39,050
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

546
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:43,510
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

548
00:32:45,872 --> 00:32:46,830
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

549
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:51,270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

550
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,130
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK.

551
00:32:54,130 --> 00:33:00,190
But let me-- When you
suggested one, I overwrote it.

552
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:07,130
Now, the one you suggested--
When you told me,

553
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:10,890
OK, bring these in, I thought,
OK, these have to go out.

554
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:19,347
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

555
00:33:19,347 --> 00:33:21,680
PROFESSOR STRANG: They're not
allowed to change lengths,

556
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,550
so they can only swing
around these pin joints.

557
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:33,130
So the picture of the one that
I drew after your question

558
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:37,970
would be, these guys, this
guy, let me draw the square,

559
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,120
as it was.

560
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,670
And then these guys
came in a little.

561
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,400
These guys went out a little.

562
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,620
And we got this.

563
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:51,757
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

564
00:33:51,757 --> 00:33:53,090
PROFESSOR STRANG: No, that's OK.

565
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,430
I think this is legitimate,
this is a legitimate one.

566
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:04,090
And that bar, every bar now is
doing the same kind of thing

567
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:04,950
that this one did.

568
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,770
This moved a little,
but this compensated

569
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,680
and kept the length the same.

570
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:18,640
Your question has led us
to another nifty mechanism.

571
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,880
It's good, a good
one to think about.

572
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:33,642
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

573
00:34:33,642 --> 00:34:34,600
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

574
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,880
It's movement
without stretching.

575
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,370
Movement without
stretching is the key, yes.

576
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,530
And then where
does collapse come?

577
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,880
So I use the word
collapse pretty freely.

578
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,240
So the word collapse
comes in because since it

579
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,650
can move without stretching
there's nothing controlling it,

580
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:59,160
it can move-- Well,
if we stayed linear,

581
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,640
then I could make all
those ten and the thing

582
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,110
would be even worse, of course.

583
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:10,900
The truth is that if I
made those even one or ten

584
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,440
I would be out of
the linear range.

585
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,760
These all should be
0.01's or something.

586
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,440
But linear we don't
know the difference.

587
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,040
OK, I'm glad you've
got that suggestion.

588
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,580
And now somebody correctly
says that this one

589
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,730
must be some combination
of that and what

590
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,060
was the first movement?

591
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,890
Oh, the upper two.

592
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,320
Which it must be.

593
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,850
Amazing, how many-- Put a few
bars up there and you got it.

594
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,510
Yeah.

595
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,750
And of course, by
the way, and don't

596
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,320
let me get too far
into this discussion,

597
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,460
but who is the artist,
actually is it Alexander Calder

598
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,800
who has, what are they called?

599
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,960
You know, they're-- What
was it called again?

600
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
PROFESSOR STRANG:

601
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,290
Well, he has those, that wasn't
the word I was thinking of.

602
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,490
But he's created these
trusses, like with lots

603
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,720
of bars and lots of nodes that
have some special property.

604
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,260
You know, they just, anyway.

605
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:26,770
It touches on art, actually
this theory of mechanisms.

606
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,370
Yeah it's really
quite interesting.

607
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,880
But then linear algebra
somehow tells you

608
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,790
just from these numbers how many
mechanisms you're looking for.

609
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:40,890
Which is pretty cool.

610
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:45,170
OK, open for more questions.

611
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,530
You probably haven't
looked ahead,

612
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,970
I mean today's
lecture was a-- I hope

613
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:59,530
and I left up there the
central topics for the lecture.

614
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,730
But I'm, I think,
correct that you haven't

615
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,330
started on those problems.

616
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,390
To know what to ask.

617
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,930
Let me ask you a question,
which was not in the lecture.

618
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,500
Suppose I wanted to
use finite differences.

619
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,420
It's a little bit like
the one on the quiz.

620
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,860
So on the quiz we had c,
equal ones, and then c=2.

621
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,260
And you knew c had
to be four by four,

622
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:31,710
so most people correctly got the
diagonal as one, one, two, two.

623
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,140
Just by sort of common sense.

624
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,000
But what would be
a finite difference

625
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,940
approximation to our equation?

626
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,550
So suppose I didn't
go to finite elements,

627
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,590
but instead I stayed with
finite differences, which

628
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:52,200
would be completely fine in
1-D, completely sensible.

629
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,180
How would you create a finite
difference thing for that?

630
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,500
Let me just bring down
a blank board and ask.

631
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,560
So you see the equation?

632
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,310
Let me write it again here.

633
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:08,700
So I want to replace this
equation with a varying-- that

634
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,710
has varying c(x).

635
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,550


636
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,400
Well, I won't worry
about the right side.

637
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,510
It's f.

638
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:24,690
What's my K matrix using
finite differences for this?

639
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,150
We're going to create
a finite element K

640
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:32,020
matrix by the weak
form, Galerkin trial

641
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,240
function, that route.

642
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,580
That's coming-- That's very
important, that's coming,

643
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,950
started today and it'll
be completed Friday.

644
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:48,150
But now suppose we were back
up to finite differences.

645
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:54,590
What would you take for
finite differences there?

646
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:58,530
When the c wasn't
there, what did we do?

647
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,780
Then we just had second
difference, right?

648
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,450
How did we get the
second difference?

649
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:06,650
It was a first difference
of a first difference.

650
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:12,950
I guess I would probably-- This
I would probably approximate

651
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:21,550
by (u_(i+1)-u_i) over delta x.

652
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:29,080
That would be that, and so
what should I put for c(x)?

653
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,190
What would you suggest?

654
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,550


655
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:41,330
c subscript i, so let's mark.

656
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,920
Here's i, and here's
i+1, and here's i-1.

657
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,640


658
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,770
We're going to end up with
those three guys involved.

659
00:39:51,770 --> 00:40:00,780
So this takes this difference,
and then this one will take

660
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:07,300
that one, and then I'll also
have a u_i-u_(i-1) over delta

661
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,570
x.

662
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,120
And somehow that'll
be the difference

663
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,440
of these differences.

664
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,410
But now tell me
again, what would

665
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:18,940
be the really cool choice of c?

666
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:24,220
What's your instinct where
what value of c to take?

667
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,280
As sort of average.

668
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,160
I mean you could
take it just halfway.

669
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,940
I think I would take
c_(i+1/2) there.

670
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,780
Just as being sort of right.

671
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:44,670
And here I would take c_(i-1/2),
halfway along its interval.

672
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:50,340
And then the second difference
takes the difference of it.

673
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:55,940
So now I've got-- I think
that's what I would do.

674
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,750
That would be my typical,
one typical finite difference

675
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,760
equation.

676
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,430
Would be the
difference times its c

677
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,840
and I took its c
to be symmetric.

678
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,980
You could also have
taken, if you'd liked,

679
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,320
if you wanted to
stay at these points,

680
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,530
you could do twice as much
work and take, let me say,

681
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:24,270
or-- So either c_(i+1/2),
or you could average the c_i

682
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,370
and the c_(i+1) over two.

683
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:32,190
And both of those would
give you that extra accuracy

684
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,360
that you pick up from
sort of keeping symmetry

685
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,530
where you should.

686
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:42,200
So I think, I mean, this would
be the quicker one to put,

687
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,050
that one would be OK too.

688

00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,660
PROFESSOR STRANG: This was just
for your entertainment not,

690
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,155
not-- Yes, go ahead.

691
00:41:55,155 --> 00:41:56,030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

692
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,863
PROFESSOR STRANG: Ah,
when c was a step yes.

693
00:41:57,863 --> 00:41:58,750
When c was a step.

694
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:05,350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

695
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:14,960
PROFESSOR STRANG: c_(i+1/2)
Probably the step-- Yeah, yeah.

696
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,080
Yeah.

697
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:21,600
Let me ask you, what happens
in this equation when c jumps?

698
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,780
It jumped on the quiz.

699
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,980
But I didn't require you
to solve the differential

700
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,580
equation, only to create
the finite difference model,

701
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,410
to create the A transpose C A,
and most people did it fine.

702
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:40,570
But suppose c jumps.

703
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:44,170
I have some simple
right-hand side like one.

704
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,040
It's not a jump in
the right-hand side

705
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,230
I'm interested in.

706
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,890
It's a jump in c
from one to two.

707
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:53,610
So this is a topic that
the book does discuss

708
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:57,410
and maybe I might come back
to it in the ordinary lecture.

709
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:03,120
But, while it's in
front of us now,

710
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:09,960
the quiz was sort of intended
to help you with that.

711
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,800
How do I interpret this
equation when c has a jump?

712
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,990
Well, it's actually,
if you look at it

713
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:20,600
right there's no difficulty.

714
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,450
That equation is a combination
of this equation -dw/dx equals

715
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:27,360
the one.

716
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:35,550
And the equation of
c*du/dx equalling the w.

717
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:38,710
I split it out for
you in the last part,

718
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:41,260
Problem 4b in the quiz.

719
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,520
I really helped you to
say OK, take these two

720
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,980
separate equations.

721
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,830
And now you don't
really have a problem.

722
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:55,350
The equation for w, nothing
is out of the ordinary there.

723
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,460
Jump in c is not even seen.

724
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,450
So then you've got the w.

725
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:04,100
Now, you have the c in
it with its little jump.

726
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:10,560
But, so suppose I find w
from the first equation.

727
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,250
How do I find u?

728
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,870
I just divide by the c.

729
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,720
And integrate.

730
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,900
Yeah.

731
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,350
What I'm saying, let
me say it, clearly now.

732
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:29,250
If there's a jump in c,
that's not a bad thing.

733
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:34,780
Because the point is
there's no jump in c*u'.

734
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:39,070
c*du/dx doesn't
jump. w doesn't jump.

735
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,300
From a jump in c.

736
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,850
If c jumps, let it.

737
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:49,790
There's no jump in w, which
is the serious unknown.

738
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:52,560
There'll be a jump
in du/dx, and that

739
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,550
was that e thing that
you had on the quiz.

740
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:00,090
There'll be a jump in du/dx
to compensate the jump in c,

741
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,440
but w is good.

742
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,040
That's the message of--
So let me write that down.

743
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:22,700
Even if c jumps, w does not.

744
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,860
So my point is when
you're looking at w,

745
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,240
you're looking at
the right quantity.

746
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:35,040
And it deals, this is the
sort of general feature

747
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,990
that if you look at it
right it's not a problem.

748
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:43,010
If you look at it wrong and
try to write out that equation,

749
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:45,930
take the second
derivative of this is OK,

750
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:48,770
but then if you just try to
take the derivative of the jump,

751
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:51,180
you think, my God
there's a delta function

752
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:55,870
sitting in my equation,
what am I to do.

753
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:59,750
Don't do it.

754
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:07,380
That pair of equations
is no trouble.

755
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,460
Do you see that point?

756
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:17,700
That a jump in c is really OK.
c=0 wouldn't be so good, right?

757
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,940
If c went to zero then you
have got some problems here,

758
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,560
because if c is zero
here what's going on?

759
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:35,440
So your material should
have some stiffness,

760
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
some positive stiffness.

761
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,250
Zero stiffness
would be a problem.

762
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,980
Negative stiffness
would be really

763
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,940
a crazy material, where
you add more force

764
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:52,460
and it compresses on you.

765
00:46:52,460 --> 00:47:00,890
OK so that was a point I could
make also in the lecture.

766
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,250
Other questions.

767
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:09,450
I hope you find these
review sessions--

768
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:16,510
They give a chance to
bring out more points.

769
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,900
Let me say a little bit
about Chapter 2 things

770
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:26,270
that we abandoned without
including in the lectures.

771
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:30,130
One very important thing
that we didn't touch

772
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,670
was the non-linear problems.

773
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:40,550
Where in the end you
have to solve a system

774
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:43,020
of non-linear equations.

775
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,090
We've only had linear
equations, Ku=f,

776
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:52,010
where we almost got to-- And
we've certainly found enough

777
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,750
to discuss there.

778
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,840
But how do you deal with
non-linear equations?

779
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:03,650
Well so that's
Section 2.6, I guess.

780
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:09,060
And the answer is Newton's
method, or some version,

781
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,620
there are many versions
of Newton's method.

782
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:18,720
So all I'm saying is
that's an important topic.

783
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,060
How to deal with
non-linear equations.

784
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:27,020
And the answer is usually some
variation of Newton's method.

785
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,110
Depending on how
many equations you've

786
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:34,230
got, how bad the non-linearity
is, and things like that.

787
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:40,720
It's a case where
coding is not so simple.

788
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,330
But important.

789
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:45,380
So that's one thing in
Chapter 2 that we've

790
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:51,280
passed, because really this
is where we want to be today.

791
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,140
Other topics,
questions of any kind?

792
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:54,860
Yes, thanks.

793
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

794
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:58,870
PROFESSOR STRANG:
This problem, OK.

795
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,825
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

796
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:02,700
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes

797
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:16,960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Well, OK.

798
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,230
Right, good question.

799
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:20,210
You're right.

800
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:25,040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

801
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,220
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah, OK.

802
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,700
So now suppose that delta
of x was in-- delta of x-a,

803
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,490
the jump at a, was there.

804
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:38,870
What would change in there?

805
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,920
Well, the one would
change, right?

806
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,370
The one would now
be the delta of x-a.

807
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:48,300
So what am I seeing now?

808
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,290
What's the jump situation now?

809
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:56,760
Is there a jump in, does w jump
now from this delta function?

810
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,250
Yes.

811
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,990
It did not jump
from the jump in c.

812
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:04,070
That did not produce
us a jump in w.

813
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:04,670
Why not?

814
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:13,690
Because again, back to the jump
in c, you have a bar of copper

815
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,370
and you have a bar of steel.

816
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:19,030
And they have different c's.

817
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:24,090
But the force at that point,
when it's in equilibrium,

818
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:28,410
the bar's not
falling apart, right?

819
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:33,440
The force is the same from above
and below; equilibrium holds.

820
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,290
It's just that the force
involves a c_1 there,

821
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:45,260
and down here the force involves
a c_2 multiplying the du/dx,

822
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,790
and this stretching.

823
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:50,980
So the stretching
rule changes. du/dx,

824
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,800
the stretching factor will be
different in the two materials.

825
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,160
But the force won't be.

826
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,430
You really have to
keep straight what--

827
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,740
Now, you asked about
a delta function, OK.

828
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,450
So now if I hang a
delta function there,

829
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:08,830
that's like hanging a
point load at a point.

830
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:10,430
What happens at that point?

831
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:14,640
Well, we don't have
a problem with that.

832
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,670
Well, w jumps.

833
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:21,190
The force pulling up is
not the same as the force

834
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,490
pulling down because there's
this extra point load.

835
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:29,080
So the balance there
and the balance there,

836
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,660
those aren't equal.

837
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:35,730
There's a jump there because of
the point load being put there.

838
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:40,470
So that produces a jump
in w, but not a jump in u.

839
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:46,160
Not a jump in u, the bar
is still holding together.

840
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,340
And since time's
running out I don't

841
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:55,510
have to ask myself, or ask you,
about the worst possibility

842
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,940
that occurs to me,
which is suppose

843
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,230
they happen at the same place.

844
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:06,500
Suppose there's a jump
in c and a point load.

845
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:12,030
Do we want to face that,
what would happen there?

846
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:17,300
Suppose, a was the
place where this jumped.

847
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,070
Suppose the point load was here.

848
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,890
What's up there?

849
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:24,020
Well, maybe I will
able to do that.

850
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,540
OK, so I'm putting
the point load

851
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:32,670
at the place where the
copper and the steel meet.

852
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:34,950
Is w continuous?

853
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:39,040
Is the force the same
above and below that joint?

854
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:39,600
No.

855
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:44,560
Because there's these extra
terms from the weight.

856
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,100
And then once you
know the forces, then

857
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:52,560
above the bar you're solving
for u with one c, and then

858
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,830
below that point
with the other c.

859
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:03,930
So w has a plus and a minus
and c has a plus and a minus.

860
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:12,120
And you're solving this one,
let me make them minus plus.

861
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:17,610
So you're solving this
one in one bar, one metal.

862
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:20,800
And c plus and the w
plus in the other method.

863
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,660
So yeah, you can do it.

864
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:30,200
Shall I just repeat what
my overall message is?

865
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,690
w is the right thing to look at.

866
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:38,090
That combination c*du/dx is
the right thing to look at.

867
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:43,050
And it's what sits there.

868
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,650
In those parentheses.

869
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:50,630
OK, good, so that's
some review topics.

870
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:54,090
We really have a lot of fun
ahead now with finite elements.
