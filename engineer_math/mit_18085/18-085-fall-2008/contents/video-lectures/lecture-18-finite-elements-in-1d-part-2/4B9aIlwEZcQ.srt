9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,390
PROFESSOR STRANG: So.

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:27,600
I got the preparation
for finite elements.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,060
Again we're in one
dimension, because that's

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,620
where you can see first and most
clearly how the system works.

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,120
So the system was, really,
to begin with the weak form

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,020
that I introduced last time.

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,780
The Galerkin idea
that I introduced just

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,940
at the very end of last
time, and that idea

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,250
is that instead of the
continuous differential

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,640
equations where--
Galerkin's idea

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,230
is how do you make it
discrete, and he'll

20
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,240
choose some trial functions.

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,490
Those are functions.

22
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,870
And some test function.

23
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,980
And I didn't get to
say, but I'll say now,

24
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,450
very often they're the same.

25
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,820
So very often the phis
are the same as the V's.

26
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,970
And probably they will be
in all my examples today.

27
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:28,770
And then what's new today is,
what choices would you make?

28
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,230
You have pretty wide choice,
but there are some natural ones

29
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,420
to start with.

30
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,460
And so that's
where we are today.

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,070
And then also the
other part of today

32
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:48,240
is how do we get from all that
preparation to the equations

33
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,830
that we actually solve.

34
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,430
The KU=F, where does
the K come from,

35
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,100
where does the F come from?

36
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,950
The F is going to come,
of course, somehow

37
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,060
from this right-hand
side and the K

38
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,220
is going to come
from the left side.

39
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,210
OK, so that's the
overall direction

40
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,240
if you want to know how
finite elements work,

41
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,320
that's the key line there.

42
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,640
And then here I've recalled
what the step was, here's

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,350
our differential equation.

44
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,800
And there's its weak form.

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,020
This is the weak form.

46
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,130
And let me put this in.

47
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,940
Here I've reproduced
what we reached

48
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,260
last time, the weak form.

49
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,160
That was the strong form
with its boundary conditions;

50
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,900
now we get the weak form
with its boundary conditions.

51
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,390
And the weak form
involves u, so it's

52
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,200
the boundary conditions
on u, the fixed ones,

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,530
that get used in the weak form.

54
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,350
The free ones don't
appear in the weak form,

55
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:02,540
but by the magic of
integration by parts,

56
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,960
the free ones will sort of
come out in a natural way.

57
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,820
But we have to build in the
essential, Dirichlet boundary

58
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,640
conditions like that
fixed right-hand end.

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:22,620
OK, and because I think of v as
a little movement away from u,

60
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,420
but my u's are all
fixed at the end,

61
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,530
therefore v has
to be fixed, too.

62
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:35,540
OK, so this is important.

63
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,320
But we haven't made
it down to Earth yet.

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,260
We were doing a lot
of ideas last time,

65
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,830
which are the center of
things, but now let's

66
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,450
get down to Earth.

67
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,950
And down to Earth really means,
what functions do we choose?

68
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,040
And then how do we
get the equation.

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,240
So that's the job today,
the principal job and this

70
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,040
is of course what
you would actually

71
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,490
code up to run a finite
element simulation.

72
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,830
You would make a decision
on these functions.

73
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,170
And let's start with
piecewise linear functions.

74
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:22,070
So a typical phi is
maybe centered at a node,

75
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,150
so it goes up and down.

76
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:33,450
So if that's node two,
let's number these nodes:

77
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:40,520
one, two, three, four, and five.

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,600
Well, that's five there but
I'm going to have, let's see.

79
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,850
What do I have here?

80
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:52,640
At a typical node,
two, my function

81
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:59,670
is zero except in the
intervals that touch node two.

82
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,140
So here's phi_2.

83
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,530
phi_2(x).

84
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,295
That's its graph.

85
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:07,500
It comes along, it's
piecewise linear up,

86
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,010
it's piecewise linear back
down, and it's zero again.

87
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,310
So that would be phi_2.

88
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,190
Then phi_1, there'll be a phi_1.

89
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,410


90
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,740
Like so, exactly similar.

91
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,640
The whole point is
keep the system simple.

92
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,330
That's what the finite
element idea is.

93
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,110
Use simple functions
for the phis.

94
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,390
And I'm taking them
also to be the test

95
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,510
function v. Keep those simple.

96
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,850
Now, what about
at the boundaries?

97
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,350
OK, well we've said our
functions have to be,

98
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,390
I'm doing free-fixed.

99
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:54,890
So fixed comes to zero there and
all my functions will do that.

100
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,180
But this end is
free, so watch this.

101
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,910
This is another, what
I'll call a half-hat.

102
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,970
If I call those hat
functions is that OK?

103
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,270
It makes a nice short word.

104
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,060
So these are hat functions.

105
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,600
And then a fuller description
would be piecewise linear,

106
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,190
but hat functions is clear.

107
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,770
OK, now notice I'm sticking
in here what I maybe

108
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,690
could call a half-hat.

109
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,050
Because my V's and
my phis, my functions

110
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,510
are not constrained
at that left-hand end.

111
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,810
That's free.

112
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,610
So there's a phi_1,
and there's a phi_0.

113
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,120
And a phi_3, and a phi_4.

114
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,020
So altogether, I'm
going to have five.

115
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,340
And I've started the
numbering at zero,

116
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,600
I guess it just happens.

117
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
So let's accept that.

118
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,670
So I'm going to
have five functions.

119
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,560
And they will also be
my five test functions.

120
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,570
So let me first think of
them as the trial functions.

121
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,070
Phi.

122
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,460
So what was the point
about trial functions?

123
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,160
The point about is, my
approximate, my finite element

124
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,170
solution U(x) is going to
be a combination of those.

125
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,440
Some U_0, times
the phi_0 function,

126
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:29,887
up to U_4 times
the phi_4 function.

127
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:30,970
And these are my unknowns.

128
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,830
U_0, U_1, those numbers.

129
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,980
I have five unknowns.

130
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,030
And I'm using hat functions.

131
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:45,240
So I should, really, why
don't I draw a graph of U(x).

132
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,910
So I don't need the
words piecewise linear.

133
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,870
You see, I have a kind
of space of functions.

134
00:07:53,870 --> 00:08:01,080
My functions are all,
my approximations

135
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,080
are combinations of these
fixed basis functions.

136
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,530
You could call these phis, trial
functions, basis functions,

137
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,100
you're always choosing,
in applied math,

138
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:19,880
a bunch of functions whose
combinations are going to be,

139
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,660
is what you're
going to work with.

140
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,500
And here I'm making
them hat functions.

141
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,160
OK, so what does a combination
of those guys look like?

142
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,310
I'll even erase the
word hat functions;

143
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,860
we won't forget that.

144
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,090
So what would a
combination of-- Here's

145
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:42,470
the same interval zero, one,
with the same mesh, one, two,

146
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,790
three, four guys inside.

147
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:50,590
What would-- It just helps
the visualization to see.

148
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:57,360
If I combine these guys, so
those were, despite the way

149
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,920
it might look, that's
one separate function.

150
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,660
Two, three, four and five.

151
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,860
And now suppose I
take a combination.

152
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,060
What kind of a
function do I get?

153
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,230
How would you describe this,
a combination like this?

154
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,710
Of those five guys?

155
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,890
What will it look like?

156
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:25,280
Between every node it will
be a straight line, right?

157
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,220
Because all these guys are
straight, between those.

158
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,010
So a typical function
will start at what?

159
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:36,880
This height will be
U_0, because, well

160
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,000
let me draw a few things.

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,020
OK, so I'll put U_0 a
little higher because I

162
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,830
want to end up down at zero.

163
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:49,140
So that might be the height U_0,
and U_1 might be pretty close.

164
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,820
U_2 might be coming down a bit.

165
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,120
Coming down a bit,
coming down a bit.

166
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,850
And ending at zero.

167
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,610
So those were meant
to be corners.

168
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,570
That wasn't a very good bit.

169
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,750
There, OK.

170
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,260
It wasn't meant to be, yeah.

171
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,720
So that height is U_0.

172
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,330
Now, notice why?

173
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,210
Why is that?

174
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,440
Why is the coefficient
of phi_0 exactly

175
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,210
the height, the
displacement, at zero?

176
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,490
Because all the
other phis are zero.

177
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,390
All the other phis are
zero at this point.

178
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,980
Only this guy's coming in.

179
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:42,010
So we'll only see in
this, at this point,

180
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,130
see, even phi_1 has
dropped to zero.

181
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,640
So we're only going to
see phi_0 times U_0.

182
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,930
So, I should have said, we take
all these heights to be one.

183
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,380
Height is one.

184
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,060
Course it doesn't matter
because we're multiplying

185
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,680
by u's, but so let's settle.

186
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,540
They all have heights one.

187
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,260
And this is sort of a key part
of the finite element idea.

188
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,910
You see, Galerkin,
when he created

189
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,470
just two or three
functions phi, he

190
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,700
tried to follow
the exact solution.

191
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,651
He had an idea in his mind what
the solution to the problem

192
00:11:21,651 --> 00:11:22,150
will be.

193
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,370
And he wanted to take two
or three functions that

194
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,200
would get him close to it.

195
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,530
Here we choose the
functions, they're

196
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,470
in the finite element
library before we even

197
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,490
know what the equation is,
or the boundary conditions.

198
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:42,820
These functions are like,
the hat function choice.

199
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,810
And they have this beautiful
sort of a connect to nodes.

200
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,510
In a way where-- In fact, I
got involved in finite elements

201
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,370
in the first place
just to understand

202
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,700
what's the difference
between finite elements

203
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,470
and finite differences.

204
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,340
Because the finite
elements, as you'll see,

205
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,130
are associated with nodes.
phi_1 is the only guy

206
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,660
that's not zero at node one.

207
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,570
And therefore, what
will this height be?

208
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,440
What's that height?

209
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,780
So that maybe comes
down a little.

210
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,530
What's this height?

211
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,720
U_1.

212
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,000
It's the coefficient of phi_1,
because phi_1 is sitting there.

213
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,320
And all the other
phis are zero there,

214
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,650
so this height is really U_1.

215
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:33,860
And U_2, and U_3, and
U_4, and U_5 is zero.

216
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:41,410
So that was U_1, U_2, and so on.

217
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,070
What I'm saying is, and
we'll see it happen,

218
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:49,530
is that this KU=F equation
that we finally get to is going

219
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,310
to look very like a finite
difference equation.

220
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,640
But it's coming from
this different direction.

221
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:04,640
And this way allows
many more possibilities,

222
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,170
gets things sort of
more naturally right.

223
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,060
It takes less-- With the
finite difference equation,

224
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,020
we had to go in there and
decide what it should be.

225
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,330
With finite elements, our
decision is just the phis.

226
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,750
Once we've decided
the phis, Galerkin

227
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,730
tells us what the equation is.

228
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,430
And we'll get to the
KU=F, what it is.

229
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:38,300
But here I'm getting you to see
what our approximate solution

230
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,230
can look like.

231
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,490
And this beautiful fact that
the coefficients in here

232
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,740
have a physical meaning.

233
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,730
They're actually
the displacements

234
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,540
at the nodes for these
simple functions.

235
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,390
OK.

236
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,710
You got a picture of what
the trial functions are,

237
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:02,930
some people would think about
the functions as these guys.

238
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,620
Other people might think of
this picture, the combinations.

239
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,290
So those are the
individual basis functions.

240
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,330
That's a typical combination
of the typical one.

241
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:21,750
OK, so we're looking for
an equation for these U's.

242
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,390
Five equations, of course.

243
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,720
Because we've got five U's.

244
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,520
So that's my final step here.

245
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,420
What are the five
equations for the five U's.

246
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,410
And those are the equations
that I'm going to call KU=F. OK.

247
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,910
So here's now a critical moment.

248
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,790
Where do the
equations come from?

249
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,830
Well, the equations
come from the weak form.

250
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,270
So I take the weak form.

251
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:59,730
And in for u, for u here,
I guess it's just there.

252
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,540
I put this.

253
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,320
I put capital U.
So can I just copy,

254
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,510
this is the weak form for
before we've made it discrete.

255
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,470
Before we've chosen n phis.

256
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,980
OK, now let's choose the
n phis, so now this'll

257
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,360
be the weak form.

258
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:27,170
Again, the weak
form with Galerkin.

259
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,764
After the decision.

260
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:30,555
So it'll be the integral,
from zero to one,

261
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,290
of this c(x), whatever it is.

262
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:39,810
Times the U(x)-- sorry, times
the dU/dx, right? dU/dx,

263
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,070
so what is dU/dx?

264
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,300
Oh, you have to pay attention.

265
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,870
This was a true solution.

266
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,090
Little u.

267
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,940
But now this is
where I'm working.

268
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:58,560
I'm working with capital U. So
instead of the d little u dx,

269
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,350
it's d capital U dx.

270
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,580
Maybe I'll put it in
there. d capital U dx.

271
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,500
And then I'll put
down here what it is.

272
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,160
What is it?

273
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:15,210
It's U_0*phi_0, can I use
prime just to-- Or d phi_0/dx,

274
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,620
whatever?

275
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,740
Can I use prime for derivative?

276
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,690
Just save a little space.

277
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,980
So this is the
derivative of my guy.

278
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:32,010
U_1*phi_1'(x), up
to whatever it was.

279
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,190
U_4*phi_4'(x).

280
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,180


281
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,680
That's what that term is.

282
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,750
And that multiplies dv/dx.

283
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:50,650
Where v is, here v
is any test function.

284
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:54,700
Any test function, only
required to have v(1)=0.

285
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,010
But now, I'm going discrete.

286
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:06,260
So instead of any test function,
I'll use these five functions.

287
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,110
So I've got five functions.

288
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,660
The phis are the same
as the V's, then.

289
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,420
V_1, V_2, V_3 and V_4.

290
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,230
Same guys.

291
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:24,570
So now I'll put in
dV, can I say dV_i/dx?

292
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,830


293
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,825
And on the right hand side I
have the integral from zero

294
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:47,450
to one of f(x)*V_i(x)dx, i is
zero, one, two, three, or four.

295
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,690
I'm testing against five V's.

296
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:55,630
So I have this equation
for five different V's.

297
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,770
So i equals zero,
one, two, three, four,

298
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,050
gives me my five equations.

299
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,350
Here are my five unknowns.

300
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,500
This is my five by five system.

301
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,950
Let me just step back a minute
so you see what happened there.

302
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,420
So what do you have to do?

303
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:19,120
You chose the basis functions,
the phis and the V's.

304
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,550
Then you just plug into the
weak form, you plug in dU/dx,

305
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,350
is coming from there.

306
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,360
So this is dU/dx.

307
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,980
You have to plug dV/dx, you
have to do the integrals.

308
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,480
You have to do the
integrals, that's

309
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,420
something we didn't have
in finite differences.

310
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,530
Finite elements involves
doing the integrals, left side

311
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,880
and right-hand side.

312
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,570
OK, so, and here we have five
different integrals to do.

313
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,710
We have f(x) times
each V. This will be,

314
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,770
this number will be F_i.

315
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:06,890
So my F vector is going to
be an F_0, F_1, down to F_4.

316
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,830
The five guys that I get
from these five integrals.

317
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,700
Alright.

318
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,570
And the K matrix is
sitting here somewhere.

319
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,800
That's the last thing,
that's the final thing,

320
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,070
is to see what is the K matrix.

321
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,510
Which is coming.

322
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,840
This is somehow K's times
U's are sitting here.

323
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,340
F's are sitting over there.

324
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,500
So it may be good to
see the F's first.

325
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,740
So do you see this now?

326
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,840
We made the choices,
then what's our job?

327
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:44,250
Our next job is to do
all the integrations.

328
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,380
Integrate my function against V.

329
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,840
Let's make the natural
first example, let f be one.

330
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,220
First example, let f be one.

331
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,360
All right.

332
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:08,670
So if f is one, I'm going
to find the system KU=F.

333
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:15,140
So if I know f(x) is one, then
I have everything I need to find

334
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,830
these numbers.

335
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:23,800
OK, actually we can
probably do those by,

336
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,500
you can probably tell
me what they are.

337
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,400
If f(x) is one, now.

338
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,910
So this is example one.
f(x) is a constant.

339
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,110
One we have solved before.

340
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,260
What's the integral of V_0?

341
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,390
Right, that's what I have to do.

342
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,790
What's the integral of
this, f(x) being one,

343
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,800
I'm just asking, I
just have V_0(x)?

344
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,640
The integral of V_0(x),
and let me again draw V_0,

345
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,010
which is phi_0.

346
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:01,230
It's a half hat and then
it goes along at zero.

347
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,060
What's the integral
of that function?

348
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,600
One, yeah.

349
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,710
How do I think
about that integral?

350
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,750
It's the area of the triangle.

351
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,480
It's the area.

352
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,460
That's what an integral
is, it's the area.

353
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:20,670
So the area is, I've
got delta x there.

354
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,750
Right, delta x as the base.

355
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,870
One as the height, and
you see the formula

356
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:31,880
for the area of a triangle, it's
got a half in there somewhere,

357
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,580
right?

358
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,390
A half.

359
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,950
OK, can I factor
out the delta x?

360
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,860
Because the delta x
is going to come in.

361
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,380
I think there's a half there.

362
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,940
And then what about F_1?

363
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:51,740
What's the integral of this
times V_1(x), the next V?

364
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,900
It's the area under
this dashed function.

365
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,960
Which is now the basis 2
delta x, so I get a one.

366
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,260
Is that right?

367
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,450
I get a one, one, one, one.

368
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,570
OK, so that was obviously
not too tough, right?

369
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:17,090
That was straightforward
and notice something.

370
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,640
Even here, in fact,
we see it here.

371
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,980
I don't know if you
remember about that half.

372
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,110
Do you remember something about
when we did finite differences

373
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,970
and we had a free boundary?

374
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,810
And we lost an order of accuracy
if we didn't do it right?

375
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,030
Do you remember that?

376
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,120
At the fixed boundary
we were fine,

377
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,570
but with finite differences
at a free boundary,

378
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,170
where I was using the
matrix T. With one,

379
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:55,650
minus one at the top row, I
lost an order of accuracy.

380
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,670
Unless I made some change
on the right-hand side.

381
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,350
Look what's happening.

382
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,790
The finite element method
is making the change for me

383
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,340
on the right hand side.

384
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,250
So the finite element method
is going to automatically keep

385
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,420
the second order accuracy.

386
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,840
Keep the second order accuracy.

387
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,030
So that's a key point.

388
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,050
That these piecewise
linear functions

389
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:27,310
are associated with
second order accuracy.

390
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,950
Later we'll move
up to parabolas,

391
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,660
to cubics; that will move
up the order of accuracy

392
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,380
in a nice way.

393
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,950
Where with finite
differences we would have

394
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:42,620
had to create new finite
difference formulas.

395
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,370
Our minus one, two,
minus one formula,

396
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,350
that was good for
second order accuracy.

397
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,990
Then we would have
to figure out,

398
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,010
in the quiz had
partly started it,

399
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:57,820
what if there's a c(x)
in there, what do you do?

400
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,230
Finite differences, there's
more thinking involved.

401
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,090
Finite elements is like
just press the button.

402
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,410
Well, there's a little more
to it than that of course,

403
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,520
because it's taking
a full lecture.

404
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:17,930
But in the end it's more
systematic, you could say.

405
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:22,390
So that's the F. Now
are you ready for the K?

406
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,590
So this is the key part, OK?

407
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:30,620
So you have to can get
this thing to simplify.

408
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,820
So what am I looking for here?

409
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,050
This whole left-hand
side should be K times U.

410
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:45,520
So I'm looking to see what
multiplies-- I'm looking

411
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,700
to make sense out of this.

412
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,740
What's the first equation?

413
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,910
Right, so the first equation or
the zeroth equation, I guess.

414
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,540
The zeroth equation,
the one that'll

415
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,730
run along and have
this right-hand side,

416
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:05,770
the zeroth equation is the
equation when i is zero.

417
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,250
It's the equation that
comes from testing

418
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,510
our weak form for V_0.

419
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,200
For that particular form.

420
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,260
Maybe I'll just start
over on this board.

421
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,750
Then I can write a
formula, but I'd rather you

422
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,120
see how it comes.

423
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,680
So I'm looking at equation zero.

424
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,040
So take i=0.

425
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,630


426
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:41,350
So I have my left side
is my integral, of c(x).

427
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,150
Times this combination that
I wrote, U_0*phi_0' plus...

428
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,770


429
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:59,240
U_4*phi_4', times
dV_0/dx*dx equal,

430
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,020
and on the right side
is where I got the F_0,

431
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,440
which I already figured out
to be delta x times a half.

432
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,890
It's the left side that
I'm worrying about.

433
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:14,100
OK, you see what's
happening here?

434
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:19,800
This is some matrix.

435
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,960
Its zeroth row is what we're
finding -- multiplying U_0,

436
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:34,360
U_1, U_2, U_3, and U_4
-- equaling the F vector.

437
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,590
I'm supposed to be getting
the first row of the matrix,

438
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:42,980
the top row of the matrix,
from the top V. OK,

439
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,440
so let's just do these.

440
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,900
We've got integrals to do again.

441
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,830
Alright, what is dV_0/dx?

442
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,270


443
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,100
Do you see?

444
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,970
Let me just see?

445
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:02,240
What number is going in here?

446
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,810
What number is going in there?

447
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,490
Yeah, if we see
that we're golden.

448
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,100
What number is going in there?

449
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:15,920
That's the thing that multiplies
U_0 in the first row that

450
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,930
means I should use V_0, so this
is the point, this is K_00.

451
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,850
And what's its formula?

452
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,060
You realize I'm starting
the count at zero

453
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:33,040
because all these
counts-- So what is K_00?

454
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
It's an integral.

455
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,000
Of what? c(x), good.

456
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,360
Times this guy, because it's
multiplying, times this guy,

457
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,530
V_0', dx.

458
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,600
That's what you have to do.

459
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,050
That's what you have
to do. c(x) times

460
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:03,450
phi', it's phi_0', that's
what would sit there.

461
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:11,720
And maybe, well, let's
figure that one, shall we?

462
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,300
I have to know c(x), right,
that's part of the problem.

463
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,230
What would you like
me to choose for c(x)?

464
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:18,730
One.

465
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,890
Thank you.

466
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,570
I'll choose one.

467
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,940
Let this be one.

468
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,900
Or I could make it
capital C and you

469
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,770
would see a capital C appearing
everywhere, but let's make it

470
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,410
one.

471
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,270
So what are we doing now?

472
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,230
What's our equation?

473
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:37,050
Our right-hand side is
one, our c(x) is one,

474
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:41,500
our equation has
reduced to -u''=1.

475
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,260
The first equation
in the course.

476
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:50,360
So we're back to September
the 3rd or whatever it was.

477
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,830
But doing it now
by finite elements.

478
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,960
OK, so let c(x) be one and
tell me what this integral is.

479
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,790
So c(x) is now, we're
taking-- In our problem,

480
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,570
we're supposing it's one.

481
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:11,700
Let me just say:
Suppose it's function.

482
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:20,230
Then we have lots of integrals
to do involving that function.

483
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,050
And we might not do them
exactly, that would be alright.

484
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:29,460
It's certainly totally OK to
do the integrals approximately,

485
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,140
because we're doing
everything else approximately.

486
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,910
So we just have to be sure
that we do the integrals

487
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:39,330
with sufficient accuracy so
that we don't lose accuracy

488
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,780
in the integrals.

489
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,810
Of course, with
a one we're going

490
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,420
to do the integral exactly.

491
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,550
But if c(x) was some
variable function,

492
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,320
I wouldn't have
to do it exactly,

493
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,940
I would just have to do
it with enough accuracy

494
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,010
so that I don't
lose extra accuracy

495
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:02,510
beyond what I'm losing in the
whole Galerkin approximation.

496
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,250
OK, ready for that number.

497
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:11,490
What number comes out of that?
phi_0', let's graph phi_0'.

498
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,520
And of course it's the
same as V_0', so can I

499
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,850
put a little graph here?

500
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:22,442
Here is zero to one, and
I'm going to graph phi_0'.

501
00:30:22,442 --> 00:30:23,150
So what's phi_0'?

502
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,230


503
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,850
Oh, it's negative, isn't it?

504
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,870
My little graph
isn't going to work.

505
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,390
I didn't leave enough room.

506
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:39,319
It's negative.

507
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,610
So I'll just write it in words.

508
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,110
It's the same as
V_0', and what is it?

509
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:50,290
Tell me what it is, what's the
derivative of that function?

510
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:52,180
It's what?

511
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,830
Negative one.

512
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,300
Wait a minute.

513
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,070
Yeah, it's going to have
a certain value, yeah.

514
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,640
You can tell me what it is
beyond that point real fast.

515
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:15,270
So it's something up to
delta-- So what is the slope?

516
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:20,140
What's that slope
there, of phi_0?

517
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:25,790
It's not negative one, because
remember, what's the base here?

518
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:30,610
That's not the point
one, I'm sorry.

519
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:36,590
All these were delta x's.

520
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,790
Those were just
numbering the nodes.

521
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:43,200
But the actual length
scale is the delta x scale.

522
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,150
So now tell me what it is.

523
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:52,280
The derivative is negative
one over delta x, right?

524
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,290
It dropped by one when it
went across by delta x.

525
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:02,690
And this is only up to node one.

526
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:06,890
Up to delta x and
then zero afterwards.

527
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,050
This is a key point.

528
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:14,450
That all our
functions are local.

529
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,800
Our functions are local.

530
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,810
What does that mean?

531
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:23,650
You can tell me what am I
going to get when I integrate,

532
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,160
for example, when later
on I might be integrating

533
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,250
phi_1' against V_4'.

534
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,380


535
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,240
What's the answer?

536
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,130
This is the key point.

537
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,060
Later, when I'm looking
for the one, four entry,

538
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:47,260
when I'm looking there,
I'm going to do an integral

539
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,760
of phi_1'.

540
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,790
I'll erase for a moment
and do this in my head.

541
00:32:54,790 --> 00:33:01,180
When I integrate
phi_1' against V_4'.

542
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:06,480
Maybe it's the fourth row.

543
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,480
And the first guy over, maybe
it's this guy I'm doing.

544
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,950
Doesn't matter a whole lot.

545
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:16,900
Because the answer is,
when I integrate phi_1'

546
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:22,500
against V_4' just, it's
nice to get the easy ones.

547
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,620
It's zero.

548
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,460
Why is it zero?

549
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,350
Why is the integral of
phi_1' against V_4' zero?

550
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:37,820
Because these phis are local.
phi_1' is only non-zero here.

551
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,240
V_4' is only non-zero over here.

552
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,420
The two don't overlap.

553
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,570
Anywhere the one is not
zero, the other is zero.

554
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,870
So that's a zero there.

555
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:59,840
In fact, our overlaps, I'm just
sort of looking ahead here.

556
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,740
Our overlaps, a phi
overlaps itself, of course.

557
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,850
And its right-hand neighbor
and its left-hand neighbor.

558
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:13,070
But nobody two or
three or more away.

559
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:19,420
I think our K, all our integrals
are going to be zero outside,

560
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,540
we'll have another
tri-diagonal matrix.

561
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,700
We're going to have
zeroes all here.

562
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:36,610
And we'll only have
entries of phi against V

563
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,480
when they're either the
same or just differ by one.

564
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,340
So we'll only have
three diagonals.

565
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,430
OK, we were about to find
out what that number is.

566
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:53,170
So the slope of this is
minus one over delta x,

567
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:59,410
and that's-- I'm sorry, let
me go back to zero, zero.

568
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,460
OK.

569
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,560
This is what we're keeping
our fingers crossed for.

570
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,810
What's that number?

571
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:15,690
So I have this thing,
actually is it just squared?

572
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,320
And that's the slope.

573
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,340
And then the phi and the
V I'm choosing the same,

574
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,520
so that's the slope again.

575
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,070
I think I'm just
getting one over delta

576
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:30,610
x squared for that times
that times the one.

577
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,630
So what's K_00?

578
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,100
One over delta x.

579
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,940
Where'd the delta x come from?

580
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:44,120
Because we're only integrating
over, it looks like zero to one

581
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,310
but they're all zero.

582
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,070
We're really only
integrating, the only reality

583
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,750
was out to node one.

584
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,500
Out to delta x.

585
00:35:53,500 --> 00:36:00,750
You see that the number there,
the number here on the diagonal

586
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:08,620
is one over delta x.

587
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:14,340
OK, how about doing K_11 for me?

588
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,570
So again, now these guys
will be the same guys.

589
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,320
It's a square.

590
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,860
No it's the integral phi_1'
against V_1', they're the same.

591
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:32,090
And what is phi_1', which
is the same as V_1'?

592
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,430
What's the derivative now?

593
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,730
It's, ah.

594
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,650
What's the slope
of this function?

595
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,520
It goes up and goes
back down, right?

596
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,880
I have a plus part,
so the slope going up

597
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,280
is the one over delta x.

598
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,250
And then the slope coming down
is minus one over delta x.

599
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:04,270
So this was up to
delta x and then

600
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,900
to two delta x, and then zero.

601
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,590
That's a much more
typical thing,

602
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,110
the slope goes the
function, the hat function

603
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,450
goes up to the top of the hat.

604
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,140
Back down.

605
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,360
The slope up and the
slope down are easy.

606
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,680
And now the integral's easy.

607
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,490
So I'm just squaring,
well, when I square it,

608
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,930
this squared is the one
over delta x squared.

609
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,280
This is the same, because
the minus will get squared.

610
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,320
So what's K_11?

611
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,510
What's K_11 now?

612
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:46,120
Have you got K_11 in your head?

613
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,280
This is one over
delta x squared.

614
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,880
And now what is the integral?

615
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,830
Two over delta x.

616
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:04,160
Because now we're integrating
from zero to two delta x,

617
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,650
because that's where my
functions are going out

618
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,490
from zero to node two.

619
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,110
If the function's numbered one.

620
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:16,280
So it's two delta
x times this; I

621
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:22,670
think we get a two over
delta x on that diagonal.

622
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:28,040
Would you care to guess
the rest of the diagonal?

623
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:36,240
Yes, you tell me what's
K_22 and K_33 and K_44?

624
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,390
They're all the same.

625
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,110
We're just shifting over.

626
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:44,600
So two over delta
x goes down there.

627
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,050
Alright, one more to do.

628
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,820
One more integral to do.

629
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,000
This next guy.

630
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,520
So can you tell me what
do I get now for K_01?

631
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:07,310
K_01, so now this is the
case where I'm in row zero,

632
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:12,690
so this should be V_0, because
that tells me the row I'm in.

633
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,340
But phi_1.

634
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:17,900


635
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,420
What happens when I integrate,
just see the picture here.

636
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:30,590
Let me just draw it small.
phi_1', so let me draw phi_1.

637
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:33,130
And V_0.

638
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,720
OK.

639
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,340
But it's the
derivatives that I want.

640
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,500
It's the slopes that I want, OK?

641
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:45,250
So what do I get
from here on out?

642
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,580
Zero, because this
guy only got to there.

643
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,940
That's the half hat, the
first guy stopped at delta x.

644
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,020
So whatever is happening here is
going to be multiplied by zero.

645
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,460
So it's just here.

646
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:04,520
One delta x interval
for this one.

647
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,450
They just overlap in
one interval, of course.

648
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,590
This guy and its neighbor
only overlap in one interval.

649
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,750
And what's the deal
about the two slopes?

650
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,240
They're opposite.

651
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,170
One's coming down,
one's going up.

652
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,840
But the slopes are
one over delta x

653
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,510
and minus one over delta x.

654
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,934
Do you see what's
happening here?

655
00:40:25,934 --> 00:40:26,600
I'm integrating.

656
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,000
Here I have a slope
of one over delta x,

657
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,990
and here I have a slope
of minus one over delta x,

658
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,730
so I should multiply those.

659
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:41,950
Minus one over delta x squared,
integrate, what goes in K_01?

660
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:47,570
What's that number?

661
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:54,270
It's that times that
integrated, but now the integral

662
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,305
is only going
really out to delta

663
00:40:56,305 --> 00:41:01,400
x because basically I'm
just stopping there.

664
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,740
So-- But there's a minus now.

665
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,410
Because it's not the square.

666
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,950
It's this times its neighbor.

667
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,790
One's going up, and
one's going down.

668
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,570
So it's delta x
squared, and then

669
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:23,610
the length of the interval, this
is a minus one over delta x.

670
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:28,700
Would you care to guess
the rest of this matrix?

671
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,500
What's the rest
of that diagonal,

672
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,900
above the main diagonal?

673
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,930
It's all the same.

674
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:43,760
That stays the same,
because when I do phi_2*V_1,

675
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,440
my picture is just
like shifted over.

676
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,400
But I still have one coming
down, and one going up.

677
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,610
When I do phi_3*V_2, same thing.

678
00:41:53,610 --> 00:42:00,210
And if I do phi_1*V_2,
it'll be the same.

679
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,910
I'm going to get this
minus one over delta

680
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:07,470
x all the way on
that diagonal, also.

681
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,660
Symmetry.

682
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,990
It's going to come
out symmetric.

683
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,410
Actually, since
the course started

684
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,910
by speaking about
properties of matrices,

685
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,600
let me just say K is
going to turn out to be

686
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,510
symmetric positive definite.

687
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,350
And what's more,
for this example

688
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:27,040
we recognize K completely.

689
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,090
You will say: Why did you take
so long to get to this result?

690
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:40,840
K is the one over delta x
part times, what's the matrix?

691
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:47,480
It's T. It's T. So it's one,
minus one, minus one, two,

692
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,220
minus one, minus one, two, minus
one, minus one, two, minus one,

693
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,670
and I guess we had five of them.

694
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:01,180
Oh, but nobody there, right?

695
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,910
That's not there.

696
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:06,480
That fixed-- Why do we
not have a minus one?

697
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,040
Because we've got no,
there isn't a six.

698
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,990
That would be column-- We've
got one, two, three, four,

699
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:17,130
five columns; there's
no U_5, there's no V_5,

700
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,190
we've got them all.

701
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:27,760
And the F, so that-- So KU, this
thing multiplies U_0 to U_4,

702
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,330
to U_4, and it
produces F, which is

703
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:39,570
one over delta, which is what?

704
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:44,900
Oh, delta x is in
the numerator, right.

705
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:53,790
Times a half, one,
one, one and one.

706
00:43:53,790 --> 00:44:00,430
That is the finite
element system KU=F.

707
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:04,640
For this simple problem.

708
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,880
It's exactly what
finite differences did.

709
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,180
So you can see why my first
introduction to finite elements

710
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,370
was with the question:
what's the difference?

711
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:18,330
The finite element community
at that point, this

712
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:23,230
was like the golden
age of finite elements,

713
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:26,430
all this was just
beginning to be created.

714
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:33,140
These elements were being used.

715
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,440
Especially in civil and
structural engineering,

716
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,380
that's where a lot of the
earliest papers came out of.

717
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,260
And then, in a model problem
it didn't look anything new.

718
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,060
It looked like our original
finite difference matrix.

719
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:55,590
But there were some new things.

720
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:59,320
First, there was this new 1/2,
that we hadn't particularly

721
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,150
noticed with finite differences.

722
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,680
We, we could catch onto that.

723
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,740
Here's a minor difference.

724
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,390
You notice that the
delta x is-- Strictly

725
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:11,880
speaking the delta
x is up here then,

726
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,700
but when I divide
by delta x then I'm

727
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,990
back to the finite difference.

728
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,340
I have the one over
delta x squared,

729
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,090
it looks like finite
differences again.

730
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:24,040
So everything looks the same.

731
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:30,750
But, of course, if c(x) isn't
one or if f(x) isn't one,

732
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:31,380
oh yeah.

733
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:37,230
If c(x) isn't one then
I've got integrals to do.

734
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,850
I would approximate those.

735
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,150
And I could then come out
with something that would

736
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:43,360
look like a finite differences.

737
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,910
Let me take our other
favorite model problem.

738
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:51,300
What would be the F if,
yeah, here's a question.

739
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,680
What would be the right
side if my vector,

740
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,480
instead of being one, what's
my other favorite choice?

741
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,030
Delta.

742
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:08,770
So I take delta at x minus, let
me take delta at x minus 1/4,

743
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,070
first.

744
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,330
Suppose that's my f.

745
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:18,060
Then I've got to
change all these guys.

746
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,590
And what would they be?

747
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:24,780
What would be the
new right-hand side

748
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:33,090
when I have this point load?

749
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,840
I have to go back to
the integrals, right?

750
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,980
I have to go back to these guys.

751
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,440
These integrals,
with that new f,

752
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:49,310
this is now delta of x minus
a 1/4, times each V, times dx.

753
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:52,200
I have to integrate
delta of x minus 1/4

754
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,460
against every hat function.

755
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,560
And see what it equals?

756
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,380
And what will I get?

757
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,950
You're going to
tell me right away.

758
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:04,780
What are those integrals?

759
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,730
That's a point load at node one.

760
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:14,030
Times the V integrated
over the whole thing.

761
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:18,060
What do I get?

762
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,270
I get a one, yeah.

763
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:25,220
That integral is going to pick
out the value at a quarter.

764
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,100
Right, that's what the
delta function does,

765
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,020
the spike is at a quarter.

766
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:33,690
Has area one, so it picks
out the V_i at a quarter.

767
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,150
V_i at a quarter will be?

768
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:46,930
One for the-- I think we
get a [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].

769
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:55,430
Again a little bit what
our finite differences

770
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:59,140
suggested that we should do.

771
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,230
Alright, here's one
final one for today.

772
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:05,880
Suppose the delta
function is not at a node.

773
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,970
Suppose it's at 3/8.

774
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:13,680
Or it could be at
any point a, but let

775
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,870
me just take a typical, a
special one where I can do it.

776
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:22,280
Suppose the load is at 3/8.

777
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,000
What do I get for
the integrals now?

778
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,280
So now, it's delta
of x minus 3/8.

779
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:40,490
The spike is at this point here.

780
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:44,420
That's where delta is
now, spiking at 3/8.

781
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,670
Is that right?

782
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:51,380
We had 1/5, tell me what-- oh,
I should have had 1/5 before,

783
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,410
sorry.

784
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:55,230
Change that on the videotape.

785
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:59,800
All those 1/4s were--
That 1/4 was 1/5,

786
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,600
and now what do I want?

787
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,710
Three?

788
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:07,070
I wanted to take a nice
one that was halfway.

789
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,180
I just forgot what halfway was.

790
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,370
Where is halfway there?

791
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:16,100
3/10 now for delta.

792
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,850
So that was-- Before I
had it for when delta.

793
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:24,730
So previously was
delta at x minus 1/5

794
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:34,620
and now delta at x minus
3/10, what's the F now?

795
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,690
What's the F now?

796
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:39,810
So the spike is right in the
middle between one and two.

797
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,850
What's do those
integrals come out to be?

798
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:49,000
If I integrate delta function
times the different hats,

799
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,830
what do I get?

800
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:52,980
What do I get, yeah.

801
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,960
I get a zero for this
first guy because it

802
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,880
didn't touch the half hat.

803
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,150
And then what do I get there?

804
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:01,190
Half.

805
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:03,480
And what do I get
at the next one?

806
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,750
Half again.

807
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,630
And then the other
guys it doesn't touch.

808
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,970
You see, it
automatically does it.

809
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,980
Does those smart things.

810
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,800
It automatically makes
the smart choice.

811
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:21,700
And if the spike was
at a, at any point a,

812
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,770
then at that typical
point a wherever it is,

813
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:27,830
like there, spike
could be there.

814
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,840
Then I would have, what would
I have if the spike was there?

815
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:36,840
I'd have a little bit of
phi_3, and a big bit of phi_4.

816
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,780
And the two parts
would add to one.

817
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,920
It would take the
right proportion.

818
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:47,080
It would be the proportion,
by however much this spike was

819
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:51,540
near there, it would give
that extra weight to phi_4.

820
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:54,870
OK.

821
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:57,570
So there is the
finite element method.

822
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:02,180
It produced something that you
might say, oh, we knew that.

823
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:08,340
But you've got to see that it
deals automatically with c(x),

824
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,220
it deals automatically
with f(x),

825
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,810
it deals automatically
with the free boundary.

826
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:18,715
You see, the solution
there is going

827
00:51:18,715 --> 00:51:22,600
to take sort of a balance,
a pretty close balance,

828
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:27,420
of this half hat with this one,
and the solution will actually

829
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,800
be a pretty close to free.

830
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,540
It'll be pretty close to having
the right zero slope there.

831
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,360
OK, good.
