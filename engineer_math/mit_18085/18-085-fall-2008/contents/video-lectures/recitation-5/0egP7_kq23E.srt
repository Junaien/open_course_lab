9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,940
PROFESSOR STRANG: So this is
review session number five,

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,530
I guess it is.

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,310
And it comes before
an exam next Tuesday,

12
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,110
and actually there'll be a
further review session number

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,250
six on Monday, right
before the exam.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:48,360
So maybe today we would,
there's a homework problem set

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,490
on Chapter 2, mostly
the oscillating masses

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:01,680
and springs and today's
lecture that you

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,870
see traces of, networks.

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,730
And masses and springs
also the static case.

19
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,840
So I'm open as
always to questions.

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,200
Yes please, thank you?

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,670
AUDIENCE: 2.2 number six.

22
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,080
PROFESSOR STRANG:
2.2, number six.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,731
OK.

24
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:25,230
Yeah.

25
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:32,270
So this is, and of course you
understand that, so I'm happy,

26
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,420
that's a good
question to discuss.

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,720
And maybe number
seven people well

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,000
have something to say about.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,100
Good.

30
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,310
So that just fine, so let
me start right in on those.

31
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,470
So, number six is
the fact, I mean

32
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,870
everybody understands that
when energy is conserved,

33
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,590
that's an important thing.

34
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,950
And so the question is first
when is energy conserved

35
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,400
in the differential equations?

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,980
In the equation we're
trying to solve?

37
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,540
And if it is, then
we want to know,

38
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,900
we would like to choose
difference methods that

39
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,710
also conserve energy.

40
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,060
They may not be exactly
right, they may not be exactly

41
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,760
at a right point on this circle,
if we're in that model problem,

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,710
but still on the circle.

43
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,850
So, and the point is that
the trapezoidal method does

44
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,350
stay on the circle, and
of course the differential

45
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,110
equation stays on the circle.

46
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:42,660
Can I, so, and I put quite
a bit into this problem six.

47
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:52,440
So this is 2.2.6, and and let
me try say something about that,

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,610
OK.

49
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,430
So, first of all, there's the
continuous problem. du/dt=Au.

50
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,810
When does that conserve energy?

51
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,780
And then there's the
discrete problem,

52
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,880
which we know that Euler's
doesn't conserve energy,

53
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,660
because we've seen it, the
computer shows you right away.

54
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,200
It spirals up from
the circle, it

55
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,140
spirals in, or forward
and backward, or whatever.

56
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,960
But trapezoidal method, is
that the one that turns out

57
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,010
to be well?

58
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,390
OK, so it refers to equation
24 as the trapezoidal method,

59
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,000
and let me try to
follow that notation.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:45,480
Yep. the trapezoidal
method is this one.

61
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,220
Did we get music there for
the trapezoidal method?

62
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,820
OK. u_(n+1) equal
(I+A*delta t/2)u_n.

63
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,760


64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,230
OK.

65
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,530
Right.

66
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,470
OK.

67
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,560
So that, and actually
problem seven,

68
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,110
that you maybe want
to discuss too,

69
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,060
is the question of how
accurate this is compared

70
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,600
to the differential equation.

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,370
Everybody should see that
this really came from,

72
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:28,100
the original way to look at
this was (u_(n+1)-u_n)/delta t,

73
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,440
that approximated
the derivative,

74
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,000
equals A and then I'm
taking half at u--

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,060
at the new time and
half at the old time.

76
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,520
So it's got that centering.

77
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,040
That we suspect will give
us a little extra accuracy.

78
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,370
OK.

79
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,770
So two questions then.

80
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,980
One was the stability,
so problem six

81
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:06,930
was the energy conserved,
and problem 2.2.7,

82
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:12,050
if I anticipate it, is
the order of accuracy.

83
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,290
So these are both
topics that are

84
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,960
extremely important in
choosing a difference method.

85
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,290
We would like to know first
when is energy conserved there?

86
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,570
What differential equations
have conserved energy?

87
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,160
Physically we kind of
can see them coming.

88
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,730
If a physical universe
is not being-- Somehow,

89
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,970
lots of physical problems, we
see those masses and springs

90
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,550
oscillating, and we
say OK, nothing's

91
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,270
coming in from outside,
how could-- Energy

92
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,950
there would be the sum of the
kinetic energy of the masses,

93
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,890
and the potential
energy in the springs.

94
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:04,040
So energy passes
between kinetic,

95
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,160
when the mass is zooming
past equilibrium,

96
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,260
and potential energy, when the
mass is stretching the spring.

97
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,030
So we've got two cases.

98
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,540
And we would hope, and
this trapezoidal method

99
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,280
comes through, that
energy is conserved.

100
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,390
So can I just begin
with this one?

101
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,010
Maybe I always ought to say,
because you guys are also

102
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:37,150
thinking about the quiz.

103
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,010
So, for example, this
question about how

104
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:45,870
to find the order of accuracy,
I'll speak about that.

105
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,460
but let me just say
that's not something

106
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,270
that we've done in enough
detail that I would

107
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,220
expect you to be
quick on the quiz

108
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,700
and just be able to do it out.

109
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,260
I'll try to choose
questions on the exam

110
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,180
that you really have
had more practice with.

111
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,700
But this is certainly important,
so it was that definitely right

112
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,060
to put on the homework.

113
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,630
And this is important.

114
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:20,930
OK, so let me tackle this one.

115
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,490
First the differential equation.

116
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,820
So by energy here I'm meaning
just the length of u squared.

117
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,700
So now I'm looking at
energy conserved, OK.

118
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,310
So I'm hoping energy
conserved would

119
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:44,220
mean that the derivative
of u squared was zero.

120
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,280
That's what conserving
energy would mean.

121
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,040
And my question is
which differential

122
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,490
equations-- What's the
condition on A, in other words?

123
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,400
How would I recognize
from this matrix A

124
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,390
that I have this
interesting property?

125
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,960
OK.

126
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,170
So, let me just show
you what I would do.

127
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:15,340
Another way to write u
squared is u transposed u.

128
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,950
These are vectors, of course.

129
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,270
So what's the derivative
of u transpose u?

130
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,960
My equation is telling me what
the derivative of u is here,

131
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,890
I've got the thing squared.

132
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,720
OK.

133
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,440
I have a product here, right?

134
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,760
I've u's times u's.

135
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,280
So I'm going to
use the standard--

136
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,200
They happen to be vectors, so
if I want to use like freshman

137
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,810
calculus, I'd have to
get down to the scalar

138
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,680
to get down to the
numbers, but I absolutely

139
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,070
could do that and just
follow them along, component

140
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,920
by component.

141
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,630
Or I could try to do it
a whole column at a time.

142
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,920
And let me try that.

143
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,730
It's going to be the
product rule, right?

144
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:12,130
In some form I'll have this guy
times the derivative of this

145
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,100
plus the derivative,
I'll keep them

146
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,370
in order, the derivative of
this thing, times this guy.

147
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,110
Right?

148
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,500
That's the product rule.

149
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,300
OK, now what do I know here?

150
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,410
I know that the
du/dt is Au, right?

151
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,820
So this is u transposed Au.

152
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:41,440
And I know du, is that
dt meant to be dt?

153
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,240
So du/dt is Au, again.

154
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:54,110
Look, this isn't difficult.
It's (Au) transpose u.

155
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:59,050
And the question is,
when is this zero, OK?

156
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,090
So those were the two terms
from the product rule,

157
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,500
and notice they're
not exactly the same.

158
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:11,640
This is u transpose Au,
and what's this guy?

159
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,710
u transpose A transpose u.

160
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,940
So if I put them
together, I have

161
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:24,660
u transpose times the A and
the A transpose times u.

162
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,910
And I'm hoping that this will
be zero, for all the solutions

163
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,500
that I've come up with.

164
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,470
So the condition is
simply that A plus A--

165
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,290
we want that to be the zero
matrix, A plus A transpose.

166
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,860
In other words, if A
transpose is minus A,

167
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,030
that's the good one.

168
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,920
If A transpose is
minus A, this is

169
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,580
zero, that's zero,
that's zero, that's

170
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,460
zero, energy's conserved.

171
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,340
So the energy is conserved
when A transpose is minus

172
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:08,070
A. It's for the anti-symmetric
A's that energy is conserved.

173
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,340
And of course this
all makes sense.

174
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:17,140
What are the special solutions
to that differential equation?

175
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,800
The special solutions to this
equation are e to the, just,

176
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,120
this is connecting now with
things that really are basic.

177
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,270
The special solutions,
the pure eigensolutions,

178
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,840
the ones that follow
their own paths,

179
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,310
are the e^(lambda*t)x's, right?

180
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:46,300
Where x is an eigenvector of
A, and lambda's an eigenvalue.

181
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,190
Those are the guys, and we
expect to have n of them,

182
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,340
and we expect a
combination of those

183
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,920
to give us the general solution
and to match the boundary

184
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,500
conditions.

185
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,055
So these are the,
these n of these guys

186
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:01,180
with n different eigenvectors
and their eigenvalues

187
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:08,370
are the heart of
problems like this.

188
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,430
And of course that's the
additional homework problem

189
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:19,530
that wasn't in the book but I
added as an additional problem

190
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,120
was exactly that, to
get you to practice

191
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,280
with these eigenvectors
and eigenvalues.

192
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,590
OK, now, what's the
deal, I want to connect

193
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:32,860
this energy conserving with
this picture of solutions.

194
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,080
When would this keep
the same energy?

195
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:46,110
When would this have constant
energy, constant length?

196
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,130
The length would be constant,
since x is certainly,

197
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,770
that's an eigenvector,
whatever it is.

198
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,670
This is what's changing.

199
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,260
And now I want to know, when
does the length not change?

200
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,630
Well, the test would be
that this number should

201
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,570
have absolute value one, right?

202
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,030
If this keeps absolute
value one, then

203
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:16,710
in the eigenvalue picture I
have energy staying the same.

204
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,420
OK?

205
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,130
Now, when will this
have magnitude one?

206
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,700
Time is running along, this
is e to the lambda t, so which

207
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,680
lambdas?

208
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,850
Zero, certainly, but
now there's more,

209
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,660
you gotta know the others.

210
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,210
What other lambdas
will have, what

211
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,990
other lambdas give me this
thing stays on the unit

212
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,360
circle, absolute value one?

213
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,800
Key question you must
know. lambda could be?

214
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,550
Imaginary. lambda
could be imaginary;

215
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,767
right, lambda
could be imaginary.

216
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:54,350
e^(i*omega*t).

217
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,150


218
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,110
That's just like basic
fact about complex numbers,

219
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,000
that if lambda's imaginary we
would have cosine of something

220
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,980
t plus i times the
sine of something t,

221
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,350
cos squared plus sine
squared being one,

222
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,920
we'd be on the unit circle.

223
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,020
So from this picture we
would want the lambdas

224
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,920
to be pure imaginary.

225
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,640
And now a little
next step, what we'd

226
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:32,320
like for eigenvectors, because
the real solution will not

227
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,180
be just one of these
guys but a combination.

228
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,620
So when we have a combination
each one is doing its thing,

229
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,540
each one better have
lambda imaginary

230
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:50,770
but more than that, we
would want the x's to be

231
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,650
perpendicular.

232
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:57,890
Because if the x's interact,
then this guy, one of these,

233
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,610
you will say there's
only one there,

234
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,330
but I'm thinking
of n of them there.

235
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,930
A combination of
say, two of them.

236
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,970
Suppose I have an
e^(lambda_1 t)*x_1,

237
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:13,520
and an e^(lambda_2*t)*x_2,
when does that conserve energy?

238
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:20,650
Well, each one will, but
the combination will be fine

239
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,570
if the x's are perpendicular.

240
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,920
Because if I have
perpendicular vectors,

241
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,080
then the length of the whole
combination by Pythagoras

242
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,960
is just one squared
and the other squared

243
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,430
and each of those
pieces is constant.

244
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,910
Let me say what
I'm trying to say.

245
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,270
That the eigenvalue,
eigenfunction picture

246
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:45,290
also tells us that we would
like imaginary eigenvalues

247
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,070
and perpendicular eigenvectors.

248
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:53,010
And that is exactly what you get
from A transpose equal minus A.

249
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,630
So A transpose equal
minus A is exactly,

250
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,130
those matrices,
anti-symmetric matrices,

251
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:06,050
have perpendicular eigenvectors,
just like symmetric,

252
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,290
but the eigenvalues
are pure imaginary.

253
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,910
Instead of all being real,
they're all pure imaginary.

254
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,820
In other words, that
answer and the discussion

255
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,840
here came to the
same conclusion,

256
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,290
that A should be anti-symmetric.

257
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,560
OK.

258
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,460
Now let me look at--
Is that OK, so that's

259
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,340
a discussion which
is worth knowing

260
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,960
about differential equations.

261
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,610
When is energy conserved.

262
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,250
Now I want to do,
or the problem asks

263
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,950
me to do, what about
this difference equation?

264
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,290
When is energy conserved there?

265
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:50,690
And I believe it
will be, this is

266
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,830
the requirement for the
differential equation

267
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,340
to be OK, to conserve energy
and so I'm going to expect,

268
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,780
I'm going to need
that in this one.

269
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,340
And is that enough?

270
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,070
If I have this A transpose
equal minus A, anti-symmetric,

271
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:10,460
it was good for this, does
it also do the job here?

272
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,240
Is this trapezoidal
method just cool

273
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,140
so that it will
conserve energy, too.

274
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,920
And the answer, I think,
is yes, and the problem

275
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,850
was to prove it, or to see why.

276
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,230
So what do I now want?

277
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,910
If you don't mind
my erasing, I'm

278
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:35,190
now going to look
at the discrete guy.

279
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:40,390
So now I'm looking at when
is u_(n+1) squared equal u_n

280
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,450
squared?

281
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,620
That's what I mean by conserving
energy in the discrete case.

282
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,290
At every step, same energy.

283
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,780
So now I want to look at the
energy in u_(n+1) compared

284
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:59,590
to the energy in u_n, and I
want to see that this holds.

285
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:08,240
Probably, there's some
smart way to do that.

286
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,200
Now we're down to just
the math questions.

287
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,650
Math is always looking for
some, you just sort of do

288
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,530
the right thing, you stand
back and poof it works.

289
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,110
OK, so what's the right thing?

290
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,860
Hopefully I have
helped you and me

291
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,480
by saying what would be
a good idea to do here.

292
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,160
Can I just look?

293
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,660
OK, it say, oh, does
it say what to do?

294
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,190
Yeah.

295
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,640
It says multiply by u_(n+1)+u_n.

296
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,480


297
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,010
Take the dot product,
that's interesting.

298
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,920
Take the dot product,
so why did that work?

299
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,480
Take the dot product of
both sides with u_(n+1)-u_n.

300
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,630


301
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,060
Did anybody succeed
with this idea?

302
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,700
But that's the idea.

303
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,550
And hopefully we'll
get it to work.

304
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:16,890
That if I multiply both sides
by u_(n+1), oh, no, plus u_n.

305
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,260
Maybe better if I
look at it this way.

306
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,690
I'm sort of OK to
do it that way.

307
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,440
Suppose I multiply both sides.

308
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,240
So now I'm following on
this idea, That equation

309
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,660
I've rewritten here and without
practice I don't know which one

310
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,780
is the good one to start with.

311
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,240
But I'm pretty OK with
starting with this one.

312
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,300
So what's my idea?

313
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,010
That's my equation, now I'm
going to multiply both sides

314
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,900
by (u_(n+1)+u_n) transpose.

315
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,400
Now I don't have room
to do it, unfortunately.

316
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,110
I want to stick in here
u_(n+...) with a plus sign

317
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,170
in there, and of course I have
to do the same thing here.

318
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,440
OK.

319
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,000
Are you OK, do you
see what I'm doing?

320
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,400
I want to show that
this equation, which

321
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,510
is the same as this equation,
has this property which

322
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,320
is a copy of this property.

323
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,550
Here would be
another way to do it.

324
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,420
We could do it,
the way we're going

325
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,240
to do it now sort of compares
with the way we started

326
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,780
with the derivative
of the norm squared.

327
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,810
I could also ask
the same question

328
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,960
by following eigenvectors.

329
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,560
I could also ask
the same question

330
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,900
by following eigenvectors.

331
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:51,110
I'm guessing that here the
eigenvalues-- u_(n+1) is,

332
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,570
you see I could do it both ways.

333
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,870
Maybe having just
done eigenvectors

334
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,680
let me do this one
by eigenvectors.

335
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:04,010
So an eigenvector of
A, when it's x itself,

336
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,320
is, what happens
to an eigenvector.

337
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,280
Suppose u_0 is an eigenvector
x of A, What's u_1?

338
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,570
Yeah, you really should
see this question.

339
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:26,580
So u_0 is the eigenvector
x, then what is u_1?

340
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,730
Let me just write it here.

341
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,530
Ax equaling lambda*x.

342
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,720
So these are the
eigenvalues of A,

343
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,680
and we've learned that they're
pure imaginary in this case

344
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,920
when we're ready
to go, and now I'd

345
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,240
like to know that we
get the good thing here.

346
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:55,380
OK, so if u_n is an
eigenvector, what is u_(n+1)?

347
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,520
OK, so can I just
do that? u_(n+1) is,

348
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:10,990
so what do I have on that right
hand side? x and what is Ax?

349
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,590
It's lambda, right?

350
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,130
It's lambda*x.

351
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:22,860
So all this is one plus
lambda delta t on two x

352
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,560
but now I've also
got to bring this guy

353
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,720
over here, its inverse.

354
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,810
And see what that does.

355
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,410
Now it's the inverse,
so it's going

356
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:40,330
to have the same eigenvector
and the eigenvalue's

357
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,290
going to go in the
denominator and it'll

358
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:50,090
be one minus lambda
delta t over two.

359
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,280
OK, so that's u_(n+1).

360
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,840
Do you see what's
happening here?

361
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:02,020
The eigenvector x, if we
start with that eigenvector x,

362
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,190
we come out with
a multiple of x.

363
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,800
And this is the multiple.

364
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,810
So each finite difference
step multiplies by a number

365
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:15,440
just the way each, in
the continuous case

366
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,940
we were multiplying
by e to the lambda t

367
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,760
and in the discrete
step by step case

368
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,270
we're multiplying
by that number.

369
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,670
Actually, this is why
problem seven is important,

370
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:33,980
because if we want to know how
accurate the comparison is I

371
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:39,800
want to compare e to the
lambda t with that number.

372
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:47,150
So problem six is asking a
question about that ratio.

373
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,790
And problem seven is
asking another question

374
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,770
about that very same ratio.

375
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,430
Now what's the question
for problem six?

376
00:23:54,430 --> 00:24:01,630
When will this vector have
the same length as-- This

377
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:08,180
x was u_n.

378
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:14,330
So I started with the u_n,
I multiplied by this number

379
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:19,750
to get u_(n+1), when do
they have the same length?

380
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:27,210
When that number has
absolute value one.

381
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,680
So if I'm watching
eigenvectors, this guy

382
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,550
had absolute value one
because lambda was imaginary.

383
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,570
Now, what about
this guy? lambda's

384
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,110
still that same
lambda, imaginary.

385
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,130
What can you tell
me about one plus,

386
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:48,850
so lambda is some i*omega, delta
t over two and down here I have

387
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:54,200
one minus i*omega, that's
the lambda, delta t over two.

388
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:00,460
I believe that that does
have absolute value one.

389
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,620
Anybody tell me why?

390
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:07,980
So this is checking
that energy is

391
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,580
conserved for each eigenvector.

392
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,090
The energy-- Because the
eigenvector is multiplied

393
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,290
by that number and
that's some number,

394
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,810
it's some complex
number, but I believe

395
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,080
it has absolute value one and
I believe you can tell me why.

396
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,740
Yep.

397
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,450
Because they're
complex conjugates.

398
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,480
This numerator and the
denominator are complex

399
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:38,260
conjugates, in the complex
plane here's the one,

400
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:43,380
and I go up by
i*omega*delta t over two,

401
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,780
or on this one I go down by--
Bu those lengths are the same.

402
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,110
That numerator, the
length of the numerator

403
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,740
is that guy, the length of
the denominator is this guy,

404
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,450
and their ratio is one.

405
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,970
So I think that this
gives us the point

406
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,310
about complex numbers.

407
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:09,010
That a complex number
and its conjugate

408
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:14,270
automatically have
ratio of magnitude one.

409
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,550
You see the difference
between Euler's method.

410
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:24,450
So Euler's method, so
forward Euler-- Forward Euler

411
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:31,560
would not have had this
stuff on the left side.

412
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,790
It would all have been
on the right-hand side.

413
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:38,790
Forward Euler would have
been about i plus A*delta t.

414
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,670
Delta t A. And what
are its eigenvalues?

415
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:48,410
One plus i omega delta t, right?

416
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:54,600
With no, we're not
dividing by anybody.

417
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,030
This part is up top too, so
it's one plus i*omega*delta t.

418
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,990
Now, does that have
absolute value one?

419
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,480
Well, you know from the way
I'm asking the question, what

420
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,280
can you tell me about
the absolute value

421
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,310
of the forward
Euler growth factor?

422
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,400
Greater than one.

423
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,310
Because this is the one, and
this is the i*omega*delta t,

424
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,550
maybe went up twice as far.

425
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,980
And there was
nobody to divide by.

426
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,290
It's bigger than
one, so it blows up.

427
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:29,850
And the backward Euler had
only the one over one minus

428
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:37,050
i*omega*delta t, so the backward
was like this, one over it.

429
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:37,980
And less than one.

430
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,960
But this balance has
absolute value equal one.

431
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:47,230
So, OK, that's the sort of
heart of what's going on.

432
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:54,270
Can I, before I tackle the
question using the hint there,

433
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:57,180
which would take me
on another blackboard,

434
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,180
can I discuss question seven?

435
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,570
Were you going to ask
me about number seven?

436
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:02,750
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was.

437
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,000
PROFESSOR STRANG: You were?

438
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,820
OK.

439
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,670
Alright.

440
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,840
We get the answer.

441
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,280
So, question seven is
about the accuracy.

442
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:18,350
So here's the correct number,
this is my e^(i*omega*t),

443
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:24,000
that's the correct number that
I should be multiplying by.

444
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,080
And the actual number that I'm
multiplying by is that much.

445
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,680
Or, in the forward Euler
case, it's that one.

446
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:40,000
And so I'm comparing
the one step accuracy.

447
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,580
So let me compare
one step accuracy.

448
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:49,100
So this is the topic now,
of order of accuracy.

449
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,140
This is question seven.

450
00:28:52,140 --> 00:29:01,520
And it amounts to comparing
the-- So what is one delta t

451
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,820
step in the continuous case?

452
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,600
So how much does
the eigenvector x,

453
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,330
what does it get multiplied
by if I take a delta t

454
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,530
step in the
differential equation?

455
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,660
So this is the
exact delta t step,

456
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,740
what the finite difference
won't get exactly right.

457
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:26,740
So the exact step delta t.

458
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:36,660
The differential equation, and
of course I'm always looking

459
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:46,690
at Ax=lambda*x, the differential
equation multiplies x by what?

460
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:52,910
What's the exact growth
factor, you could say,

461
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:57,620
if my equation is du/dt=Au,
that's the differential

462
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:03,810
equation, and I'm supposing
that I'm on an eigenvector x,

463
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:09,630
so that the solution
is e^(i*omega*t),

464
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,440
or e^(i*lambda*x).

465
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:19,010
Now, what happened
over a delta t step?

466
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:23,340
This is the answer like
running along for all time,

467
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,380
all I'm asking you to
do is if the step is

468
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,220
delta t, what's that number?

469
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,310
I mean that number is telling us
how much it grew in that delta

470
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,380
t step, and of course
it's e^(i*omega*delta t).

471
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,420


472
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,770
That's the exact growth
factor, that's G_exact.

473
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,350


474
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,760
In one time step,
the eigenvector

475
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,310
gets multiplied by that, because
that's the amount of time that

476
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,330
elapsed.

477
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,610
And what's the
approximate growth,

478
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:03,900
the growth factor
from trapezoidal

479
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,110
is just what we wrote down here.

480
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:14,510
One plus lambda*delta t, maybe
I'll stay with lambda rather

481
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,110
than i*omega.

482
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:19,320


483
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,010
e^(lambda*delta t), and this
was one plus delta t over two

484
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:33,320
lambda, divided by one minus
delta t over two lambda.

485
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:42,560
So question seven just says
compare that with that.

486
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,380
Thinking of delta t as a small
time step, if delta t is zero,

487
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,200
then of course e
to the zero is one,

488
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,270
if delta t is zero
I get one here,

489
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:59,180
they're correct if delta t
is zero, that's no big deal.

490
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:09,240
How do I understand what
happens for small delta t?

491
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,690
I'm comparing this exponential
for a small delta t

492
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,980
with this guy for
a small delta t.

493
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,230
How do you make comparisons
for a small delta t?

494
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,730
Well, that's what Taylor
series is all about.

495
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,150
Let's do the Taylor series.

496
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,870
What's the series
for the exponential?

497
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:32,790
If delta t is small, I have
e to some little number,

498
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:40,220
tell me, start me out
on the exponential.

499
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:49,010
One, thanks, one plus,
lambda*delta t plus,

500
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,700
this is the exponential series,
there are only two series

501
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,100
in this world that
are worth knowing.

502
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,840
Really, that's literally true.

503
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,600
In calculus you study all
these infinite series,

504
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,400
there are two that
are important,

505
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,150
that are worth remembering
long after calculus.

506
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:09,600
And e to the x, e to the
whatever, is one of them.

507
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,070
OK, what's the next term?

508
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:17,980
Over two, lambda delta
t squared over two,

509
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,880
and then there's a cube guy
if you don't mind telling me

510
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,180
what's the denominator
in that one?

511
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,750
It's three factorial six.

512
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,250
Good.

513
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,040
And onward.

514
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,570
OK.

515
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,570
So that's one of the series
that everybody should know.

516
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:37,540
OK, how we going to
deal with this guy?

517
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,930
We want to expand that,
so what's my goal?

518
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:45,200
I want you to expand that
in powers of lambda*delta t

519
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,960
and compare with this.

520
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,980
And see where, they aren't
going to be equal, right?

521
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,800
At some point they're
going to be different.

522
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,160
But at least they
should start out equal.

523
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:03,550
So so here's the heart
of problem seven.

524
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:08,400
How do I expand this
in powers of delta t?

525
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,030
Do you mind if I
just, this is just

526
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:17,650
a number let me put it times
one over, so this is times one

527
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:23,410
minus delta t over two
lambda, inverse right?

528
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,930
I just bring that
up as a number.

529
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:32,770
So it's this guy times
one over this guy.

530
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,330
What do I do?

531
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:46,480
This is, here's the moment
when the math tools get used.

532
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,040
And I'm well aware
that it's like years

533
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,480
since you did calculus
or series or whatever,

534
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,170
and those tools get rusty.

535
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:02,510
And the point is that
they're really genuine tools

536
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,060
that we can now use.

537
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,250
So what do you think?

538
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,500
This is the problem one,
this is the one coming from

539
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,770
the denominator;
this is 1/(1-x).

540
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,560
So I have a 1/(1-x) deal.

541
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,750
And what's the series for that?

542
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,870
I said there were two
series worth remembering,

543
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,650
and sure enough the
exponential was one of them

544
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:32,060
and now we're ready
for the other one.

545
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,990
What's the series for that guy?

546
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,530
1+x, good start.

547
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:45,370
Plus x squared.

548
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:49,820
Right, x squared plus
x cubed and so on.

549
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,530
Real simple.

550
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,610
It's all the same stuff
with no factorials.

551
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,360
Those are the two
series to know.

552
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,320
The exponential series
and the geometric series.

553
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,710
Right, that's the
geometric series.

554
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:07,020
OK, so that's what I've
got out of this stuff.

555
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,030
Can I write it below?

556
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,490
I have one plus delta
t over two lambda.

557
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,270
Let me just call that
x for the moment.

558
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,920
Delta t over two lambda is my x.

559
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,190
One plus x, and this is 1/(1-x),
which you just told me is one

560
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:29,730
plus x plus x squared
plus x cubed and so on.

561
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,370
And now I've got to do
that multiplication.

562
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:40,020
OK, x is, remember this is
x, I'm just saving space.

563
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,580
Can you multiply those guys?

564
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,650
So that's one plus x
times a lot of stuff here.

565
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,150
What do I have all together?

566
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,210
Well, the one,
what's the next term?

567
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,270
Two x's?

568
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,430
Everybody spots
the two x's there?

569
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:03,040
And then the next term, you
have to get these terms right

570
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,380
because we plan to
compare with this guy

571
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,710
and see how many we get.

572
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,650
How many x squareds
are in there?

573
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,100
Is it two?

574
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,110
Looks like two.

575
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,810
Two x squareds.

576
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,370
And two x cubes, and so on.

577
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,710
Yeah, that looks right, OK.

578
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:22,670
Now I'm ready, what
am I ready for?

579
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:28,230
I'm ready to say what x is, x
is this delta t over two lambda.

580
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,850
So what have I got here, one?

581
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,190
What is this guy now?

582
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:37,540
Two x's is delta t lambda.

583
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,180
Is this good?

584
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,280
Yes, right?

585
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,420
We're pleased.

586
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,880
Because the two x
is the, two of these

587
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,250
is delta t lambda and that's
what we wanted to match.

588
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,090
Absolutely.

589
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,520
Delta t lambda, lambda delta t.

590
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,400
Now let's keep going.

591
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,860
By the way if this first
term hadn't matched

592
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,770
we would be extremely surprised.

593
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,730
Because that first
matching is only

594
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,760
saying that my difference
equation is quite consistent,

595
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,610
it's a reasonable creation out
of the differential equation.

596
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,230
And we knew that.

597
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,490
The question is how much
further are we going to get?

598
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,900
Euler will not get any further.

599
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,550
With Euler the next
ones will fail.

600
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,240
But I think with trapezoidal
the next ones are going to work.

601
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,750
Does it work?

602
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:35,170
It's like we're holding
our breath, right?

603
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,380
Two now, I'm going
to put in x squared

604
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,490
and see about this
term. x is what?

605
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:45,640
x is this guy, delta
t over two lambda.

606
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,230
Delta t lambda
over two, squared.

607
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,490
And now you get the fun.

608
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,930
Because you're going to
compare this term with what?

609
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,530
With this term.

610
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:03,190
And are they the same?

611
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,010
Yes.

612
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,100
Yes.

613
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,790
So that's the way,
you see, that you

614
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:12,380
got the extra accuracy which
Euler did not give you,

615
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,820
but that's why the
trapezoidal rule is

616
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,970
a is a second order
accurate method.

617
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:29,270
OK, you may say that I went
overboard to say all that.

618
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,690
You may say I didn't
ask that question.

619
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:36,120
But it's the right question to
ask about order of accuracy,

620
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,740
and it's what problem seven
was intending to bring.

621
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:50,140
Maybe I called it h in problem
seven rather than x here.

622
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,260
Well.

623
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,660
Oh gosh, I realize
I I'm supposed

624
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,510
to come back to this one.

625
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,880
But some people might
have other problems

626
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,330
that they're interested in.

627
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:06,340
But let me, because
time is pushing along,

628
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,260
and the solution to
this one we'll post,

629
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,220
let me at least offer
the possibility to ask me

630
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,830
about something completely,
not six or seven here,

631
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,860
but something
entirely different,

632
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,920
like what's the first question
on the quiz or anything.

633
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:32,510
And that, let me say I'll
hope to know by Tuesday.

634
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:37,260
I love to teach, but making
up exams is serious work.

635
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,430
Anyway.

636
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:46,100
Let me open a board and open to
another question of any sort.

637
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:50,540
Any place, Chapter 1,
Chapter 2, whatever.

638
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,870
Is there anything?

639
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:56,610
So I know that you're in
the middle of this homework.

640
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:03,220
So I can say a little
more here about

641
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,720
that number six if you want,
but I wanted to allow, yep.

642
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:14,580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

643
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,240
PROFESSOR STRANG: The
A, from today's lecture

644
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,280
this was the incidence
matrix, and this

645
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,630
was the A transpose A
that's probably still

646
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,201
on the board somewhere.

647
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:28,700
Yep.

648
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,030
Yep.

649
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:36,980
So this is the A, which
you should take in and be

650
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,610
able to create if I
gave you the graph,

651
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,730
and this is the A
transpose A, so it's

652
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:44,020
through today's lecture, yeah.

653
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,200
Next lecture I'll be talking
about the A transpose

654
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,430
by itself, which involves
Kirchhoff's current law,

655
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,090
it's beautiful.

656
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,210
A transpose w equals zero.

657
00:41:55,210 --> 00:42:00,550
But I think this part was
straightforward enough

658
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:06,410
to be able to add this
to our list of problems

659
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,720
which fit the framework.

660
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,790
So that's what that was about.

661
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:15,260
It doesn't mean that this will
be on but it could be, right.

662
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,380
OK, what else?

663
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,844
You guys are patient, I
come on-- Yeah, thanks.

664
00:42:20,844 --> 00:42:21,760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

665
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,676
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yep.

666
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:25,370
AUDIENCE: This is only valid
when x is less than one?

667
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:29,740
PROFESSOR STRANG: It's only
valid when x is less than one,

668
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:34,880
so that's now the math point
that this expansion for e^x

669
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,070
valid for all x's.

670
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:40,200
Because you're dividing by
these bigger and bigger numbers.

671
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,150
But this one is only
valid up to x=1.

672
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,450
At x=1 we're getting
one plus one plus one,

673
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,520
and we're getting one
over one minus one,

674
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,030
sort of infinity
matches infinity,

675
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:58,780
but then if x goes up to two,
yeah what happens if x is two?

676
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,090
It's sort of not good,
but you know mathematics,

677
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:05,010
it's never completely
crazy, right?

678
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,960
If x is two, what does this say?

679
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,450
What have I got on
the left hand side?

680
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,640
Negative one.

681
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,560
And what have I got on
the right hand side?

682
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:21,010
One plus two plus
four plus eight.

683
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:24,270
I should not allow
this to be videotaped,

684
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:30,410
but that's actually not
so completely crazy.

685
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:37,700
In some nutty way that
could still make some sense.

686
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,110
That's certainly will not be
on the-- So you're right that x

687
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:45,520
should be less than one, and
of course it will be here

688
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,550
because I'm looking
at little delta t's.

689
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:53,380
Little, so my delta t-- My x
was this thing and my delta t,

690
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,970
the time step was small
and somehow that tells me,

691
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,350
actually this is
a good indication.

692
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,090
It gives me the units.

693
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:06,510
That stability and
things going right

694
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:09,710
will depend on lambda delta t.

695
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:14,540
Will depend on lambda delta t,
that's the key parameter there.

696
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,640
That's like the
dimensionless parameter

697
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,520
that we're, or lambda delta
t over two, or whatever.

698
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,310
But lambda delta t is the key.

699
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,860
And a highly important key.

700
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,040
It tells us that as
lambda gets bigger,

701
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,820
as the matrix has
bigger eigenvalues,

702
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,670
delta t has got to get smaller.

703
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,740
And I mentioned stiff equations.

704
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:43,000
Stiff equations are equations
where the eigenvalues lambda

705
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,450
are out of scale.

706
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,380
You know, you might have two
eigenvalues, one of size one

707
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,940
and the other of size
ten to the fourth,

708
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,330
because you've got two
physical processes going on

709
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:57,480
at the same time.

710
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,350
And those equations are
tough, because that ten

711
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:04,060
to the fourth guy is
forcing your delta t

712
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,320
to be really small.

713
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,740
Whereas the action
might, the true,

714
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,940
real solution might be
controlled by the lambda=1 guy.

715
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,620
So to follow this
slow evolution,

716
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:19,100
you're having to take very small
steps because on top of that

717
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,060
slow evolution
with the lambda=1,

718
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,590
there's some very fast evolution
maybe with lambda equal minus

719
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,140
10,000.

720
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:32,630
Yeah, there's a
lot happening here.

721
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,450
And always you have
to think OK, is there

722
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,970
some way around that box.

723
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:44,510
Because forward Euler
would not get you through.

724
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,611
OK, thanks for that question,
you got another one?

725
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:47,110
OK.

726
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:50,135
AUDIENCE: So then if you
weren't using small enough time

727
00:45:50,135 --> 00:45:51,420
steps, [INAUDIBLE]?

728
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:55,390
PROFESSOR STRANG: If you weren't
using small enough time steps,

729
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:56,790
OK.

730
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,120
For trapezoidal, let's say?

731
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,384
AUDIENCE: I mean, that
expansion wouldn't hold

732
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,550
if you were using a lambda--

733
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,508
PROFESSOR STRANG: Well,
the expansion is really

734
00:46:04,508 --> 00:46:05,920
intended for a small delta t.

735
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,420
Yeah.

736
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,730
It's not intended, I never
added up the whole series.

737
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:14,770
I just compared a couple of
terms to see how am I doing,

738
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:19,260
and I got the extra term
to match from trapezoidal

739
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,760
that I didn't get from Euler.

740
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,600
So what's to say?

741
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,060
If you took delta
t too big, what

742
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:31,050
would happen in the
trapezoidal method?

743
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,440
Well, you would
stay on this circle

744
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,410
because the absolute value
of this thing is truly one.

745
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:43,120
Even if lambda is enormous
and delta t is way too big,

746
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:49,320
we still had complex conjugates
and their ratio was one.

747
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,420
So we would not
leave the circle,

748
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,900
at least in perfect
arithmetic, as everybody says.

749
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,820
If we didn't make
any round-off error,

750
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,570
we would not leave the circle.

751
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:02,020
But boy would we skip all
over the place on that circle.

752
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,080
So if we took
delta t too big, we

753
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,730
would be completely inaccurate.

754
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:10,270
We wouldn't be unstable,
for trapezoidal,

755
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,910
because it would
stay on the circle,

756
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:16,090
but the phase would be
completely wrong, yeah.

757
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:19,120
So it would be a complex
number of absolute value one,

758
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:28,310
but it would not be close
to the exact growth factor.

759
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,880
Well, so many things to say.

760
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,720
I realize that the course
moves along pretty quickly

761
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,070
but this topic of numerical
methods for differential

762
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:44,460
equations, that's a
core part of 18.086.

763
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:51,550
So I'm like anticipating here
in just a couple of days what

764
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:55,730
really takes longer is the
stability and the accuracy

765
00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:05,330
and the best choices for
time-dependent problems.

766
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,640
OK, always good questions.

767
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,010
Anything else that's on
your mind of any sort?

768
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:10,730
Yes, thanks.

769
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:11,690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

770
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:17,940
PROFESSOR STRANG: 114?

771
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,910
AUDIENCE: There is a figure 2.7.

772
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:21,785
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK.

773
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:22,285
OK.

774
00:48:22,285 --> 00:48:24,540
114 figure 2.7.

775
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,460
Oh yes, OK.

776
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,560
Oh yes.

777
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,260
AUDIENCE: I figure it's about
how these shapes [INAUDIBLE].

778
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,220
see.

779
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:37,320
That has a bunch of
figures, so that in order

780
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,880
to say for everybody who's
not looking at the book,

781
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,280
those figures are about the
problem we've discussed here

782
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,480
with a model problem,
where we're on a circle.

783
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,480
So do I have space
to draw a circle?

784
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,690
Well, let me just
make space here.

785
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,610
OK, so page 114 has
that model problem

786
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:03,430
that we've drawn before.

787
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:07,600
There's the exact solution,
here's the phase plane;

788
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,640
there's u and there's
u', and the u was cos(t),

789
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,830
so the u' was minus sin(t), and
we travel around the circle.

790
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,140
On the exact solution.

791
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,440
Energy constant, u squared
stays one-- u squared

792
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,460
plus u prime squared stay one.

793
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:30,361
Now which figure was it
you wanted me to look at?

794
00:49:30,361 --> 00:49:30,860
So.

795
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,476
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

796
00:49:32,476 --> 00:49:33,850
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Of any of them?

797
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

798
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:38,230
PROFESSOR STRANG:
OK, that's fine.

799
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:39,260
Let's see.

800
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,720
Is trapezoidal on that one?

801
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,220
Yeah.

802
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,460
Trapezoidal was the first one.

803
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,650
OK, so figure 2.6 shows
the trapezoidal method

804
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:50,290
moving around the circle.

805
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,100
So what happens?

806
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:55,160
Yeah, thanks, that's a
very suitable question.

807
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:02,340
OK. and I took, in that figure
I took, how long does it

808
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,650
take for the exact solution
to get exactly back

809
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,590
where it started?

810
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,720
At t equal what do I come back?

811
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,070
AUDIENCE: 2pi.

812
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,550
PROFESSOR STRANG:
t equal to 2pi,

813
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,960
I'm right back where I was.

814
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,460
Right?

815
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,870
Cosine has period 2pi.

816
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:24,550
OK, now a single
step of size 2pi

817
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:28,250
would be really
ridiculous, right?

818
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,050
I mean, I want to now delta t.

819
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:37,930
So in that figure I took delta
t to be 2pi divided by 32.

820
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:42,750
So I'm taking delta
t to be the 2pi, that

821
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:48,390
would bring me all the way
around, but I'm dividing by 32.

822
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:49,390
So, what does that mean?

823
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:54,420
What what does the exact
solution do at those steps?

824
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,120
32 steps?

825
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:01,360
It goes on the circle,
32 equal steps, 30, 360,

826
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,290
2pi divided by 32 radians
every time, comes back exactly

827
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,350
there, the exact solution.

828
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:12,210
And right where I started.

829
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:16,280
So it's like following a planet.

830
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,250
Now I do it by
finite differences.

831
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,410
So now I'm going to follow
the trapezoidal rule,

832
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:26,280
just what we've been talking
about, with that time step,

833
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,060
and with the equation--
Everybody remembers

834
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:34,040
the equation was [u, u'] equals,
do you remember what the matrix

835
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,950
was in that equation?

836
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,950
This is the derivative of
it and this is [u, u'].

837
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:45,780
Sorry to squeeze this in,
but what I'm, u' is u'.

838
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,000
u'' is minus u.

839
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,500
Now we know why that
matrix was good, right?

840
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,250
Why is that?

841
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:59,130
That's my matrix
A, why is it good?

842
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:02,440
Because it's exactly, it fits.

843
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,750
A transpose is minus
A. It's anti-symmetric.

844
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,670
Keeps me right on the circle.

845
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,740
OK now, trapezoidal
method keeps me

846
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,620
right on the circle, 32 steps.

847
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:20,170
And so the picture just shows
where it goes after 32 steps.

848
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:25,930
And 32, 32 does it
come back there?

849
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:28,070
Well, not exactly, right?

850
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:31,420
We don't expect to find
a different solution

851
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:37,180
to be exactly in sync
with cos(t), the real one.

852
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,460
But it's really close.

853
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:43,070
I think in that figure
I can see that that's

854
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:46,750
sort of a double
point there, at 2pi.

855
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:50,370
I put a little arrow
indicating small phase error.

856
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:55,350
It misses by a little bit.

857
00:52:55,350 --> 00:53:01,210
And actually, roughly
what does it miss by?

858
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:05,560
This was the point of the
order of accuracy stuff.

859
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,630
Roughly what size is
that little error?

860
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:12,400
That's what we did over here.

861
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:18,290
The term that we got
wrong was a delta t cubed.

862
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:21,000
At each step.

863
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,050
Can I just tell you the answer?

864
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:27,390
The error here is of
size delta t squared.

865
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,720
Because over here we
match those series

866
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:33,250
and we found the error
was delta t cubed.

867
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,540
That's in a single step.

868
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,740
But now we've got one
over delta t steps,

869
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,580
you see what I'm saying?

870
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:45,970
That if the error was
delta t cubed per step,

871
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:51,090
and I have one over delta
t steps, to get somewhere,

872
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:55,861
or 2pi over delta t or whatever,
then that gives me delta t

873
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:56,360
squared.

874
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:02,240
So that little error there is my
error of size delta t squared.

875
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,500
And that square tells me
I've got a good method.

876
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,510
At least, decent.

877
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,310
Second order accurate.

878
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:16,330
And the trapezoidal rule
is sort of the natural one.

879
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:20,390
Well, OK, so that's a
full hour mostly devoted

880
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,800
to two or three things.

881
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,720
Actually the eigenvectors
came into it.

882
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,980
And the energy
conservation came into it,

883
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:34,050
the stability matching
series came into it.

884
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:36,930
And the picture.

885
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:43,530
OK, I'll see you Friday
for more about these guys,

886
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:48,660
and then Monday evening
please ask me everything

887
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,190
you want to, on Monday evening.

888
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,940
OK.

889
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,400
Thank you.
