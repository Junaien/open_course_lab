00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,100
PROFESSOR STRANG: Ready for
the least squares lecture,

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,360
lecture 11?

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,840
Homework is just being
posted on the web.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,370
It'll be due, it's really
to help you practice, get

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,880
some experience on these
sections for the first exam.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,950
That's Tuesday evening.

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,140
So eight days away.

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,750
So the homework will
be due the day after.

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:58,270
And actually, we'll try to move
the review session to Monday

18
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,240
next week so you can ask me any
questions about the homework

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,840
or any review material.

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,630
So that's all a week
away and this week we

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,710
get two great examples.

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,280
Least squares is one
that comes today.

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,026
But could I first, because
I keep learning more--

24
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:20,900
And I've got your MATLAB
homeworks to return.

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,640
I keep sort of learning a little
more from your MATLAB results

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,810
and I think because
we spoke about it,

27
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,120
it would be worth speaking
just a little more.

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:41,030
So I'm going to take ten minutes
about this convection-diffusion

29
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:46,960
equation in which I put in a
coefficient d, a diffusivity,

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,670
just to help get
the units right.

31
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,450
So this is your example.

32
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,840
And it had d=1 of course.

33
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,290
Well first I realized
that later in the book

34
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,500
I completely forgot that
I discussed this problem.

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,280
About page 509, I think.

36
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,010
I discussed it a little bit.

37
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:15,120
And just because
it's worth, since we

38
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,010
invested a little time, the
little bit more will pay off.

39
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,430
So first of all,
the point is here

40
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,430
we have convection
competing with diffusion.

41
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,110
And always there's some
non-dimensional number.

42
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,290
Here it's called
the Peclet number.

43
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,810
Actually, there's an accent
on one of those e's, PÃ©clet

44
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,200
number.

45
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,680
Which measures the ratio,
the importance of convection

46
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,590
relative to diffusion.

47
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:52,640
So it's V times a length scale
in the problem, divided by d.

48
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,180
So then that has the
same units as that,

49
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,040
if the result is dimensionless.

50
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,330
Maybe you know the
Reynolds number.

51
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,200
This is very like the Reynolds
number, which also measures,

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,030
in Navier-Stokes equation,
the importance of convection,

53
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,620
advection, and diffusion.

54
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,750
There, in that equation,
the velocity V,

55
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,510
that's a non-linear
equation, Navier-Stokes,

56
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,490
it's tremendously important
and many codes to solve it,

57
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:33,280
lots of discussion,
theory still not complete.

58
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,630
In that problem, the V is u.

59
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,600
It's non-linear
and the term there

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,980
that we took as a
constant, as a given

61
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,510
constant V, it's the same as u.

62
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:52,200
So in the Reynolds number, this
would be u, a typical velocity

63
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,940
u, times a typical
length scale, which

64
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:02,250
would be like one in our zero to
one problem, divided by d or mu

65
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,240
or nu, whatever number we use.

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,060
So it's like the
Reynolds number.

67
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,410
And then it's turned
out for this problem

68
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,140
that people also use
a number that gets

69
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,740
called the cell
Peclet number where

70
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:23,040
the length is taken
to be half the cell

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,780
size, delta x over two.

72
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:33,020
Let me call that number P. So
that's P. And what's my point?

73
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,630
This equation's important enough
to sort of see a little more

74
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,870
about it than just the
numbers that come out.

75
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:47,670
So the MATLAB homework,
which you did really well,

76
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,850
set up finite
differences for this.

77
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,700
Right?

78
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,590
And found the eigenvalues
and solutions.

79
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,460
It's the eigenvalues I want
to say a little more about.

80
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:16,980
Because you set up a matrix
K over delta x squared and V

81
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,170
times the centered
difference over delta x.

82
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:30,930
And I guess I call that whole
combination L, and asked you

83
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:37,310
about the eigenvalues of L. And
you printed them out correctly.

84
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:43,610
But there's more there than
I think we have understood.

85
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,130
And I want to make some
more comments about that.

86
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,140
Because it's quite important.

87
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:55,710
And the comments are clearest if
I just reduce to a n equal two.

88
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,120
So that matrix, well
the off-diagonal part

89
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,240
of that matrix had some
number b and some number c.

90
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,330
Actually we could figure
out what was the b in this.

91
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,310
This produced a minus one,
two, minus one, right?

92
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:20,360
So part of the b was the minus
one over delta x squared.

93
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,970
And then from this was
a plus V and a one over,

94
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,960
well it's a centered
difference so I

95
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,310
should divide by 2 delta x.

96
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,510
Is that right?

97
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,210
Is that what a typical
off-diagonal thing

98
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,230
in the matrix that
you displayed?

99
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,610
That's what's coming from
the off-diagonal of K.

100
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,080
And this is what's coming
from the centered difference

101
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,030
C. And then what
would this c thing be?

102
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,850
Well the c is below the diagonal
so it's also that minus one

103
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,880
over delta x squared.

104
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,640
But now this is a difference,
so it's going to be a minus,

105
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,850
right?

106
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:09,390
I think those would have been
your entries for b and c.

107
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,910
So can we just think first,
what are the eigenvalues

108
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,460
of that matrix?

109
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,610
It's a two by two,
simple problem.

110
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,760
The trace is zero plus zero.

111
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,670
So that the eigenvalues
will be a plus minus pair

112
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,830
because they have
to add to zero.

113
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,330
And I think that's the
plus minus pair you get.

114
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,510
Let's just check.

115
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,230
What's our other check?

116
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,255
They will add to zero, the
plus the square root and minus

117
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,210
the square root.

118
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,430
And the product of
the two eigenvalues,

119
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,850
lambda_1 times
lambda_2, will be,

120
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,660
we have one of them is
plus, one with a minus,

121
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,360
so it'd be minus bc.

122
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,150
And that's correctly
the determinant.

123
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,680
So it's good.

124
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,930
These are the
correct eigenvalues.

125
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:03,430
Now let me ask you about
the signs of b and c.

126
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,670
If b and c have the same signs,
like maybe even equal, one,

127
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,180
one, what are the eigenvalues?

128
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,160
So in that symmetric
case if b and c

129
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,350
are equal the eigenvalues are?

130
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,040
Right here.

131
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,290
If b and c are equal,
say equal to one,

132
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,780
the eigenvalues are
plus and minus one.

133
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,620
But what if the
signs are opposite?

134
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,980
Everything changes.

135
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,590
What if b is one
and c is minus one?

136
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,700
That matrix would then
be a 90 degree rotation.

137
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,020
It would be anti-symmetric if
b was one and c was minus one.

138
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,290
Our formula is still correct,
but what does it give us?

139
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:56,500
If b is one and c is minus
one what have I got here?

140
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,730
I've got i.

141
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,070
So the eigenvalues change
from plus and minus one

142
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,270
in the symmetric case
to plus and minus i

143
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,820
in the anti-symmetric case.

144
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:12,550
And I think that's what you guys
saw at a certain level of V.

145
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,340
I hope you did because that was
the point about eigenvalues.

146
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,020
Now you may say, what
about the diagonal?

147
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,650
Well I claim diagonal
is very simple.

148
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,240
What's the diagonal?

149
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,275
Now I'm going to allow
myself a diagonal

150
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:34,720
and I'm just going to change--
What happens if I have a and a?

151
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Same entry on the diagonal.

152
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,190
What are the eigenvalues now?

153
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,810
This is just like,
a great chance

154
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,630
to do some basic
eigenvalue stuff.

155
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,380
What are the eigenvalues
of that matrix?

156
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,650
Well I've added a
times the identity.

157
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,000
I've just shifted
that matrix by a.

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,990
So the eigenvalues
all shift by a.

159
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,020
So the eigenvalues are
now a plus and minus.

160
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,450
So no big deal.

161
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,720
So you say that the a is
actually not important,

162
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,540
not the key to this
question of are they real

163
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,920
or do they go complex.

164
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,360
So the eigenvalues
of this are real when

165
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,770
b and c have the same sign.

166
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,300
If b and c have the same sign, I
have a square root, no problem.

167
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,700
When b and c have opposite
sign, what do I get?

168
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,530
When b and c have
opposite sign, I'm

169
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,460
taking the square root
of a negative number

170
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,910
and I've gone complex.

171
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:44,560
Do you see that the change
from real eigenvalues, which

172
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,040
gives a nice curve, to
complex eigenvalues,

173
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,380
which gives a very bumpy
curve for the solution,

174
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,250
just happens when
like, for example,

175
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,620
b-- Is it b that's going
to go to zero maybe?

176
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,770
And then beyond that?

177
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,470
Well this sign is for
sure negative, right?

178
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,760
So c is staying negative.

179
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:24,410
And originally for a little
delta x, b is also negative.

180
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:31,410
What's happening here?

181
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,530
I think that the transition
that you I hope observed

182
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,390
comes when b hits zero.

183
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,690
When the combination of V and
delta x is such that at b=0 we

184
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,480
switch from real eigenvalues
to complex eigenvalues.

185
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,510
And when is b=0?

186
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,080


187
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:01,690
That's when this negative
guy off the diagonal

188
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,780
just exactly cancels this one.

189
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,620
So b is zero when what?

190
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,610
So if this equals this,
one over delta x squared

191
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,300
is equal to V over two delta x.

192
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,480
Let me multiply
both sides by delta

193
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,360
x squared so that I
have a nice one there,

194
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,010
multiplying by delta x squared
will put a delta x up here.

195
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,820
And what have we discovered?

196
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,440
This is why I wanted
you to see it.

197
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,610
That the transition comes
when the Peclet number is one.

198
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,640
So that Peclet number,
that cell Peclet number

199
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,450
is exactly the point that
we observed of transition

200
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:53,930
from real eigenvalues
to complex eigenvalues.

201
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,510
And that's the transition.

202
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,300
So it's that combination,
this is the Peclet number,

203
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:09,690
cell Peclet number, it's that
combination, P_cell maybe.

204
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,600
We've done the
computations and now

205
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,700
we gradually get
back to the meaning.

206
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,480
And I just wanted
to take this step

207
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,890
back to the meaning to see
when do those numbers start

208
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,960
going complex.

209
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,660
You may have noticed
or you may not

210
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,120
have noticed that
it'll happen when

211
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,460
one of those, when that
upper diagonal changes sign.

212
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,140
Now you could say, okay
that's the eigenvalues.

213
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,500
What's the consequences for
the shape of the solution?

214
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,160
Well, I haven't
figured all that out.

215
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,530
I'd be happy to have some
more thoughts about that.

216
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:58,280
But what you noticed, I
think, in the computations is

217
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:05,080
if V got too big so that
that P was bigger than one,

218
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,400
if V got too big, so
convection was dominating

219
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,130
and our delta x was not
small enough to deal with it,

220
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:19,450
you should have seen the
points on the discrete values

221
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,580
were oscillating instead
of a proper smooth-- I

222
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,540
mean, the proper,
with a large V,

223
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,540
the correct solution, I think,
is practically nothing for here

224
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,200
and then it goes, this
is a really large V,

225
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,290
take V to a thousand
or something.

226
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,930
It climbs up like mad.

227
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,020
Here's the halfway
point where the load is.

228
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,130
And then it goes along here and
then it climbs down like mad

229
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,890
to satisfy the
boundary condition.

230
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,790
I didn't know that that's
what would happen for large V.

231
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,830
What I'm saying is,
and undoubtedly it

232
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,770
could be understood
physically, so I

233
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,450
guess what I'm saying
is there's just

234
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:05,370
more good stuff in any
computation than purely

235
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,450
the numbers.

236
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:11,050
And this is part of the
good stuff in that example.

237
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,750
I hope you liked that.

238
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,160
Because I mean, here you
did the work but then,

239
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,270
to understand it is
frankly still under way.

240
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:28,280
More thinking to do.

241
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,060
That's back to least squares.

242
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,680
Here's today's lecture.

243
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,170
So remember where we
started last time.

244
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,220
Au=b.

245
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,410
Last time I wrote f.

246
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,300
I regret it terribly.

247
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,800
I can't fix it.

248
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,260
But it's b.

249
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,590
I want b there to be
the right-hand side.

250
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:56,670
And I jumped to the equation
that determines the best u.

251
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:02,100
There's no exact u because
we've got too many equations.

252
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,970
You remember the set-up,
we have too many equations.

253
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,330
There's noise in
the measurements

254
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,720
and we can't get the
error down to zero.

255
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,660
There's some error.

256
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,950
And the best u was
given by that equation

257
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,120
and we want to say why.

258
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,220
And understand it from
two or three ways.

259
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,780
Calculus, geometry, everything.

260
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,600
Can I first, because I love
my little framework here,

261
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,770
fit it in because it's quite
important, this example

262
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,130
and then others fit in.

263
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,090
So u is our unknown as always.

264
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:46,660
Then the matrix A in the
problem produces an Au.

265
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,460


266
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,730
Now two things to
notice about e,

267
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,055
which, that's the same letter
I used for elongation, here

268
00:16:57,055 --> 00:16:59,500
it's standing for error.

269
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,550
Two things to notice.

270
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,500
One is that the source
term, which is b,

271
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:10,910
comes in at this point
of the framework.

272
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:16,570
When we had external forces
on springs and on masses

273
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,080
it came in at this point.

274
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,380
We had an f there.

275
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,610
So that's why I'd like to
keep those two separate.

276
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:28,160
The b's are like voltage
sources, they come in here.

277
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,820
The f's are will be like current
sources, they'll come in there.

278
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,590
Actually it's beautiful.

279
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,530
One more thing to notice.

280
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,200
A is coming with a minus sign.

281
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,200
In mechanics, in masses
and springs, we had e=Au.

282
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,960
Here it's natural
to work with this,

283
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,110
the error or the residual b-Au.

284
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,650
And that minus sign
is natural in physics

285
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:03,152
and in electrical
engineering and hydraulics,

286
00:18:03,152 --> 00:18:07,570
you know, flow-- Where's that
minus sign coming from in flow?

287
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,770
Well, flow goes from the
higher point to the lower.

288
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,600
Higher voltage to
the lower voltage.

289
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,320
And that usually
produces that minus sign.

290
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,520
No big deal, of course.

291
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,720
So that step is fine
with the framework.

292
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,770
What do we expect
in that middle step?

293
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:37,980
So what's our name for the
matrix that goes there?

294
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,510
Everybody's gotta
know this framework.

295
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,710
C, right?

296
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,840
Only I've been taking
unweighted least squares.

297
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,100
So for unweighted least
squares, C will be the identity.

298
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,090
And C doesn't show
in our equations.

299
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,010
So C is the identity
when there are

300
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,220
no weights, when all the
equations are equally reliable.

301
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,430
And that's pretty
common, of course.

302
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,630
But not always.

303
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,290
And we'll think, okay,
there is a weight e.

304
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:20,370
So w, which is Ce, is weighted
errors, you could say.

305
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,690
So the letter w comes
up appropriately again.

306
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,270
Weighted errors.

307
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,060
And then what's
the good weighting?

308
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,270
May I stay with C equal the
identity for the moment?

309
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,740
Unweighted least squares,
because that's by far the most

310
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,700
common.

311
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,190
And then w and e are the same.

312
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,370
C is the identity.

313
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,160
And finally, there's the
last step in our framework

314
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,560
where we always expect
to see A transpose.

315
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,330
And we do.

316
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,830
And we have to say why.

317
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,520
So that's where I
left it last time.

318
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,550
That this was the picture.

319
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,880
This is the equation.

320
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,910
If I had a matrix C, it
would go there and there.

321
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,600
Right?

322
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,590
Because I'd have b-Au and then
I'd apply C before A transpose.

323
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,270
So C would slip in there before
A transpose on both sides.

324
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,100
So that would,
with the C's there,

325
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,690
that would be the weighted
least squares equation.

326
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,840
You see that it would
be A transpose C

327
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,380
A instead of A transpose A, but
still the main facts are there.

328
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,850
So where does the
equation come from?

329
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:36,260
So one source, one way to get
the equation is from calculus.

330
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:42,130
From minimizing,
from minimizing.

331
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,540
Set a derivative
to zero, calculus.

332
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,420
And what's the quantity
we're minimizing?

333
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,260
We're minimizing
that squared error

334
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,180
because this is least squares.

335
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,800
We're minimizing this e
transpose e, the length of e

336
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,530
squared.

337
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,860
The sum of the
squares of the errors.

338
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,220
Which is (b-Au)
transpose (b-Au).

339
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,230


340
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,620
Again I could say where
to slip in the C matrix.

341
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,920
If there was one, it
would go in there.

342
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,100
C would go in there,
C would go in there.

343
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,940
There'd be a C in the equation.

344
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,850
But let's keep C
to be the identity.

345
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,120
So I minimized.

346
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,970
It's a quadratic.

347
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:35,400
It's got u's times
u's, so second degree.

348
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,550
And what's the coefficient
in that second degree part?

349
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:44,730
Well, the second degree part is
coming from (Au)^ transpose Au.

350
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,230
Right?

351
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,660
This times this is
going to be linear.

352
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,270
This times this is
going to be linear.

353
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,940
That times that is just
going to be a constant,

354
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,290
its derivative is zero.

355
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,890
But this times
this is altogether,

356
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:02,920
that times that is the u
transpose A transpose Au.

357
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,660
Right?

358
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,500
So that's the quadratic part.

359
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:16,530
And my only point is it's
like our old stiffness matrix.

360
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:21,910
We're seeing the matrix
in here is A transpose A.

361
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,750
In other words,
when I do calculus

362
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:32,580
and maybe I'd prefer to see
something than just compute

363
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,380
away, take derivatives
mechanically.

364
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:42,020
So I'm going to leave that
which is done in the text,

365
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,460
finding the derivative,
setting to zero.

366
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,520
And what does it give?

367
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,430
It gives us our equation.

368
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,430
So that equation will come
when I set the derivatives

369
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,170
of this thing to zero.

370
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:58,080
So that's one totally
okay approach.

371
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,240
But I like to see
a picture with it.

372
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,560
I hope that's alright.

373
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,130
To take the second
approach is to see

374
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:11,230
why A transpose w equal zero.

375
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,350
Why is that?

376
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,660
What's going on
in that key step?

377
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,990
This is always the key step.

378
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,060
This is like the set-up step.

379
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,320
This is the weighting step
with constants coming in.

380
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,630
And here's the key step.

381
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,360
Let's see that.

382
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,400
So my picture.

383
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,160
Let me draw that picture again.

384
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:45,210
And my example was in
three dimensions, so m=3.

385
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,100


386
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,700
I've got three equations.

387
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,110
The matrix A, oh I'm afraid
I don't remember what it was,

388
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,780
but I think it was
something like 1,

389
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:02,610
1, 1; 0, 1, 3,
was that maybe it?

390
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,950
Just to connect to last time.

391
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:12,100
And what I'm now calling b was
the vector [1, 2, 3] was it?

392
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,680
Or was it not?

393
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,840
It was [0, 1, 2] maybe?

394
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,890
That's right?

395
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,070
And what was the point?

396
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,320
If I draw the vector b
it goes there somewhere.

397
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,660
If I draw the first column
of A, it goes here somewhere.

398
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,480
If I draw the second column
of A, it goes there somewhere.

399
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:38,300
And if I draw all
combinations of these columns,

400
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:43,310
all combinations of that vector
and that vector, what do I get?

401
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,670
I get a plane.

402
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,560
I get a plane.

403
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,540
There it is.

404
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,410
That's the plane.

405
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,440
That's the plane.

406
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,820
This is from column one.

407
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,580
Here's column two.

408
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,860
This plane is the column
plane or column space.

409
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,230
It's the column
space of A because it

410
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,600
comes from the columns of A.

411
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,730
Now what's the point
about this plane?

412
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:15,020
The point is that if b is on
the plane then I'm golden.

413
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:20,310
If b is on the plane then b is
a combination of the columns,

414
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:26,210
that's what the plane is, and
I have a solution to Au=b.

415
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:35,440
So b on a plane, b on the
plane means Au=b is solvable.

416
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,570
And it could happen, of course.

417
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,510
Like perfect measurements.

418
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,670
But we can't expect it.

419
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,190
When we have three measurements
or 100 measurements or 10,000

420
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,390
measurements we can't
expect perfection.

421
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,780
So usually b will
be off the plane.

422
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,810
Now what?

423
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,860
What happens when
b is off the plane?

424
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,710
Let me just complete
that picture.

425
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,670
And you know what's coming.

426
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:15,490
If we're going to get-- Au or Au
hat is going to be on the plane

427
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,080
so I'm looking for
the best u hat.

428
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,090
Can I just erase
this to make space

429
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:25,560
for what you know
I'm going to draw?

430
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,910
Here are these little columns,
let me put them there.

431
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,400
What am I going to draw?

432
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,830
The projection.

433
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,710
The projection.

434
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,170
I'm going to draw,
what's the projection?

435
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,370
The projection is
the nearest point

436
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,530
that is in the plane to the
b that's not in the plane.

437
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,340
So here's the projection p.

438
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,350
I drop down this thing.

439
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,710
There's the projection
p, little p.

440
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,830
That's the projection
of b onto the plane.

441
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:58,210
I think your mind says yeah,
that's the right choice.

442
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:03,000
And do you want to
tell me what this?

443
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,610
That is the part that
we can't deal with.

444
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,120
The part we can't improve.

445
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,230
We've made it as small
as we could and it's e.

446
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:18,700
That's the error e and
this p is the best guy

447
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,250
that is in the plane.

448
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,350
Do you see that
this is the picture.

449
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,330
You get an actual picture
of what's going on.

450
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,150
You're splitting b,
the measurements,

451
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:36,820
into the part you can deal with,
the projection, the Au hat that

452
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,250
is in the column space.

453
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,280
It is a combination
of the columns.

454
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,360
Those points do lie
on a line if I'm

455
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,860
doing straight line fitting.

456
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:48,720
And the part that you can't deal
with, the e, the difference,

457
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,670
b-Au, which is not in the plane.

458
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,210
And now I'm still looking
for the equations.

459
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:56,710
Right?

460
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,720
I've just named some stuff.

461
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,270
But I haven't got an
equation for that projection.

462
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,280
So what's the key fact?

463
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,940
What's the key fact
in this picture that's

464
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,930
going to lead me to an
equation for p and e

465
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:20,260
and u hat and everything?

466
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:27,570
The key fact is that that
dotted line is perpendicular,

467
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,640
perpendicular to the plane.

468
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,920
If I'm looking for
the closest point,

469
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,790
everybody knows project, that's
what projection involves.

470
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,710
Go perpendicular.

471
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,480
This is a right angle.

472
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,560
That e is perpendicular
to the whole plane.

473
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,520
Not only perpendicular
to p, it's

474
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,501
perpendicular to
everybody in that plane.

475
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:49,000
Right?

476
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,730
I'm dropping the
perpendicular to the plane.

477
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,250
Do you accept that?

478
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,350
Because if you
do, we're through.

479
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,570
We just write down the
equations for perpendicular

480
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,060
and we've got what we
want from the picture

481
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,730
instead of from a calculation.

482
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,800
So what's the idea?

483
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,720
So e is perpendicular
to the first column.

484
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,200
So b in the plane,
we would be golden.

485
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,920
Let's suppose we're
not in the plane.

486
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,100
So now we have this 90 degree
angle, this perpendicular

487
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,700
projection.

488
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,670
And it tells me that
the first column--

489
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,000
oh I better name the columns.

490
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,740
Can I just call this column a_1?

491
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,490
That first column is a_1 and
the second column is a_2.

492
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,140
So those two columns,
whatever they are,

493
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:51,020
are the guys whose
combinations give us the plane.

494
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,990
And it's the plane that
we're projecting onto.

495
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,970
It's the plane of
all combinations

496
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,150
that comes up here.

497
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,450
So what's this 90 degree angle?

498
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:06,970
It says that a_1 is
perpendicular to p, right?

499
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:09,740
Sorry!

500
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,480
Say that right for me.

501
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,930
The first equation says that
a_1 and what are perpendicular?

502
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,590
e, thank you, e.

503
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:26,740
So the first equation says
that a_1 transpose e is zero.

504
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:33,350
And the second equation says
that a_2 transpose e is zero.

505
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:40,300
Those are my two equations.

506
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,060
I have to convert those
now into matrix language

507
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:47,370
because I've done them
two separate-- vector,

508
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,870
I mean vector
language, and I want

509
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,700
to get into matrix language.

510
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,980
But it's easy to do.

511
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:58,150
Here I have, look, if
I have two equations,

512
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:04,770
let's get a matrix here.

513
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:10,530
What's it saying? a_1
transpose and a_2 transpose,

514
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,310
what are those?

515
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,870
They're the rows of A transpose.

516
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:19,930
So the matrix way to say that
is A transpose e equal zero.

517
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:24,060
In other words, this is
saying both at once, right?

518
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,850
The first row of A
transpose times e

519
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,140
gives zero, the second row of
A transpose times e is zero.

520
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,200
So it's A transpose
e equal zero which

521
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:40,150
is what we wanted in this case
where w and e are the same.

522
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,430
Because C is the identity.

523
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,540
And let's just go one
step further and see.

524
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:51,050
That's A transpose
(b-Au hat) is zero.

525
00:31:51,050 --> 00:32:00,060
Remember this zero
stands for [0, 0], right?

526
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,120
I wanted to put the
two equations together.

527
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,010
So I've got two components
on the right-hand side.

528
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,280
And then I just
plugged in what b is.

529
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,880
And now everybody
sees it, right?

530
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,990
Everybody sees that
we've got the picture,

531
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:21,620
this 90 degree angle was
the key to these equations.

532
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:27,300
Because if I put A transpose
A u hat onto the other side,

533
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:34,820
I've got exactly the normal
equations that I wanted.

534
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:40,240
We're taking the time
to see the picture

535
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,610
and the form of the equations.

536
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:50,540
Then I can plug in the
numbers, but the thinking

537
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,950
is where the
equations come from.

538
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,230
We're there.

539
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,450
Now what to do next?

540
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,540
Now we've understood where
the equations come from.

541
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,910
I didn't go through the steps
of taking the derivatives,

542
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,420
but that would work.

543
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,120
Or this picture.

544
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,220
I love this picture.

545
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,000
Let me stay with that
a little bit longer.

546
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,570
What is u hat?

547
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:29,150
Can I just go over here to say,
okay what have we got here?

548
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:37,960
We started with Au=b and then we
got the projection was A u hat.

549
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,650
But now what is u hat?

550
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:45,160
I'm just going to assemble
things here. u hat,

551
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,870
we figured out by
the 90 degree angle,

552
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,640
comes from this equation,
which is that equation, which

553
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,780
is A transpose A u
hat equal A transpose

554
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,320
b, the central equation.

555
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,720
That's the central equation.

556
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,740
Now plug in u hat here so I get
a formula for the projection.

557
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,520
While we're doing all this
stuff we might just as well

558
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,400
put those two pieces
together and have

559
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,300
a formula for the projection.

560
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,810
So it's A times u hat-- I
hope you like this formula.

561
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,410
It's kind of goofy-looking
but you'll remember it.

562
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,220
What is u hat?

563
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,170
The whole point is that
this matrix is good.

564
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,330
It's square, it's
symmetric, it's invertible,

565
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,130
we'll have another
word about that.

566
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:42,120
And now I'll invert it.

567
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:48,470
Times A transpose b.

568
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:53,110
That's the goofy formula
that I wanted you to see.

569
00:34:53,110 --> 00:35:02,870
The projection of vector b onto
these columns of A comes from

570
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:09,270
applying this matrix, sometimes
I call it the matrix of four

571
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,830
A's.

572
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:16,440
Now it's worth looking
at that matrix.

573
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,040
Often I'll call
that matrix capital

574
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,070
P. It's the projection matrix.

575
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,120
You give me any vector b, I
multiply it by this matrix

576
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,380
and I get the projection.

577
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,610
It's just worth seeing
what this matrix P,

578
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:41,830
these four A's, what are
projection matrices like.

579
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,440
Now first of all,
when I have an inverse

580
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,700
of a product, any
reasonable person

581
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,180
would say okay, split
that into A inverse

582
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,640
times A transpose inverse
and simplify the whole thing.

583
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,060
And what will happen?

584
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,670
It's not going to be legal,
but let's just pretend.

585
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:05,780
If I split this into A inverse
times A transpose inverse

586
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,250
and simplify, what
do I get for P?

587
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,040
Do you see it?

588
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,350
I'll get A and if
I try to split this

589
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:19,930
into that, what do I have here?

590
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,520
I've got the identity.

591
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,790
That's the identity.

592
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,400
That's the identity.

593
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,370
The result is the identity.

594
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:36,240
That doesn't look good,
right? p is not the same as b.

595
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,880
This matrix cannot be split
into these two pieces.

596
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,710
A is rectangular,
that's its problem.

597
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,060
If A was square, oh yeah,
think about the case

598
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,460
when A is square.

599
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,270
Suppose m equals n.

600
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,500
That case'll be included here.

601
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,510
If m equals n and my matrix
is square and invertible and

602
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,050
golden then all this works.

603
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,130
The projection is
the identity matrix.

604
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,870
And what's with my picture?

605
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,240
What's my picture
look like in the case

606
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,090
where A is a square matrix?

607
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,420
Give it another column.

608
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,030
Fit this thing by a quadratic.

609
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,780
So if I was fitting instead
of by a straight line,

610
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,090
by a quadratic, it
turns out I'd have

611
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:29,980
zero squared, one squared and
three squared in that column.

612
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,790
I'd have a three
by three matrix.

613
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,960
It comes out to be invertible.

614
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,850
Now what's going on?

615
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,370
Now what's my problem Au=b?

616
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:49,880
Now suddenly m is still three,
but now n is three. b is?

617
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,800
And what happened to the
plane? b is in there.

618
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,800
And now what's there?

619
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,400
It's now the
combinations of what?

620
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,490
Why did that plane come in?

621
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,450
That was the combinations
of two columns.

622
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,580
But now I've got three.

623
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,930
The combinations
of three columns,

624
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:14,450
those three columns of an
invertible matrix is what?

625
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,160
Are you with me?

626
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,490
If I have a three by three
invertible matrix, these three

627
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,280
columns independent, pointing
off different directions,

628
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:31,300
not in a plane, then when I
take the combinations I get?

629
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,640
I get R^3.

630
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,000
I get the whole space.

631
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,560
I get everybody.

632
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,650
Every vector including
this b and any other b

633
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,150
you want to suggest
will be a combination

634
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,430
of these three guys.

635
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,520
So what's my picture here?

636
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,710
My picture is that plane
grew to be the whole space.

637
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:56,350
So what's the projection of b
onto the whole space? b itself.

638
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,071
And what's the error?

639
00:38:58,071 --> 00:38:58,570
Zero.

640
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,230
Good.

641
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,690
So that's the nice case.

642
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,360
That's the standard
case that we've

643
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,790
thought about in the
past when m equalled n.

644
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,650
In that case P is the identity
and that'd be all true.

645
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,780
But normally it's not.

646
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,970
So I want to come
back to this P just

647
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:22,780
to mention an
important fact about P.

648
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,920
And it comes again
from the picture.

649
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,190
So this is a projection.

650
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:31,850
This is what I'm calling
the projection matrix.

651
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:34,760
It's the matrix that
does the projection.

652
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,410
And there it is.

653
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:40,310
Four A's in a row
that multiplies b.

654
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,910
Now here's my little question.

655
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,910
So linear algebra's full
of these different kinds

656
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,300
of matrices.

657
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,630
Rotations, reflections,
symmetric matrices,

658
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,830
Markov matrices, so it's just
every problem has matrices.

659
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,160
Now here we have a
projection matrix.

660
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:07,010
Now what I want to know is what
happens if I project again?

661
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:10,900
If I take the vector b,
any vector b, I project it

662
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,090
and then I project again.

663
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:18,820
So project twice and just tell
me, you know what will happen.

664
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,630
I'm back to this picture.

665
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:26,580
I project b to P and
now I project again.

666
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,950
Where do I go?

667
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,490
Same place, right?

668
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,670
Once I'm in the
plane the projection

669
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,270
stays right where it is.

670
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,880
So what does that tell me?

671
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:44,840
That tells me that P squared
on b is the same as P on b.

672
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,700
If I project twice, no change.

673
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,010
It's the same as
projecting once.

674
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:55,110
So the projection matrix has the
property that P squared is P.

675
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,730
And actually, we should
be able to see it

676
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,600
if I write out this whole
miserable thing twice.

677
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,590
So now I'm going to
be up to eight A's.

678
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:09,320
Sorry about this, but I
promise not to do P cubed.

679
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,250
A times (A transpose A) inverse
times A transpose, that's

680
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:20,840
one P. I'll write it again.

681
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:26,440
There's the second P.
So that's P squared.

682
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,770
Do you see anything good there?

683
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:33,110
Do you see in here A
transpose A, that combination

684
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,980
and that combination there.

685
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:39,880
This cancels that to
give the identity.

686
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,500
And what am I left with?

687
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,390
I'm left with A, the inverse
times A transpose, which

688
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:51,530
was exactly P. The algebra
is just coming along

689
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:54,930
with the understanding
that we know.

690
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,580
So that's the projection matrix.

691
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,880
So this is the theory of
projections in a nutshell,

692
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,670
in a nutshell.

693
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,780
This is projections onto
the column space of A.

694
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:14,690
Now I have to remind you
about one little math point.

695
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,350
Not so little, I guess.

696
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:20,400
How could I say little for math?

697
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,990
Is A transpose A invertible?

698
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:26,790
We're plowing along
as if it is, that's

699
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,490
going to be our assumption.

700
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,170
But what's the condition
for A transpose A

701
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:35,170
to be invertible, which
allows all this to work?

702
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:43,120
When is A transpose
A invertible?

703
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,960
What I'm doing here
now is I'm separating

704
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,010
the positive definite one,
when A transpose A is positive

705
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:56,850
definite, the good normal case
when all our equations work,

706
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:01,450
from the semi-definite
one where we overlooked

707
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,570
the fact that A transpose
A-- where somehow

708
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:06,660
the experiment
wasn't well set up,

709
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:12,180
we got an A transpose
A that is singular.

710
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,470
And just to see, when
could that happen?

711
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:20,450
Let me just remind you.

712
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:21,270
This is important.

713
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:26,730
Why don't I give it some space.

714
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,810
It's really straightforward.

715
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:34,780
Let me just go through
those steps again.

716
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:42,650
If it's not invertible, if
some A transpose A u is zero.

717
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,300
This is always the
risk that we have

718
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:49,430
to check out and be sure we
don't have and understand.

719
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:54,020
So if A transpose Au is zero,
then that would lead us,

720
00:43:54,020 --> 00:44:00,430
I could multiply both
sides by u transpose.

721
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,310
u transpose zero, right?

722
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,380
Safe.

723
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,750
Multiply whatever
that u might be,

724
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,090
multiply both sides
by u transpose.

725
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:12,350
But what is u transpose zero?

726
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:17,720
Zero, nothing there.

727
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,680
Now how do I
understand this guy?

728
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,130
Well you remember the key.

729
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,040
Everybody remembers the key?

730
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,680
You look at that
thing and you say hey,

731
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,540
if I put in parentheses
in the right place that's

732
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,410
the length of Au squared.

733
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:38,500
So that's the small trick that
this multiplying by u transpose

734
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,430
and then seeing what
you've got that we've done

735
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,460
and you should know it.

736
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,250
And now if the length squared
is zero, what does that

737
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,340
tell me about Au?

738
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,290


739
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:54,520
If I have a vector here
whose length is zero,

740
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,740
that vector must be?

741
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,920
Zero.

742
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,620
Zero vector's the only one for
which the sum of the squares

743
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,050
will give zero.

744
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:08,480
And if Au is zero I
could multiply both sides

745
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,590
by A transpose and
complete the loop.

746
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,810
Actually I thought of that when
I was swimming this morning,

747
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:21,540
that line.

748
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:27,450
Just to see once again when,
it's sort of interesting then.

749
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:30,620
A transpose Au equal zero
which is the bad thing

750
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:34,780
we hope we don't deal with.

751
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,360
And when does it happen?

752
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,770
It happens when Au is zero.

753
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:45,180
So our assumption
always has to be this,

754
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,310
that there aren't any
u's, except the zero

755
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,900
vector of course, that's
always going to happen,

756
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:59,420
but we always have to assume
that Au is never zero.

757
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,320
So we have to avoid this.

758
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:12,880
So to avoid that assume A has
-- this is the key word --

759
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,390
independent columns.

760
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:21,260
Since this is a
combination of the columns,

761
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,280
independent columns means what?

762
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,150
It means that the only
combination of the columns

763
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:31,150
to give zero is the
zero combination.

764
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:34,040
So did I have independent
columns over here?

765
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,490
I sure did.

766
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:39,300
That column and that column were
off in different directions,

767
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,640
they were independent.

768
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,030
And that's why I
knew we were fine.

769
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,190
A transpose A was zero.

770
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:52,520
I would have to really
struggle to find a,

771
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,210
well I'd have to think a
bit to find an example where

772
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,520
we run into trouble.

773
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:04,270
These squares, well I certainly
could in many applications,

774
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:07,030
but the straightforward
applications

775
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,490
of fitting a straight
line, A is going

776
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:13,920
to be a column vector of ones
and a column vector of times

777
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:20,460
and those are different
directions and no problem.

778
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,290
So that's A transpose A.

779
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:30,430
What else to do with this topic?

780
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,220
Because there's a whole
world of estimation.

781
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,490
I mean, statistics is looking
over our shoulder I guess.

782
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:41,120
Really, we should realize
that a statistician

783
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:46,270
is, say, yeah, I know that
but, and then going on.

784
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:52,850
And what is that guy, what
more does he have to say?

785
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:55,250
So you've got the central ideas.

786
00:47:55,250 --> 00:48:01,280
I guess the statistician
comes in in this, that's

787
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,780
the statistical constant now.

788
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,910
And what do
statisticians compute?

789
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:14,840
They say you've
got errors, right?

790
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,289
And of course, in
any particular case

791
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:19,080
we don't know what that
error is, otherwise

792
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,260
we could take it out and
we'd get exact solutions.

793
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,550
We don't know what the error is.

794
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:32,350
What is reasonable
to know about errors?

795
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:43,190
We're doing a little
statistics here.

796
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,760
Somehow that error,
that particular error

797
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,550
of the experiment that we
happen to run, and if we ran it

798
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,130
again we'd get a
different error,

799
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:56,970
those errors come out of some
sort of error population.

800
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,900
Like dark matter or something.

801
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,740
Just like, a bunch of
errors are out there, noise.

802
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,610
And what could we
reasonably assume

803
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,950
that we know about the noise?

804
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:14,840
We could assume that its
average is zero, mean zero.

805
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,741
So statisticians always,
that just resets the meter.

806
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:19,240
Right?

807
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,000
If you had a meter or a clock
that was always three minutes

808
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,730
ahead (like this one)
you would reset it.

809
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:30,380
And we'll do that one day.

810
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:34,590
So you'd reset to
get the average zero.

811
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,990
But that doesn't mean
every error is zero, right?

812
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,910
That just means the
average error is zero.

813
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,110
So what's the other number?

814
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:46,170
What's the other number
that statisticians live on?

815
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,420
It's the deviation
or its square,

816
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,610
which is called the variance.

817
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:52,250
Right.

818
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,420
Variance.

819
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:56,780
So that's the thing
that you could

820
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:01,130
assume that the errors have mean
zero and have some variance.

821
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:05,220
You could suppose that you knew
something about the variance.

822
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,000
You don't know the
individual errors,

823
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:14,270
but you know whether the
errors are like, are very small

824
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:20,650
or close to zero or large.

825
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,410
So this is a small variance.

826
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:26,140
So one over sigma is
sort of that distance.

827
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,220
One over sigma.

828
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:33,270
Here, this is a
large variance where

829
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:37,650
the magnitude of the error
could be much larger from this.

830
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,940
So those are the two
numbers, mean zero,

831
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,720
that leaves us just one
number, and the variance,

832
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,040
the standard deviation sigma
or the variance sigma squared.

833
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:55,050
One moment on these squares.

834
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,770
Let me just say what the
weighting matrix would be.

835
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:02,780
And then I can tell
you in a moment why.

836
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,190
What would the
weighting matrix be

837
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:09,910
if our three
equations, you know,

838
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,895
that came from one
measurement and this

839
00:51:11,895 --> 00:51:13,520
came from a second
measurement and this

840
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,940
came from a third measurement.

841
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,670
If they came from
different meter readers

842
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:21,830
with different
variances, suppose,

843
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:28,270
then the right C matrix will be
a diagonal matrix, beautiful.

844
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:34,060
And what sits up there, what
sits there, what sits there?

845
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,660
We don't have spring
constants anymore.

846
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,340
We have statistics constants.

847
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,080
And what's the number
that goes there?

848
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,340
That one is the third guy.

849
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:49,410
So it's associated with
the third measurement.

850
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:55,230
It's one over sigma_3 squared.

851
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:57,720
Those are the numbers
that go on the diagonal,

852
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,710
the inverses of the variances.

853
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:03,360
And just to see that
that makes sense.

854
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:11,430
If that number is unreliable,
if it has a large variance

855
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:18,810
then I want to give it
little weight, right?

856
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:21,840
If this third meter
is very unreliable

857
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,840
I'm not going to
throw it out entirely,

858
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,710
but I know that it's
variance is large

859
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:31,990
and therefore I'll weight
that equation only a little,

860
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,550
with a small weight.

861
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:39,530
Suppose sigma_2, so this guy
is one over sigma_2 squared,

862
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:44,570
suppose this is an
extremely reliable meter.

863
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:48,100
That measurement has
little expected error.

864
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,970
Then I want to
weight it heavily.

865
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:56,800
So it has a small sigma_2 and
that gives it a large weight.

866
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,580
And sigma_1 similarly.

867
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:04,270
So that's the
weighting for the case

868
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:08,770
that you can actually
hope to use in practice.

869
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,820
I'll just mention that
statisticians would also

870
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,620
say, wait a minute.

871
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:17,350
Measurement two and measurement
three might be interconnected.

872
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:19,290
They might not be independent.

873
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,980
There might be a covariance.

874
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:25,500
And then that gets them into
more great linear algebra

875
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,360
actually.

876
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,360
But if I want a
diagonal matrix C

877
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,280
that's the case when my
measurements are independent.

878
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:41,210
And basically, I'm
whitening the system.

879
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:44,890
I'm making the system white,
making it all equal variances

880
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:46,790
by rescaling.

881
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,720
By weighting the equations.

882
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,450
Okay, thanks.

883
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:55,030
Wednesday is the
next big example

884
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:57,830
of the framework with b and f.

885
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:59,380
See you then.
