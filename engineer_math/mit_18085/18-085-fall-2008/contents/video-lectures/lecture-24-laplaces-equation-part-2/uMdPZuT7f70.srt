9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,550
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK,
it's Laplace again today.

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,020
Laplace's equation.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,710
And trying to describe--
That's a big area that's

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,370
a lot of people have
worked on for centuries.

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,900
And for the early
centuries, there

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,070
were always analysis methods.

15
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,460
And that's what we got
started on last time.

16
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,490
And we'll do a bit more.

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,470
There's no way we
could do everything

18
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,030
that people have worked
on years and years,

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,830
trying to find
ideas about solving.

20
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,970
But we can get the idea.

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,390
And this part, then,
is in the section

22
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,210
called Laplace's equation.

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,050
And the exam Wednesday
would include

24
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,070
some of these constructions.

25
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,070
So this is what we
did last time, we

26
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,440
identified a whole family of
solutions to Laplace's equation

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,590
as polynomials in x and y.

28
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,120
Of increasing degree n, and
then when we wrote them in polar

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,880
form they were fantastic.
r^n*cos(n*theta)

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,360
and r^n*sin(n*theta).

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,350
So my idea is just, we've
got them, now let's use them.

32
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,900
So how to use these solutions?

33
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,380
Because we can take
combinations of them,

34
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,590
we can create series
of sines and cosines.

35
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,750
So I'll do that first.

36
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,340
Series.

37
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,660
And then Green's function,
that's the name you remember,

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,240
we've seen it before.

39
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,180
That's the solution when the
right side is a delta function.

40
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,600
When we have Poisson's
equation with a delta there.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,930
So that an important one.

42
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:17,790
And then well, a big part
of two-dimensional and

43
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,930
three-dimensional problems
is that the region itself,

44
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,600
not just the equation
but the region itself,

45
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,160
can be all over the place.

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,660
We'll solve when
the region is nice,

47
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,470
like a circle or a
square, and then there

48
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:39,360
is a way to, in principle,
to get other regions.

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,630
To change from a crazy region
to a circle or a square,

50
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,470
and then solve it there.

51
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,240
So that's called
conformal mapping.

52
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,410
And I can't let the whole
course go without saying

53
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,920
a word or two about that.

54
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,680
But somehow among
numerical methods,

55
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,880
it's conformal mapping--
There are packages

56
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,400
that do conformal mapping.

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,020
But they're not the
central way to solve

58
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,720
these equations numerically.

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,630
Finite differences,
finite elements are.

60
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,430
And that's what's
coming next week.

61
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:27,010
So this is the future; this
is the present, right there.

62
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,270
So, can I just start
with an example or two?

63
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,680
Like, how would you solve
Laplace's equation in a circle?

64
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,640
So, in a circle.

65
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,370
This is the idea here.

66
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,390
I have Laplace's equation.

67
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,620
OK, so I've got a
whole lot of solutions.

68
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,300
And I've even got chalk
to write them down.

69
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,050
OK, so here's my circle,
might as well make it

70
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,550
the unit circle.

71
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,390
Radius one.

72
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,530
And inside here is Laplace.

73
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,340


74
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,630
u_xx+u_yy=0.

75
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,140
No sources inside.

76
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,190
So we have to have
sources from somewhere,

77
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,640
and they will come
from the boundary.

78
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,590
So on the boundary,
we keep-- Let

79
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,490
me think of u as temperature.

80
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,820
So I set the temperature
on the boundary. u

81
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,620
equals some u_0,
some known function.

82
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,980
This is given.

83
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,680
This is the boundary condition.

84
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,780
This is the given
boundary condition.

85
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,950
And it's a function of-- I'm
going to use polar coordinates.

86
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,690
Polar coordinates are
natural for a circle.

87
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:52,830
So this is at r=1, so maybe
I should say on the boundary,

88
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:59,490
which is r=1, and going around
the angle theta, is given.

89
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,270
This is u_0(theta).

90
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:08,090
That's my given
boundary condition.

91
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,850
This problem is named
after Dirichlet,

92
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,800
because it's like giving
fixed conditions and not

93
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,720
Neumann conditions.

94
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,800
OK, so I'm just looking
for a combination.

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,440
For a function that
solves Laplace's equation

96
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,050
inside the circle, and
takes on some values

97
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,790
around the boundary.

98
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,710
And of course the
boundary values

99
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,030
might be plus one on the top
and minus one on the bottom.

100
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,180
Or the boundary condition
might vary around,

101
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,390
it might, variable
then come around.

102
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,970
But notice that this
is a periodic function.

103
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:57,170
This is 2pi-periodic, because
the problem's the same.

104
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,020
If I increase theta by 2pi I've
come back to the same point.

105
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,030
So it's got to have that value.

106
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:12,180
OK, so well let me give you
a couple of examples first.

107
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:18,120
Suppose u_0, suppose this
function-- Example 1, easy.

108
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,580
Suppose u_0 is sin(3theta).

109
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,890


110
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,030
So that means I've
got a region here,

111
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,300
I'm prescribing its
temperature on the boundary.

112
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,370
And I want to say what
does it look like inside?

113
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,090
And I'm prescribing right
now the sin(3theta),

114
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,310
so there theta is zero, so it's
zero, the boundary condition's

115
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,610
zero there, climbs to one, back
to zero, down to minus one.

116
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,940
back to zero.

117
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,170
Three times, and again comes
back to zero again there.

118
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:02,550
So, I'm looking for a solution
to Laplace's equation --

119
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,110
and I've got a
pretty good list --

120
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,990
that will match
u_0 when r is one.

121
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,440
So that's the
boundary, r is one.

122
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,690
So you can tell me what it is.

123
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,450
So you can solve this
problem, right away.

124
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:26,550
The answer is u of r and theta
is, what function will--?

125
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,750
Remember I've got
my eye on that list.

126
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,610
You too, right?

127
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,680
I'm just trying to get
one that when r is one

128
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,190
it will match sin(3theta).

129
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,570
What's the good guy?

130
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,760
It'll be on that list.

131
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,120
Which of those,
by itself, here I

132
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:53,480
don't need a series because I've
got such a neat u_0 function.

133
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,250
I'll get it right
with one answer,

134
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,090
and what is that answer?

135
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,200
I look there.

136
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:09,870
I say what do I do, so that at
r=1, I'll match sin(3theta).

137
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,740
I'll use r cubed sin(3theta).

138
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,210
So the good winner will
be r cubed sin(3theta).

139
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,750


140
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,670
That solves Laplace's equation.

141
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,850
We checked it out, it's the
imaginary part of x+iy cubed.

142
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,160
We could write it in x
and y coordinates if we

143
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,180
wanted but we don't want to.

144
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,750
And it matches when r is
one, it gives us sin(3theta).

145
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:42,560
That's it.

146
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,210
And of course I
could take any one.

147
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,740
Now suppose I'm trying
to match something that's

148
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,510
not as simple as sin(3theta).

149
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,920


150
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,740
In that case, I may
have to use all of them.

151
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,730
I mean, it's very, very
fluky that one term

152
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,920
is going to do it.

153
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,430
Usually, so my main
examples would be

154
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,090
I'll have to match all of them.

155
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,770
So what do I do?

156
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:19,360
At r=1, so my general solution
is a combination of these guys

157
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,270
I worked so hard to get.

158
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,970
The solution is of this form.

159
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,310
It's some a_0, the constant.

160
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:33,080
And then a_1*r*cos(theta),
and b_1*r*sin(theta).

161
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,520


162
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:42,540
And a_2 r squared cos(2theta).

163
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,160
And so on.

164
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,120
I'm just taking
any combination of,

165
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,970
I'm using the a's
as the coefficients

166
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,670
for the cosine guys.

167
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:59,510
And the b's, b_1, b_2, b_3
would be the coefficients

168
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,510
for the sine one.

169
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,020
OK, that's my general solution.

170
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,130
That solves Laplace's equation.

171
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,500
Every term did, so
every combination will.

172
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,520
Now, set r=1.

173
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,050
To match that r=1--
and match the boundary.

174
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:24,000
And match u_0(theta), the
required temperature around

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,850
the-- on the boundary.

176
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,230
The boundary being
where r is one.

177
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,010
So this is set r=1.

178
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:40,570
So then u_0(theta), this given
thing, has to match this,

179
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,930
when r is one.

180
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:51,200
So it's a_0 plus a_1, now what
do I write here? r is one,

181
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,210
so it's just cos(theta).

182
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,790


183
00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:00,540
Now, b_1, r is one, so
I just have sin(theta).

184
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:06,690
And I have an a_2*cos(2theta),
and a b_2*sin(2theta),

185
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:12,890
and so on.

186
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,330
Here, just let me
put it together now.

187
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,630
I'm given any
temperature distribution

188
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,600
around the boundary.

189
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,900
It's in equilibrium,
the temperature,

190
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:34,050
where if the temperature's
high near that point

191
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,870
and low over here
the temperature

192
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,120
inside will gradually
go from that high point,

193
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,120
dot dot dot dot,
to the lower one.

194
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,170
By matching on the boundary.

195
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,750
And this is the match
on the boundary.

196
00:11:49,750 --> 00:12:02,410
Now, this is really a lead in
to the last part of this course.

197
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,120
So whose name is associated
with a series like that?

198
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,450
Fourier.

199
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,760
You recognize that as what's
called a Fourier series.

200
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,240
So the idea is, I'm given
these boundary values.

201
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,070
I find their expansion
in sines and cosines,

202
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,570
and that's what
we'll do in November.

203
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,140
And then I've got it.

204
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,150
Then I know the a's and the b's.

205
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,340
And then basically I just put in
the r's. r and r squareds and r

206
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,690
cubeds and so on.

207
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,950
So then I've got
the answer inside.

208
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,510
In principle it's so easy.

209
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,410
So, why is it easy, though?

210
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,600
First, it's easy because it's
a circle we're working in.

211
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,750
If I was in an ellipse or
a strange shape, forget it.

212
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,270
I mean, so this
is quite special.

213
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:09,750
And secondly, it's easy because
these functions are so nice.

214
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,080
Fourier works with the
best functions ever.

215
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,000
These sines and cosines.

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,310
So I'll find a way to
find those coefficients,

217
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,460
the a's and the b's.

218
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,710
Even though there
are lots of them,

219
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,580
I'll be able to pick
them off one at the time,

220
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,540
the a's and b's.

221
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,610
Once I know the a's and
b's, I know the answer.

222
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,860
So do you see this is
in principle a great way

223
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,880
to solve it?

224
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,660
In fact, it's the way
we used over here,

225
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,440
when my u_0 was sin(3theta),
then the only term in its

226
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,710
Fourier series
was 1*sin(3theta).

227
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,910
And then the solution was
1 r cubed sin(3theta).

228
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,370
So you can learn
things from this.

229
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,280
For example, oh,
what can you learn?

230
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,830
One thing I noticed,
an important feature

231
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:15,800
of Laplace's equation is that
this solution inside the circle

232
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,110
gets very smooth.

233
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,700
The boundary conditions could
be like a delta function.

234
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,530
I could say that
on the boundary,

235
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,440
the temperature is zero
everywhere except at that

236
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,110
point it spikes.

237
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,630
So I could take u_0--

238
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,050
So example 2, and I
won't do it in full,

239
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:46,670
would be u_0 on the boundary
equal a delta function.

240
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,510
A spike at that one point.

241
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:55,150
So all the heat is coming from
the source at that one point.

242
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:59,330
Like I've got a
fire going there.

243
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,750
Keeping the rest of
the boundary frozen,

244
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,630
the heat's kind of
going to come inside.

245
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,750
So then how would I proceed?

246
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:16,660
Well, if I have this boundary
value as a delta function,

247
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,780
I look for its Fourier
series, and it's

248
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,820
a very important,
beautiful, Fourier

249
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,350
series for a delta function.

250
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,940
Would you want to know it?

251
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,690
I mean, we'll know
it well in November.

252
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,420
Would you want to
know it in October?

253
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,980
This is Halloween, I
guess, so delta-- I'll

254
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,330
tell you what it is.

255
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,060
Since you insist.

256
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:50,170
delta(theta) I think will--
I think there's a 1/(2pi)

257
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,980
or something.

258
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,010
Ah, shoot.

259
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,470
We'll get it exactly right.

260
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:06,090
It's something like 1 and 2
cos(theta) and 2cos(2theta),

261
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,270
I'm not sure about the 2pi.

262
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:14,740
2cos(2theta), and
2cos(3theta), and so on.

263
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,340
We'll know it well
when we get there.

264
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,584
What I notice about this delta
function-- Of course you're

265
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:24,250
going to expect the
delta function being

266
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,840
somehow a little bit strange.

267
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:32,190
At theta=0, what does
that series add up to?

268
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,160
Just so you begin to get
a hang of Fourier series.

269
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,860
At theta=0, what does
that series look like?

270
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,510
Well, all these
cosine thetas are?

271
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,350
One.

272
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:50,460
So this series at
theta=0 is 1+2+2+2+2...

273
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,900
It's infinite.

274
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,860
And that's what we want.

275
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,080
The delta function is
infinite at theta=0.

276
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,330
And it's periodic, of course,
so that if I go around

277
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,060
to theta=2pi I'll come
back to zero again.

278
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:12,180
At theta=pi, you could
sort of see, well, yeah,

279
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,770
theta=pi is a sort
of interesting point.

280
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,000
At theta is pi,
what's the cosine?

281
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,040
Is negative one, right?

282
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,530
But then the cos(2pi)
will be plus one.

283
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:28,540
So at theta=pi, I think I'm
getting a one minus a two plus

284
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,160
a two, minus a two, plus a two.

285
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,650
You see, it's doing its best to
cancel itself out and give me

286
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:41,260
the zero that I want, the
theta=pi over on the left side

287
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,450
of the circle.

288
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:49,150
Anyway, so that's
an extreme example.

289
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,150
But now, what's the
temperature inside?

290
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,540
Can you just follow
the same rule?

291
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,380
What will be the
temperature inside?

292
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,610
If that's the delta
function, if that's

293
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,510
the right series, whatever,
it might be a 4pi,

294
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:10,210
I'm not sure, for that.

295
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,420
Now, you can tell me
what's the solution, what's

296
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,720
the temperature distribution
inside a circle when

297
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:26,040
one point on the boundary has a
heat source, a delta function.

298
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,310
What do I do?

299
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,420
How do I match
this with this guy?

300
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,060
I just put in the r's, right?

301
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,860
If this is what it's supposed
to match when r is one,

302
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:44,840
then when r is-- So maybe
I'll put it under here.

303
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:53,710
So the u(r,theta),
from the delta guy,

304
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,800
is just put in the r's.

305
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:06,960
1+2r*cos(theta), and 2 r
squared cos(2theta), and so on.

306
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:17,230
OK, and eventually 2 r to the
100th cos(100theta), and more.

307
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:24,970
OK, I write this out, you could
say why did he write this down?

308
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,510
I wanted to make this point
that the important feature

309
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,430
of the solution to
Laplace's equation

310
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:37,290
is how smooth it gets when
you go inside the region.

311
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,670
And why is that?

312
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:45,970
Because at r=1/2, this term
is practically gone, right?

313
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,930
If I go halfway into the circle,
this term is practically gone.

314
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,040
1/2 to the hundredth power.

315
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,090
And if I go to the center of the
circle, it's completely gone.

316
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,110
In fact, what's the value
at the center of the circle?

317
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:07,580
What's the temperature
at the center?

318
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,600
1/2pi.

319
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,470
This is the only term
that's remaining.

320
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:19,940
And it's the average,
around the circle.

321
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,830
That makes physical
sense, I guess.

322
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,030
Since the whole thing's
completely isotropic,

323
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:35,330
we've got a perfect
circle, the value

324
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,690
at the center of
the circle is always

325
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,750
the average going around.

326
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,880
The constant term in the
Fourier series, this guy.

327
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,790
We'll get to know
that one very well.

328
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,480
That's the average.

329
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,100
You're just seeing a little bit
of Fourier series early, here.

330
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:02,230
But my point is that you
could have high oscillation

331
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,770
around the boundary,
that damps out

332
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,480
because of these powers of r.

333
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,300
And inside the circle it's
only the low order terms

334
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:22,090
that begin to take over.

335
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,360
This is the kind of
trick you have, or not

336
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,660
trick but the kind
of method that you

337
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:34,750
can use for solving Laplace's
equation by an infinite series.

338
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,220
Of course, a person
who wants a number

339
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,440
can complain that,
wait a minute,

340
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,640
how do I use that
infinite series?

341
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,860
Well, of course, if you
wanted to know the temperature

342
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,120
at a particular point
you'd have to plug in

343
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,700
that value of r,
that value of theta,

344
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:57,770
add up the terms until you
hope that they become so

345
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,450
small that you can ignore them.

346
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,810
So infinite series is
one form of a solution.

347
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:12,510
And somehow these are examples--
I should use the words

348
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,910
separation of variables.

349
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:20,830
Separation of variables
is the golden idea

350
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,800
in this analysis stuff.

351
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,910
Separation of variables means
I got the r part separated

352
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,760
from the theta part.

353
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,800
And that worked great,
worked well for a circle.

354
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,230
Let's see, maybe for a square I
could try to separate x from y.

355
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:46,800
Maybe there's a homework
problem, a solution that

356
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,130
separates x from y, I think
is something like-- So this

357
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,910
would be another family.

358
00:22:53,910 --> 00:23:00,810
Good for squares, something
like sin(kx) sinh times,

359
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:08,070
so this separation is something
in x times something in y.

360
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,670
Again I'm just
mentioning things.

361
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,390
I think that that solves
Laplace's equation

362
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,710
because if I take
two x derivatives,

363
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,560
that'll bring down k squared,
but it'll flip the sign, right?

364
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,820
These two derivatives of
the sine will be a minus.

365
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,380
And if I take-- I
need a ky there.

366
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,240
And if I took two derivatives
of this hyperbolic sine,

367
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,570
you remember that's the
e^(ky) and the e^(-ky).

368
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,650
The two derivatives
of that will bring out

369
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,800
a k squared with a plus sign.

370
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,390
So two x derivatives bring
out the minus k squared,

371
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,260
two y derivatives bring
out a plus k squared

372
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,440
and together that solves
Laplace's equation.

373
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,680
We'll check that in
our homework problem.

374
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,410
So there would be an
example, good for a square.

375
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:13,950
So, there's hope to do an exact
solution in a special region.

376
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:19,700
Now, what's this
Green's function idea?

377
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:26,480
OK, that's now this
is another thing.

378
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:35,770
So last time we appreciated
that this combination x+iy was

379
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,650
magic.

380
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:42,880
The idea was that we could
take any function of x+iy,

381
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,390
and it solves
Laplace's equation.

382
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:52,420
Can we just see, sort of
very crudely why that is?

383
00:24:52,420 --> 00:25:00,310
We saw the pattern, we
saw x+iy to the nth.

384
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:04,520
Sort of, we went as far as
n=3, checked it all out.

385
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,120
But now, really if I want to
be able to-- why does that

386
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,820
solve Laplace's
equation for any n?

387
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,970
Should I just plug that
into Laplace's equation?

388
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:24,740
What happens if I take the two
x derivatives of this thing?

389
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,070
So this going to be a
typical function of x+iy,

390
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,710
typically nice one.

391
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,080
If I take two x
derivatives, I want

392
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,520
to plug it in and
see that it really

393
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,920
does solve Laplace's equation.

394
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,730
So two x derivatives of
that will give me what?

395
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,050
The first x derivative
will bring down an n

396
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,420
times this thing to the n-1.

397
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,890
And then the next x derivative
will bring down an n-1 times

398
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,490
this thing to the n-2.

399
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,550
So that'll be the u_xx.

400
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:05,240
And what about u_yy?

401
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,580
This is my u.

402
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:14,260
I'm sort of just checking
that yes, this-- See again,

403
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,440
see if it still works Friday
what worked Wednesday.

404
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,260
That this x+iy is magic and
functions of it like powers,

405
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,230
exponentials,
logarithms, whatever,

406
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,530
all solve Laplace's equation.

407
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:33,270
OK, so we did u_xx,
and we got-- easy.

408
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,820
Now, what happens with u_yy?

409
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,860
Do you see the point?

410
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

411
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,140
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Sorry opposite sign.

412
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,710
And why does the sign
come out opposite?

413
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,260
Because of that guy.

414
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,300
Yeah, it's the
chain rule, right?

415
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,900
The derivative of
this with respect to y

416
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,250
will give me an n times this
thing to one lower power.

417
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,430
Times the derivative
of what's inside.

418
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:01,470
And the derivative of
what's inside is an i.

419
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,730
And then the second
derivative will bring down

420
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:10,720
an n-1, this guy will be down
to n-2, another i will come out

421
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,140
and-- Just what you want, right?

422
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,170
Because the i squared is
minus one, those cancel.

423
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:21,070
When those are equal
opposite signs.

424
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:29,490
And we get u_xx+u_yy equaling 0.

425
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,140
So that works.

426
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,490
And, actually, the same idea
would work for any function

427
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,000
of x+iy.

428
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,150
The two x derivatives
just give f''.

429
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:46,520
Two y derivatives will give f''
but the chain rule will bring

430
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,560
out i both times
and we've got it.

431
00:27:49,560 --> 00:28:00,640
OK, I think we just need
another couple of examples.

432
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,000
And this of course could
be in polar coordinates,

433
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,650
f of re^(i*theta).

434
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,220
That's just, everybody
recognizes re^(i*theta) is

435
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,760
the same as x+iy?

436
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,610
Better just be sure
we've got that. x is

437
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:23,160
some point here in the complex
plane. iy takes us up to here.

438
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,080
So there's x+iy.

439
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,090
That's x+iy there,
but it's also--

440
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,370
So let me put those in better.

441
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:37,120
So there's x and there's y.

442
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,230
Everybody knows
this picture, right?

443
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,260
This x and this y, now if I
want to go to polar coordinates,

444
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,770
that angle is theta,
this x is r*cos(theta),

445
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:55,320
this y is r*sin(theta), and
this guy is re^(i*theta).

446
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:55,910
re^(i*theta).

447
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,380


448
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:05,640
r*cos(theta) plus i*r*sin(theta)
is the same as re^i*theta.

449
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,830
That's utterly fundamental.

450
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:12,750
Everybody's responsible
for that picture

451
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:18,140
of putting the complex numbers
into their beautiful polar

452
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,640
form.

453
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,950
That's what made our r to the
nth cos(n*theta) all so simple.

454
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:30,230
Now, what was I aiming to do?

455
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,160
Give a particular f.

456
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:38,750
Now I want to give a
particular function f, or maybe

457
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,620
a couple of choices.

458
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,100
A couple of functions f, and
see that their real parts

459
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:50,090
and their imaginary parts
solve Laplace's equation.

460
00:29:50,090 --> 00:30:00,460
Let me take first a one
that works completely.

461
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,520
Take the real part and
the imaginary part--

462
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,380
Let me take e^(x+iy).

463
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,980


464
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,240
It's a function of x+iy,
extremely nice function

465
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,210
of x+iy, and we can figure out
its real and imaginary parts,

466
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:25,130
and we get two solutions
to Laplace's equation.

467
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:31,320
The good way is to write this
thing as e^x times e^(iy).

468
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:39,140
And again we'll write it as
e^x times cos(y)+i*sin(y).

469
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,750
So now I can see
that the real part--

470
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,100
I can see what the
real part is, and I can

471
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,830
see what the imaginary part is.

472
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,060
The real part will
be, that's real.

473
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:54,930
And that's real. so this
will so give me e^x*cos(y).

474
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:59,120
And the imaginary part
will be e^x*sin(y).

475
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,080
You see it.

476
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,080
And those will solve
Laplace's equation.

477
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,970
Can I give a name to this
whole field of analysis?

478
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:20,430
This e^z is an analytic -- I
should just use that word --

479
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:25,110
an analytic function.

480
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,830
And these guys, the real
and imaginary parts,

481
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:34,700
are two harmonic functions.

482
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,550
Maybe it's not so important
to know the word harmonic

483
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,360
function.

484
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,670
But analytic function,
yeah, I would

485
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,860
say that's an important word.

486
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,070
Actually, what does it mean?

487
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:52,480
It's a function of z.

488
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,900
So we're in the
complex plane here now.

489
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:04,570
It's a function of z, e^z, and
it can be written as a power

490
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:09,930
series, of course, one plus
z plus 1 over 2 factorial z

491
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,210
squared and all those guys.

492
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,080
So it has a power series.

493
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,450
That makes it a combination
of our special ones.

494
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:25,700
The great thing about that
series is it converges.

495
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,470
So an analytic function,
an analytic function

496
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:34,290
is the sum of a power
series that converges.

497
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,540
And this one does.

498
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,340
So there's an example.

499
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,530
Yeah, so the whole theory
of analytic functions

500
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:44,710
is actually, that's
Chapter 5 of the textbook.

501
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:53,490
And we won't get beyond this
point, I think, in one semester

502
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:57,280
with analytic functions.

503
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,000
So what am I saying, though?

504
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,020
I'm saying that the theory
of analytic functions

505
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,300
is closely tied to
Laplace's equation.

506
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,090
Because the real and
the imaginary parts

507
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:13,110
give me this pair u and s that
satisfy, they each satisfy

508
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,870
Laplace's equation.

509
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:19,510
And they're connected by the
Cauchy-Riemann equations.

510
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:25,280
Boy, it's a lot of mathematics
coming real fast here.

511
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,130
Now I'd like to take
one more example.

512
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:33,600
Instead of the exponential,
can we take the logarithm.

513
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,820
I want to take the log of x+iy,
and I want you to split it

514
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,120
into its real and
imaginary parts,

515
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,180
and get the u and the
s that go with that.

516
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,810
So this was like
the nicest possible.

517
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,780
We got a series of, e^z
is good for every z,

518
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,540
the series converges, fantastic.

519
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,990
It's an analytic
function everywhere.

520
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,440
Best possible.

521
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,380
Now we go to one that's not
best possible but nevertheless

522
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,340
highly valuable.

523
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,620
OK, so e^z, I've done.

524
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:17,590
Let me erase e^z, take log z.

525
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:23,760
OK, so now I'm not
doing e^z any more.

526
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,425
And I want to find
the logarithm, OK.

527
00:34:28,425 --> 00:34:30,050
So, what's the deal
with the logarithm?

528
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,550
Real and imaginary parts.

529
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:42,450
Now I'm going to
take the log of x+iy.

530
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:50,570
That is a function of x+iy,
except at one point it has

531
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,910
a problem, right?

532
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:57,970
There's a point where this
is not going to be analytic,

533
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:06,130
and there's going to be a
special point in the flow which

534
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,840
is singular somehow.

535
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,090
But away from that point, we
have a nice-looking function,

536
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:17,480
the logarithm of x+iy, and
now I'd like to get its real

537
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,040
and imaginary parts.

538
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,050
I'd like to know
the u and the s.

539
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,900
But nobody in their
right mind wants

540
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,690
to take the logarithm
of a sum, right?

541
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:32,350
That's a very foolish thing to
try to do, the log of a sum.

542
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:35,590
What's the good way to
get somewhere with this?

543
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:39,140
Real and imaginary part.

544
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:44,560
I can take the log of a product.

545
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,000
So the polar is
way better again.

546
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,230
I want to write this as
a log of r e to the-- I

547
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,180
want to write it that way.

548
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:00,870
And now what's the
log of a product?

549
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,310
The sum of the two pieces.

550
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:13,060
So I have log r, and the log
of e^(i*theta), which is?

551
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,230
Which is i*theta.

552
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,690
Boy, look, this is fantastic.

553
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,330
Fantastic except at zero.

554
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:27,160
I mean, it's fantastic but
it's got a big problem at zero.

555
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,890
But it's an extremely
important example.

556
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,840
So what's the real part?

557
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,530
It's sitting there.

558
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,140
This is my u.

559
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,220
This is my u(r,theta), my
u(x,y), whatever you want,

560
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,820
is the log of r.

561
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:51,570
The log of the square root
of x squared plus y squared.

562
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:56,970
I claim that again by this
magic combination, this log,

563
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,680
this-- r is the square root
of x squared plus y squared.

564
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,520
I claim if you substitute
that into Laplace's equation

565
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,300
you get zero.

566
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,940
It works.

567
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,510
And what's the
imaginary part, the s?

568
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:18,340
The twin is the imaginary
part, which is theta.

569
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:23,170
Oh, what is theta in x,
if I wanted it in x and y?

570
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,860
What would theta be?

571
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,930
It's the arctan,
it's the angle whose

572
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:36,070
tangent is something. y/x,
so if I really want it

573
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:42,100
in rectangular xy stuff, it's
the angle whose tangent is y/x.

574
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,520
And again, if you
remember in calculus

575
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,860
how to take derivatives
of this thing

576
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,140
and you plug it into Laplace's
equation you get zero.

577
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,190
It works.

578
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:57,220
So that's a great
solution except where?

579
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,610
At zero.

580
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,520
Except at zero.

581
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:11,310
And this doesn't tell us
what's happening at zero.

582
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,280
It's an excellent solution.

583
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,230
What's the picture?

584
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:24,610
So by Wednesday's
exam I'm not expecting

585
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:30,070
you to be an expert on the
theory of analytic functions.

586
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:35,370
I don't expect you to know
any conformal mappings.

587
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:43,040
By Wednesday, God, that's-- But,
I do expect you to have these

588
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,680
pictures in mind.

589
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,465
So when I draw those
axes, what picture is it

590
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:50,950
that I'm planning on?

591
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,920
I'm planning on the
equipotentials u

592
00:38:52,920 --> 00:39:02,460
equal constant, and the,
who are the other guys?

593
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,900
The streamlines.

594
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,050
The places where the
stream functions-- So here

595
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,460
is the potential function.

596
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,980
So what are the
equipotential curves?

597
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,950
For that guy?

598
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,570
Circles.

599
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,200
This is a constant
when r is a constant,

600
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:28,980
so the equipotential
functions would be circles.

601
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,730
I don't want to draw that
circle with radius zero, though.

602
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,950
I'm nervous about that one.

603
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,000
But all the others are great.

604
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,430
And what are the
streamlines, now?

605
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:47,140
The streamlines are, well,
what will the streamlines be?

606
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,620
If I've drawn one family, you
can tell me the other family.

607
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,140
The streamlines will be?

608
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:57,170
Radial lines.

609
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,860
Because they're going to
be perpendicular to this.

610
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:06,680
And so what do I get, this is
the stream function, theta.

611
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,290
So what's a streamline?

612
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,740
The stream function
should be a constant.

613
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,140
Theta's a constant.

614
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,980
That means I'm
going out on rays.

615
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,930
Those are all streamlines.

616
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,570
Again, everything fantastic.

617
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,720
If you look in a
little region here

618
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,690
you see just a beautiful
picture of equipotentials

619
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,560
and streamlines crossing
them at right angles.

620
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,300
Everything great.

621
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,270
Just that point is
obviously a problem.

622
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:51,660
Now, and I'm suspecting
that there's a source here.

623
00:40:51,660 --> 00:41:00,000
I think this flow, which
is given by these guys,

624
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,400
comes from some kind of a
delta function right there.

625
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,260
And the flow goes outwards.

626
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,510
So I know u, I know v is
the gradient of u, right?

627
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,560
I could take the x
and y derivatives,

628
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,700
I'd know the velocity.

629
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,270
I know the stream function,
the divergence would be zero.

630
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:32,200
Everything great,
except at the origin.

631
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,430
I think we've got some
action at the origin.

632
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:43,460
Because, here's
the way to test it.

633
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:49,100
I want to see what's
happening at the origin.

634
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,150
And I'm going to use
the divergence theorem.

635
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,680
Yeah.

636
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,179
Yeah.

637
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,160
I'm going to use the
divergence theorem.

638
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,780
So the divergence theorem says--
What is the divergence theorem?

639
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:09,610
So this is the key thing that
connects double integrals.

640
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:14,230
Let me take a circle
of radius R. So

641
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:19,350
that's the circle of radius
R. R could be big, or little.

642
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,330
So I integrate
over the circle of

643
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:30,890
radius R. So what's the
deal? v is the same as w.

644
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,850
What does the divergence
theorem tell me?

645
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,860
It tells me that if I
integrate, what do I integrate,

646
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:43,210
the divergence of w?
dx/dy, or r*dr*d theta.

647
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,960


648
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:52,760
Then I get the flux.

649
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,450
So this is a key identity.

650
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,600
Fundamentally, more than
just the key identity,

651
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,320
it's central here.

652
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:07,650
The total flow out of
the region must make it

653
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,000
through the boundary.

654
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,460
So I integrate this
boundary, and this boundary

655
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,180
is a circle of radius
R, and what do I

656
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:19,390
integrate along that circle?

657
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:23,670
What's the other side of
the divergence theorem?

658
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:30,280
w dot n. w dot n,
around the boundary.

659
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:37,730
And remember, I have
this nice-- my curve here

660
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:42,450
is this nice circle.

661
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,600
So I'm going to integrate
around that circle.

662
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:52,130
First of all, what is n?

663
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,990
By definition, n is the
normal that points outward,

664
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,250
straight out.

665
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:02,520
So it's actually
going out that way.

666
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,540
At every point it's
pointing straight out.

667
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,130
And ds-- Yeah, I think
we can figure out exactly

668
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:18,420
what that right-hand side is.

669
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,090
How do I get that
right-hand side?

670
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:29,670
I'm looking for w, and
then I have to integrate.

671
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:35,580
OK, here is my u.

672
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:42,790
My u is log r.

673
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:45,520
So what's the gradient of log r?

674
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,690
It points outwards.

675
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,430
And how large is the derivative?

676
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:55,600
So the derivative of
this log r is 1/r.

677
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:03,400
I think that this comes down
to, this is the integral.

678
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,010
Around the circle.

679
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:14,930
I think that this thing is 1/R.
I went pretty quickly there,

680
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:17,960
so I'll ask you to
look in the book

681
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,360
because this is such an
important example it's

682
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,150
done there in more detail.

683
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:30,080
So I'm claiming that
the derivative is 1/R,

684
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,780
and that it points directly out.

685
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:35,930
So the gradient points out.

686
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:40,700
The normal points out, so that
I just get exactly 1/R. Now,

687
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,470
what is ds?

688
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:45,300


689
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,840
For integrating
around the circle

690
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:54,410
what's a little tiny
piece of arc on a circle?

691
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,260
Of radius R?

692
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,050
R d theta.

693
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:57,830
Good man.

694
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:03,120
R d theta.

695
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:09,150
Now that's an integral
I can do, right?

696
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,200
And what do I get?

697
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,630
2 pi.

698
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:19,730
R cancels R, I'm integrating d
theta around from zero to 2pi.

699
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:20,620
The answer is 2pi.

700
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,160


701
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,530
So what do I learn from that?

702
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:35,700
I learn that somehow this source
in the inside has strength 2pi.

703
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:42,120
What's sitting in there is
2pi times a delta function.

704
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:47,910
This is the solution
to Laplace's equation

705
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,770
except at that source
term, so I really

706
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:53,710
should say Poisson's equation.

707
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,250
This has turned out
to be the solution

708
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:03,580
to Poisson with a delta,
or with 2pi times a delta.

709
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:08,990
We have just solved
this important equation.

710
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:12,690
Poisson's equation
with a point source.

711
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:16,160
And, of course, that's
important because when

712
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,900
you can solve with
a point source,

713
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,650
you can put together
all sorts of sources.

714
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,790
And this is called
the Green's function.

715
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,800
The Green's function
is the solution

716
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,540
when the source is a delta.

717
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:33,740
So if I divide by
2pi, now I've got it.

718
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:37,920
I divide this by 2pi and
there is the Green's function.

719
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,070
I have to put that
in bold letters.

720
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:48,220
Green's function.

721
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,130
It's the solution
to the equation when

722
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,530
the source is a
delta and the answer

723
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:59,870
is u is the log of r over 2pi.

724
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:06,460
So that's the Green's
function in 2-D. Physicists,

725
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:10,320
you know, they live and die
with these Green's function.

726
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,510
Live, let's say, with
Green's function.

727
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:18,700
And they would want to know
the Green's function in 3-D.

728
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,590
So the Green's function
in three dimensions

729
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:23,400
also turns out beautifully.

730
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:28,110
This is in, they would
say, in free space.

731
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:32,170
This is the Green's function
when there's no other charges.

732
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:36,940
Nothing is happening, except for
the charge right at the center.

733
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:44,510
And if I'm in two dimensions the
Green's function is this log r.

734
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:49,360
So it grows more slowly.

735
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,550
It behaves like log r.

736
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:56,670
And in 3-D I think the
answer is 1/(4pi*r).

737
00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:02,260
It's just amazing that
those Green's functions,

738
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:09,730
when the right side is a
delta, have such nice formulas.

739
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:16,280
OK, let me take one moment here.

740
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:22,080
I'll tell you what
conformal mapping is about.

741
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,300
But what's your take-home
from this lecture?

742
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:32,530
Your take-home is two
methods that we can really

743
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:35,530
use to get a formula
for the answer.

744
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:43,400
One method was for Laplace's
equation in a circle.

745
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,840
Get the boundary conditions in
a series of sines and cosines,

746
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,420
and then just put in
the r's that we need.

747
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,000
That's a simple, simple method.

748
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,520
Provided we can get started
with the Fourier series.

749
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,480
The second method is,
look at functions of x+iy,

750
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,270
and try to pick one that
matches your problem.

751
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:14,830
And if your problem has a
point source, at the origin,

752
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:17,300
we found the one.

753
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,350
So the literature
for hundreds of years

754
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,730
is aimed at solving
other problems.

755
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,350
If the point source is
somewhere else, what happens?

756
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,980
That's not hard.

757
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,440
If it's not a point source
but some other kind of source,

758
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:37,770
or if the region
is not a circle.

759
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:42,110
Can I say in one final
sentence just what to do,

760
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:46,820
this conformal mapping
idea, when the region is not

761
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,010
a circle.

762
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:54,380
Well, I can say it in one
word, make it a circle.

763
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,860
I mean, that's what Riemann
said, you could do it.

764
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:02,410
You could think of a
function, so Riemann said that

765
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:05,820
there's always some
function of x+iy,

766
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:10,210
let me call this Riemann's
function capital F of x, y.

767
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:13,770
So this is now the idea
of conformal mapping.

768
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,700
Change variables.

769
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,640
Conformal mapping is
a change of variables.

770
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:24,530
He picked some function and
let its real part be X and let

771
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:29,670
its imaginary part
be Y. Capital Y. OK,

772
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:33,110
this is totally ridiculous
to put conformal mapping

773
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,970
in 30 seconds.

774
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:42,070
But, never mind,
let's just do it.

775
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,490
The book describes
conformal mappings

776
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:49,360
and classical applied
math courses do much more

777
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,290
with conformal mapping.

778
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:54,180
But the truth is,
computationally

779
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:59,130
they're not anything like
as much used as these.

780
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,460
So what's the idea?

781
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:05,400
The idea is to find a
neat function of x+iy,

782
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:11,620
so that your crazy
boundary becomes a circle.

783
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,110
In the capital X,
capital Y variables.

784
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:19,030
So you're mapping
the region, ellipse,

785
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:23,310
whatever it looks like,
by changing from little x,

786
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:27,540
little y, where it was an
ellipse, to capital X, capital

787
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,350
Y, where it's a circle.

788
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,960
And the point is
Laplace's equation

789
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,740
stays Laplace's equation.

790
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:37,490
That change of variables does
not mess up Laplace's equation.

791
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:40,710
So that then you've
got it in a circle.

792
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:44,010
You solve it in a
circle, for these guys.

793
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:46,060
And then you go back.

794
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:51,210
In a word, you're able to solve
Laplace's equation in this

795
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:57,880
crazy region because you
never leave the magic x+iy.

796
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:02,360
You find a combination with
that magic x+iy that makes

797
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,310
your region into a circle.

798
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:10,710
In the circle we now know how
to use capital X plus i capital

799
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:15,110
Y. You're staying with
that magic combination

800
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,090
and getting the region
to be what you like.

801
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:21,540
So people know a lot of
these conformal mappings.

802
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,810
A famous one is
the Joukowski one,

803
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:31,160
that takes something that
looks very like an airfoil,

804
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,910
and you can get a
circle out of it.

805
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:37,890
So I'll put down
Joukowski's name.

806
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:48,950
So that's one that I trust
Course 16 still finds valuable.

807
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:55,780
It's a transformation
that takes certain shapes

808
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,390
and they include shapes
that look like airfoils,

809
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:00,240
and produce circles.

810
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:07,740
OK, so sorry about such a
quick presentation of such a

811
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,080
basic subject.

812
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:15,120
Conformal mapping, not on any
exam, that'd be impossible.

813
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,250
It's really this stuff that
you're number one responsible

814
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,293
for.

815
00:54:20,293 --> 00:54:20,793
