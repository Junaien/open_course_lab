8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,700
PROFESSOR STRANG: Okay, shall
we start on this review session?

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,360
And I'm figuring that the main
topic would be finite elements,

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,840
because the last review session
focused on the truss problems.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,850
One note about codes.

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:43,920
So probably you've looked
at the CSE page, where

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,270
some codes that we had
earlier are put there,

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,270
section by section.

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,630
Now people are
contributing a truss code,

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,640
so I don't see any reason
why that shouldn't eventually

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,960
go onto the CSE page.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,450
If you have other codes,
like finite element

19
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,570
codes, for specific
problems, think about,

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,630
if you get them
with some comments,

21
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,210
if they're appropriate
to go on the CSE page,

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,730
that's certainly a possibility.

23
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,260
And the homework
solutions, which

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:28,750
are now on the 18.085 page,
will migrate to the CSE page,

25
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,710
for their permanent status.

26
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,480
So that's just to say, this
is a page that's growing,

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,450
and any help is
very, very welcome.

28
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,170
So, I'm ready for questions
about finite elements, maybe

29
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,770
specifically, or
other things, too.

30
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,940
Thanks.

31
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,620
Yeah, lots to say
about finite elements.

32
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,120
Yeah?

33
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,887
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

34
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:00,720
PROFESSOR STRANG: So
this is finite elements

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,010
for heat transfer.

36
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,770
Okay, which course was that?

37
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,170
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

38
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,350
PROFESSOR STRANG: Okay.

39
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,310
Right, free or fixed
boundary conditions.

40
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,850
Okay, I see.

41
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,520
So the question is, how do
we handle boundary conditions

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,400
which are not
something equal zero,

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,390
but something equals a
constant, or something is given.

44
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,890
Right.

45
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,560
Good point.

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,720
So, somehow when
we're given numbers,

47
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,180
they're going to--
Input, source terms,

48
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,740
they're going to show up
on the right-hand side.

49
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,400
Right?

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,930
Eventually, they'll be part
of the right side vector F,

51
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,320
in some appropriate way.

52
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,680
So that we'll be solving
KU=F, where U will represent

53
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,900
the unknown displacements,
whatever they are

54
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,160
in the problem.

55
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:23,150
So let's see, what do I say
about getting things correctly

56
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,720
onto the right hand side?

57
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,660
My general thought would
be, so we create a matrix

58
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,120
that I might call K_0.

59
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,030
That's a matrix where
we have not knocked

60
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,640
out any rows or columns.

61
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,300
It's probably, almost
surely singular.

62
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:51,850
It's got all possible
unknowns, even those that

63
00:03:51,850 --> 00:04:02,030
are not actually unknown,
associated with the columns

64
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,080
of that matrix.

65
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,150
So we start with that.

66
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,010
Start with that.

67
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,250
Okay.

68
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:14,940
Now, suppose-- Let's take
things in order then.

69
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,800
Suppose U_7 is set to zero.

70
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,620
So what will that
do to our matrix K?

71
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,150
How do we-- Having
created this matrix K,

72
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,970
let's suppose we've got
it, how do we include in it

73
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,890
the boundary condition U_7=0?

74
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:41,120
Okay, well that column of
the matrix, the column number

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,600
seven, I guess, or the column
corresponding to that unknown,

76
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,880
is going to go.

77
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,420
Is that right?

78
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,200
Yes.

79
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,860
That's what we've done,
we've struck out a column.

80
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,560
And we should also, I
guess, strike out a row.

81
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,660
We would really like to end up
with symmetric, and normally

82
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,780
positive definite, matrices.

83
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,950
So this would be a column
row-- I'm speaking roughly,

84
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,350
because I didn't have advanced
preparation on this question.

85
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,440
So column/row removed.

86
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,100
Okay, now suppose
U_7 has some value

87
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,670
A. How do we account for that?

88
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,740
So what do we do?

89
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:39,200
U_7 isn't still unknown, so
we want to get that column out

90
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,620
of our matrix.

91
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,120
But something has to happen
to account for the A.

92
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,050
So what is that?

93
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:56,260
So my picture is that in my
original K_0, which had--

94
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:03,550
My original K_0, and then all
the U's equal all the F's.

95
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:14,040
So this had a column for
everybody, including U_7.

96
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,420
So there was the other
U's, including U_7,

97
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:26,070
and these F's maybe came
from body forces, stuff

98
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,620
inside the interval.

99
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,790
Now here comes perhaps
a boundary condition.

100
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,100
Oh, I wrote it in
the middle anyway.

101
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,340
So what happens
when I set U_7 to A?

102
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,160
So I think that becomes,
I strike out that unknown,

103
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,060
strike out that column,
strike out that row, I think.

104
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,130
But what should happen?

105
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,750
How does the A come in?

106
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,880
Well that A multiplied
that column, right?

107
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,640
That A multiplied-- This
equation expressed equilibrium.

108
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:06,110
Those equations were all valid.

109
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,380
You could say we haven't imposed
the boundary conditions yet.

110
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,880
Now when we do-- So that
A multiplies that column.

111
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,720
So what happens now, what
do you think should I do?

112
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,620
It seems to me that I should
bring A times that column over

113
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,330
to the other side, with
a minus, of course,

114
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,120
because I put it on the
other side of the equation.

115
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:37,140
So I would think I do
this: A times column seven.

116
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,450
I think.

117
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,120
I think that would seem right.

118
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,705
Now you're going to ask about --
you unfortunately did ask about

119
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:47,870
-- a free condition.

120
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:55,380
Say u'-- So what
am I going to do?

121
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,760
I'd better think here.

122
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,550
What's cooking now?

123
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:06,550
So I could prescribe u',
let me say one, equal zero,

124
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,710
let's just think about that.

125
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,400
What happens with that?

126
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,650
Hmm.

127
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,420
So let's see.

128
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:30,470
Well, so u' was
not one of our U's,

129
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,350
so this isn't just simply,
OK assign a value, zero or A,

130
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:42,430
to a U. u' being zero, well that
came in as a natural boundary

131
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,820
condition, right?

132
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,150
If I remember my own lectures.

133
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:52,620
So that u'=0 came in as a
natural boundary condition.

134
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,460
And what did that mean?

135
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:01,310
That meant that I don't
have to impose it.

136
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,960
The finite element method
should deal with that.

137
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,540
This is really our w.

138
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,390
Our dual unknown, w.

139
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,650
It's better to think of it as w.

140
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,930
Maybe cu' is what it is, but
it's good to think of it as w.

141
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,210
Okay, so I think of
that as something we

142
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,420
don't have to impose.

143
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,400
In other words, the
way I'm thinking now,

144
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,300
I don't have to
think about that.

145
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:40,100
I've got trial functions
whose combinations will get

146
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,660
me close to the correct answer.

147
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:51,970
And the equations will
naturally do that.

148
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:58,650
Okay, now you're asking
this serious question?

149
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,620
What about w=A?

150
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,130


151
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,000
What about that?

152
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,880
Or B. Let me make it
something different.

153
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,290
Okay.

154
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:22,770
Let me say right off, without
having prepared a good answer

155
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,490
to this question, I'm not going
to do it as well as I should.

156
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,790
So maybe what my real
answer should be,

157
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:37,040
let me think through the best
answer and do it another time.

158
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:48,660
It's going to contribute
some term, some new term.

159
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,460
When we integrated by parts
to get to the weak form,

160
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,630
this guy just showed up.

161
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,240
And up to now, we've just
assume that B was zero,

162
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,310
and we didn't worry.

163
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,890
But somewhere in that
integration by parts,

164
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,950
a term is going to appear
that I can't just throw away.

165
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:09,450
Yeah.

166
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,730
So let me think about
that more properly.

167
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,280
I mean that's a
very good question,

168
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,930
and the lectures
didn't allow for that.

169
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,330
Okay, if I can put that one
off and give you a good answer.

170
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,900
Because it deserves it.

171
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,910
Okay, other questions.

172
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,400
Other discussion.

173
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,192
Yeah, you have one?

174
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:30,858
AUDIENCE: I have maybe
a silly question.

175
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,041
PROFESSOR STRANG: You
have a silly question?

176
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:33,540
Good.

177
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,080
Okay.

178
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:43,042
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

179
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,750
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Compare finite elements

180
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,940
with finite differences.

181
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,790
Okay, yeah.

182
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:55,960
That's not a silly question.

183
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,790
So finite differences
is certainly

184
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,770
associated with
values at a mesh.

185
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,800
Here would be one
way to think of it.

186
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,340
So the question is,
finite elements,

187
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:13,160
finite element method versus
finite difference method.

188
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,610
And of course, there
are other methods, too.

189
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:25,710
Okay, I could think
about finite differences.

190
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:30,160
One way of seeing
them together is,

191
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,700
I could think about finite
differences this way.

192
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,480
My test functions, you
remember, which I always

193
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,010
integrate against.

194
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,060
Instead of taking
the test functions

195
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,380
to be the trial functions,
which is giving us

196
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:55,550
our standard finite element K,
I could take the test functions

197
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,230
to be delta functions.

198
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,810
What would happen
if I take the-- So,

199
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,420
again just think about that.

200
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:11,860
Suppose my solution U is
a combination of the phis,

201
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,180
as always.

202
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,630
As before.

203
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:32,380
But my test functions, V, are
delta functions at mesh points.

204
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,400
Because up to now,
we've always taking

205
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,280
the V's to be the
same as the phis.

206
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,930
So the V_i, the test functions,
and I'll want n of them.

207
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,300
I'll have n mesh points.

208
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,190
My n mesh points, those will
give me n delta functions,

209
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,810
n test functions.

210
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:58,050
And what happens then, when
I look at the integral?

211
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:08,030
The finite element deal
says, take the weak form.

212
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:12,770
Well, OK.

213
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,070
And you'll see why, I'm going
to take the weak form before I

214
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,480
take the integration by parts.

215
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,180
Why is that?

216
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,180
Because when I
integrated by parts,

217
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,050
do you remember
what the effect was?

218
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,620
The effect was to take
a derivative off of U

219
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,020
and throw it onto
the test function V.

220
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,640
But now that I'm choosing delta
functions for the V's, it's

221
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,800
too risky.

222
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,850
I don't want a derivative
of a delta function.

223
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,660
I better keep it all over here.

224
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:53,340
So I'll have -cU'', times V.
This is what I had originally.

225
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,560
I just took the
equation, you remember

226
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,110
how we got these equations?

227
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:05,270
I just took the strong form,
multiplied by V, integrated,

228
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,840
and now I usually
integrated by parts,

229
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,680
but I'm backing off of that.

230
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:20,280
Because my V is too
singular to do it.

231
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,890
So again, what would I do?

232
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:28,210
My U would be a combination,
as always, of these.

233
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,710
And what will I get
for these integrals?

234
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,800
What will I get for
those integrals?

235
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,500
Well, of course, if
that's a delta function

236
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,390
at a mesh point, when
I integrate something

237
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,420
against a delta
function, I get--

238
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,290
What do I get when I integrate
against a delta function?

239
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:55,360
If V_i is the delta function
at a particular mesh point i,

240
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,170
as always I get the
value of that at i.

241
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,340
At i.

242
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:06,950
So I'll get -cU'' will
be whatever it is.

243
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,790
It will be the sum of
U_i's, the unknown constant,

244
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,100
times the phi_i double prime.

245
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,500


246
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,660
And what will I get on
the right-hand side?

247
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,690
When I integrate f times V_i?

248
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,280
I'll get f at that
mesh point, f_i.

249
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:34,240
In other words, I think what
I've got there is essentially

250
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,720
a difference equation.

251
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,280
I'm back pretty much
to finite differences.

252
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,680
I'm taking the value f, not
integrated now, but just

253
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,740
its value at i,
because that's what I

254
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,050
get when I do a delta function.

255
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,160
And I'm taking this.

256
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,970
Notice, a lot of things
are different here.

257
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,290
And there's a name for this.

258
00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:00,760
This is called collocation.

259
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,680
I guess what I'm saying
is collocation, this idea,

260
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,620
is somewhere in between.

261
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:17,290
I'm interpolating -- collocation
-- between the finite element,

262
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,040
the Galerkin principle,
and finite differences,

263
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,600
where I don't even think
about trial functions.

264
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,320
In between is something
that really looks like--

265
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:35,900
[SOFT MUSIC] [LAUGHTER] I don't
know if that wonderful music

266
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,750
comes through on the
OpenCourseWare tape,

267
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,310
but anyway.

268
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,360
This is MIT.

269
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,700
We get a brass band here.

270
00:17:45,700 --> 00:18:04,500
Okay, that would be a very
finite-difference-looking set

271
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,450
of equations to approximate the
original differential equation.

272
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,640
The point I want to
make, this gives me

273
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,630
a chance to make a point here.

274
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,410
Could I use hat functions?

275
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:25,100
Could I use hat functions in
this as my trial functions,

276
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,310
if I was not going to
integrate by parts?

277
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,360
When are hat functions allowed?

278
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,500
Because hat functions
have a jump in the slope.

279
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,750
Right?

280
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,220
Hat functions have
a jump in the slope.

281
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:42,210
Then my answer, you can
see it coming, is no.

282
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:47,620
Hat functions, they don't
have good second derivatives.

283
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,880
So I wanted to make that
point, also, for beam bending.

284
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,460
And let me make it.

285
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,270
So your question is
leading me to another topic

286
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:04,440
that I wanted to mention.

287
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:16,000
That hat functions, phi' is OK.

288
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,150
Phi double prime, second
derivatives of hat functions,

289
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:27,460
are basically, let me just
say it in a word, not OK.

290
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:33,910
So this is OK, this is for
second order equations.

291
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:38,460
Well, second order equations
have a second derivative.

292
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,310
Looking bad.

293
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:47,690
But when I integrate by parts--
After integration by parts.

294
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,460
And that's exactly
how we've used them.

295
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,020
We've used them for our
second order equation.

296
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,660
We integrated by parts.

297
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:03,030
We had terms like cu'--
c phi primes times V'.

298
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,350
First derivatives, no problem.

299
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:18,910
But not OK for
collocation, this method

300
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,710
that I've just spoken about.

301
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,200
Because we're not
integrating by parts.

302
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,290
Our test function V,
the delta, was not

303
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,900
smooth enough to move a
derivative over there.

304
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:38,280
And, now my additional
not OK, for bending.

305
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,640
So this is just bringing
us into today's lecture,

306
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,060
but maybe it completes a point.

307
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:52,390
So in bending we did
integrate by parts.

308
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,810
So what did we get?

309
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:01,750
Our bending weak form,
our fourth order equation

310
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,860
weak form.

311
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,000
Say u fourth
derivative equal f(x).

312
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,200
When I integrated
by parts twice,

313
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,070
you remember, I had
u fourth times a v,

314
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,070
times a test function, dx.

315
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,500
And my idea, so really
we're seeing it here

316
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,750
for the first time, was to
do two integrations by parts,

317
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:36,320
get two derivatives off
of u, put them onto v,

318
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,620
and maybe there's a
c(x) in here, too.

319
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:44,900
This was our
integral to be done.

320
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:51,390
That's the basic integral that
leads to all the entries of K.

321
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,120
But the trouble is-- So
that's in the bending problem.

322
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,050
In the fourth order
problem, our integrals

323
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,640
are going to look like that.

324
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,460
And we have to use functions
that are good enough.

325
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,270
So if I use hat functions,
they're not good enough.

326
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:07,890
Why's that?

327
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,380
If you suppose u
and v are the same,

328
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,980
then I'm integrating the
second derivative squared.

329
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,850
And what is the second
derivative, what's its square,

330
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,010
and what's the integral?

331
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:26,220
This is really
worth recognizing.

332
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:32,970
So suppose phi is the same as
v, and it's the hat function.

333
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,750
And if I want to
integrate some constant,

334
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:45,690
or some nice function times
phi'' times v'', what do I get?

335
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,660
What's the second derivative?

336
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,900
What's the first derivative
of my hat function?

337
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,790
It's up, right?

338
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,350
It's the first derivative.

339
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:01,830
So let me do phi'*v', is,
let me draw its graph.

340
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,850
The first derivative
is zero up to there,

341
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,690
then the first derivative
jumps up to something high,

342
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,000
up to the middle.

343
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,110
Then it drops to the negative.

344
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,800
And then it comes back to zero.

345
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,010
Right?

346
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,090
That's my first derivative.

347
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,510
I'm OK integrating that.

348
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,450
I'm OK squaring it
and integrating.

349
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,390
But the second derivative, if
I graph phi'', which will be

350
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,300
the same as v'', what's the
second derivative of that

351
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,160
function?

352
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,130
It's zero, and then what
is it at this point?

353
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,300
The derivative now?

354
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,520
Delta, right?

355
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,030
Spikes up.

356
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,280
Then nothing until this point.

357
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,900
At that point what happens?

358
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,730
Spikes down twice as far.

359
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,260
Really way down.

360
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,870
And then finally
there's a spike up.

361
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,610
Okay.

362
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,690
I can integrate spikes
times nice functions.

363
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,430
What I can't integrate
is a spike times a spike.

364
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,990
So the answer for
this integral is what?

365
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,220
It's infinite.

366
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,340
The integral is no good.

367
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:30,660
If I have a spike times a spike,
you see-- Delta functions,

368
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:41,930
I'm OK with a nice function,
f(x) times a delta, is OK.

369
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:48,910
But not OK for the integral of
delta of x times delta of x.

370
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,130
That's not OK.

371
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,660
That one is infinite.

372
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,640
That one is not in
our space of functions

373
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,140
that we can integrate.

374
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,640
OK.

375
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:10,460
So this is the difficulty
you meet with higher order

376
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,530
problems, is that
your functions, some

377
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:19,960
of the old functions that
worked fine, are no longer OK.

378
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,970
I need two derivatives.

379
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,990
Or I need to be
able to integrate

380
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,760
the second derivative squared.

381
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,020
It can have a jump, but
it can't have a spike.

382
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:41,700
So what functions
have we chosen?

383
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,740
How would we deal
with bending problems?

384
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,910
And I guess that'll probably
come, maybe quickly,

385
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,740
into Friday's lecture.

386
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,880
How would I do finite
elements for bending?

387
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:01,630
I'm not allowed to use
hats, so what will I use?

388
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,120
Do you remember that
construction, Monday?

389
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,030
Those cubics.

390
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:14,020
Remember those cubics, those
C^1 cubics would be OK.

391
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,800
Why's that?

392
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,060
Because they have a
continuous derivative.

393
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,710
They're one degree smoother
than hat functions.

394
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,640
These were C^0 hat functions.

395
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,300
And they were still C^0
when I put bubbles in there.

396
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:33,100
I had to get up to that
extra degree of smoothness,

397
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,680
this continuous slope.

398
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,880
Then I can take the
second derivative.

399
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,620
The second derivative
may have a jump.

400
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,200
Jumps are OK.

401
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,760
A jump in the second derivative
there and a jump there,

402
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,950
I can multiply two jump
functions and integrate.

403
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,550
So those C^1 cubics
that we constructed,

404
00:26:54,550 --> 00:27:00,060
you remember at every
node I had two unknowns,

405
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,190
the height and the slope.

406
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:05,880
So there were two cubics
for each mesh point.

407
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,590
But the key idea was that they
had this extra continuity.

408
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,820
And let me just
say, looking ahead,

409
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,230
these splines that
are also coming Friday

410
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,830
have one more degree of freedom.

411
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,670
I'm sorry, one
more, there's C^2.

412
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:31,030
So splines, cubic splines
-- I'll just put it here

413
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:41,480
because it fits -- C^2 for cubic
splines, that's coming Monday.

414
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,600
That's functions that have
two continuous derivatives,

415
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,000
and the jump is in
the third derivative.

416
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,130
So those could be
used, well, they

417
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,730
could be used for
sixth order problems.

418
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,870
Of course we're never going
to see a sixth order problem.

419
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,730
I hope.

420
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,630
But they could be used there.

421
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:04,645
Or they could be used in
collocation for fourth order--

422
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:06,770
Well, could they be used
for fourth order problems?

423
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,170
I'm not sure.

424
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:15,570
Anyway, the more smoothness,
as I go up in the derivatives,

425
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:22,290
I have to get more smoothness
in all the finite element

426
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,480
constructions.

427
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,630
And it gets a lot harder.

428
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,420
Actually, I can do it in 1-D,
but it gets seriously hard

429
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,410
in two dimensions to figure
out function surfaces

430
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,960
that-- This is what CAD
is all about, actually.

431
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,950
Is figuring out, how do
you get smooth surfaces?

432
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:48,990
The whole CAD/CAM world of NURBS
and piecewise, rational things.

433
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,030
It's a very complicated
construction,

434
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:57,060
to get the shape of
some engineering piece

435
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,040
approximated, including
its curved boundary,

436
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:07,330
by smooth piecewise polynomials,
or piecewise something.

437
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:14,500
That whole world of CAD is
not trivial, to do that.

438
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,330
Well, OK, that's my speech.

439
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,050
You got me started
with your question.

440
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,797
Did I answer your
question in some way?

441
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:23,880
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

442
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,838
PROFESSOR STRANG: It went
beyond your question.

443
00:29:25,838 --> 00:29:27,760
Yes it did.

444
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,610
That's right.

445
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:32,120
These are things
that I may not have

446
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,740
time to develop in
Friday's lecture,

447
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,180
because I really have to
get on to two dimensions,

448
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:44,190
and gradients and divergences,
all that good stuff

449
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,610
has to start Monday.

450
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,510
So we'll see something
about splines Friday.

451
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:56,250
But the whole world
of different elements

452
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,640
is sort of interesting.

453
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:04,380
Actually, can I say one more
thing about the elements

454
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,540
that we've already constructed.

455
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,330
I want to say one more
point that occurs to me.

456
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:17,490
And then I really will
stop and answer questions.

457
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,080
This extra point occurred to me.

458
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:28,070
You remember our example
where we had hat functions,

459
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:31,730
and then we also had
bubble functions.

460
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,690
Right?

461
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,180
So where did the bubble go?

462
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:44,390
These were only C^0, hats plus
bubbles, plus parabola bubbles,

463
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,560
quadratic bubbles.

464
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,900
Parabola bubble functions.

465
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,030
So how did those go?

466
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:59,455
Between two mesh
points-- Sorry, I'd

467
00:30:59,455 --> 00:31:05,960
better leave myself more
space for that bubble.

468
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,970
OK, so one of these
guys goes up, down.

469
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,150
One of these guys, another
hat goes up and down.

470
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:20,700
And then between two I threw
in a bubble function, like so.

471
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,760
Right?

472
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,110
So those were all in my list
of trial functions and test

473
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,240
functions.

474
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,860
Two kinds, hats and bubbles.

475
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,300
Now, that's all fine.

476
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,750
And we can do these integrals.

477
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:44,190
But one point I
sort of went past.

478
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:51,260
So let's call this phi left,
phi bubble, and phi right.

479
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,090
OK.

480
00:31:54,090 --> 00:32:00,050
So my trial functions, my
approximate solution, U,

481
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:05,380
is going to be some
amount of that left hat,

482
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:14,130
some amount of the bubble,
some amount of the right hat.

483
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:21,580
And more functions
on other intervals.

484
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,200
Now, my point is
just a simple one.

485
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:33,050
When we only had hats, then U
and the coefficient of this hat

486
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,600
was exactly the value
of U at that mesh point.

487
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,530
Why was that?

488
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:40,410
Because all the other
hats were zero there.

489
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:45,940
So when I only had hats,
these U's, U left and U right,

490
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:51,330
were exactly the values of my
approximation at the nodes.

491
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:55,430
That's why it looked so much
like finite differences.

492
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:01,220
What I want to ask you is, so
if I take the halfway point

493
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,660
as the sort of mesh
point for the bubble,

494
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,520
what is the value of
U of my approximation,

495
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,030
at that halfway point?

496
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,560
I just want to plug
in halfway point,

497
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,030
evaluate everything
at the halfway point.

498
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,800
So I want to find U
at this halfway point.

499
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,540
Right there.

500
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,900
Do you see what's happening?

501
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,860
U bubble, what is U
bubble, or phi bubble

502
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,140
at the halfway point?

503
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,260
One.

504
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,890
The bubble goes up to
one at the halfway point.

505
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,740
So the coefficient that
multiplies it multiplies one.

506
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,540
And you think, ah.

507
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,940
You might think, all
right, that's the value

508
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,910
of my approximation
at the halfway point.

509
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,660
But that's wrong, correct?

510
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,410
What is the value
of my approximation

511
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,370
at the halfway point, here?

512
00:33:56,370 --> 00:34:01,170
Well, this guy is not
zero at the halfway point.

513
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,790
This one is not zero.

514
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:08,030
This should have been R, sorry.

515
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,900
These hats are not zero there.

516
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,870
My basis is not
quite as beautiful.

517
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:19,690
It's not quite as beautiful,
because my trial functions

518
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,670
are not one trial
function per mesh point,

519
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:30,380
including halfway
points, as before.

520
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,290
No problem.

521
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:35,480
I can do all the integrals,
I can get the values,

522
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,240
I can solve KU=F to
find the weights.

523
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,520
And then I just have to remember
that my basis is not as perfect

524
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,840
as before, because
at that mesh point,

525
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,000
three functions
are contributing.

526
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,960
Probably I'm making this
sound like a big deal.

527
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,520
It isn't a big
deal, but you have

528
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,700
to remember that
that's the case,

529
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,680
that that coefficient
of the bubble

530
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,010
is not your solution
at that point.

531
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:08,180
You have to remember that the
left hat and the right hat

532
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:14,740
are also contributing
at that point.

533
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:21,930
Or I could rethink my
functions, and make them-- Now

534
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,060
that's the cool thing.

535
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,710
So that's the idea.

536
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:30,200
Just so you see that
I could do that.

537
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,250
Here is my left point,
here's my halfway point,

538
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,370
and here's my right point.

539
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:42,340
So I'm going to have the
same combinations, which

540
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:53,810
are the piecewise parabolas that
are continuous at the nodes.

541
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,220
Let me show it to you.

542
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,660
I could change from
hats and bubbles to,

543
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,370
I'll keep the bubble,
because that's

544
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,310
one at the halfway point.

545
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,200
That's good.

546
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,820
But I have to fix
those hat functions.

547
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:19,000
If I want the hat
functions to be focused--

548
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,330
If I want the phi left function,
I call that a hat function,

549
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:29,020
but it's going to change shape,
it won't be a conical hat.

550
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,480
If I want a phi
function, I want it

551
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,810
to be one at that point,
its own home point,

552
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,120
but what else do I want?

553
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,450
I want it to be zero there.

554
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,230
I don't want it to
contribute there,

555
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,220
if I want this perfection.

556
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,070
Or there.

557
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:52,460
So you see my hat, instead
of coming down like that

558
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:59,190
and being 1/2 at that
point, what shall I do?

559
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,060
I replace that hat
by some combination

560
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:08,470
of the hat and the bubble to
make a parabola that does that.

561
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:15,910
And of course, this other
way will be the same.

562
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,490
So that's not a hat anymore.

563
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,780
What name should I give it?

564
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,240
Anybody suggest a name?

565
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,611
It's sort of a hat.

566
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:27,110
Sombrero.

567
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:30,820
Sombrero. [LAUGHTER]
OK, so I now

568
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,270
have sombrero functions, right?

569
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:34,990
OK.

570
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,630
Good.

571
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,653
And there'll be a sombrero
function, instead of the hat,

572
00:37:40,653 --> 00:37:43,360
it was replaced by a better hat.

573
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,060
Now what about the one here?

574
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,680
Just tell me, how
do I draw that one?

575
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,890
What's that function?

576
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,970
I'll do it with dashed
lines, it's zero,

577
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:02,640
it should be zero at its
nodes-- at the nodes that

578
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,150
are not its nodes.

579
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:09,680
So you see each one is going
to come down and back up.

580
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,290
Really, I'm just saying you
have the freedom to do this.

581
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,410
By using combinations
of those functions,

582
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,780
I get exactly the
same as combinations

583
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,140
of these functions.

584
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:26,700
The only difference is that with
these new sombrero functions--

585
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:32,140
So now I have a U left sombrero
times a phi left sombrero,

586
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:36,570
and a U bubble times its
own bubble, I didn't change.

587
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:41,500
And a U right sombrero times
its phi right sombrero.

588
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,720
And the only point is that,
at that halfway point,

589
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,580
what does this equal
at the halfway point?

590
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,151
It equals that.

591
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:52,650
Right.

592
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:56,760
I've just done a little
change of variables.

593
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,940
I've changed the
function, so that

594
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:05,520
would change its coefficients,
but it's still the same space

595
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,480
of test functions.

596
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,360
I didn't change that.

597
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,390
My space of test
functions, these

598
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:15,350
are all still
piecewise parabolas.

599
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,360
They always were piecewise
parabolas, but some of them

600
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,040
were straight parabolas.

601
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,050
Now they're more
interesting parabolas.

602
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:31,200
OK, that may be a point you
didn't think about, anyway.

603
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:42,380
But it shows you that in
constructing finite elements,

604
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,760
it's really what
combinations you

605
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,730
get, more than what
individual hats or not,

606
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,810
or sombreros you might use.

607
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,950
In other words, you could
use either of those.

608
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,840
If you use the hat
functions, then you

609
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,600
could build on easy integrals.

610
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,710
Those integrals would be a
little trickier, not seriously.

611
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:13,530
And then the solution would be
like a finite difference thing.

612
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,690
Every U would link
to a mesh point.

613
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,330
OK.

614
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,650
I'll leave that
and hope you guys

615
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,240
have some questions
about homework.

616
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,740
Thanks.

617
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,950
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

618
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:30,410
PROFESSOR STRANG: Oh,
a question about this?

619
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:33,070
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

620
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:41,940
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah, when
I say better accuracy, when

621
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,900
I put the hats and
the bubbles together,

622
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,690
the improvement would
be noticed in between.

623
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,190
Yeah.

624
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:55,580
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

625
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,150
PROFESSOR STRANG:
These guys, you mean?

626
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,770
Well yeah.

627
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:01,160
I didn't change a thing.

628
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,630
The answer would
still be the same.

629
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,140
My capital U that would come
out would be no different.

630
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,730
It's just I've chosen
a different basis,

631
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,470
you could say, to represent it.

632
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,910
But there wouldn't
be any difference,

633
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:19,450
and it would still be-- So
what would be the accuracy now?

634
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,160
This is like a good review.

635
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,510
How close will U be
to the true solution?

636
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:30,100
Well, I've got up to
quadratic, second degree,

637
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,680
so I would expect h cubed error.

638
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,400
Because that's the
term I'm missing.

639
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,660
And that's the term that
the cubics would get.

640
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,710
Right.

641
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,670
Yes?

642
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:51,920
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
PROFESSOR STRANG:

643
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,120
The question is, why did
I pick-- So I had my hats.

644
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,430
I guess essentially,
I wanted to throw

645
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,430
in some additional
functions, the bubbles, that

646
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:10,470
would up the accuracy without
serious increase in work.

647
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:14,210
And the natural
construction was that one.

648
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:14,710
Yeah.

649
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:26,690
Then I got piecewise parabolas.

650
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,120
You look for a construction
of finite elements

651
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,210
that kind of comes out
neatly, and this one did.

652
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,370
There was another question.

653
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:40,682
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

654
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:42,890
PROFESSOR STRANG: Oh, these
parabolas would produce--

655
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,190
That's a good question.

656
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:47,530
Yeah, these parabolas would
produce a delta function

657
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:49,420
right there.

658
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,990
You see, they have
a jump in slope.

659
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:58,360
Even if they're parabolas,
they don't have smooth slope.

660
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:04,290
So this could not be used
for a bending problem.

661
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,020
Or let me say it a
little differently,

662
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,660
because people commit crimes.

663
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,490
I call them variational crimes.

664
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,497
People have tried.

665
00:43:14,497 --> 00:43:16,080
You know, it's a
heck of a lot of work

666
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,220
to construct smoother
trial functions.

667
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,900
So people say, well, just
ignore that delta function.

668
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,700
Put it in anyway, integrate
elsewhere, and just skip

669
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,920
the delta function.

670
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,610
So that would be called
a nonconforming function.

671
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:38,530
There's a very famous way to
create nonconforming function.

672
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,810
And that's very hot
stuff, actually.

673
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:48,680
Professor Peraire and others in
Aero are world experts on that.

674
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,790
Those are called
discontinuous Galerkin.

675
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,350
Discontinuous Galerkin.

676
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,300
This is fun.

677
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,290
You see what this
world is about.

678
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,910
So what's
discontinuous Galerkin?

679
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:07,590
Those will be ones where
there's a jump in the function.

680
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,210
Here I don't need
much space to show

681
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,150
you discontinuous Galerkin.

682
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,040
So there's a mesh point,
there's a mesh point.

683
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,560
Discontinuous Galerkin
might do this.

684
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,060
Oh no, not there.

685
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,140
That's continuous, sorry.

686
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:35,120
Discontinuous Galerkin would use
half hats inside the interval.

687
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,330
It would use that one.

688
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,100
And then another
one it would use

689
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,530
would be one that
jumped this way.

690
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:53,130
In other words, it sticks
within an interval,

691
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:58,910
it uses two functions
instead of one.

692
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:05,370
There are two unknowns.

693
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,460
Do you see what's happening now?

694
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:14,610
My space of trial functions
is going to have jumps.

695
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,650
Up to now, all my good hat--
my ordinary hat functions

696
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,950
were all continuous.

697
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,820
They were all C zero.

698
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:26,290
Now I'm dropping
back to C minus 1.

699
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,720
Somehow my functions have jumps.

700
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,600
So this is called DG,
discontinuous Galerkin.

701
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:39,340
And how could it be justified?

702
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,030
I mean, right?

703
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,500
These are functions--
Now I've got

704
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,710
a function that's not allowed
in my second order problem.

705
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:48,550
Right?

706
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:51,000
If I looked at my
list here, what was OK

707
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,710
and what was not OK, if I
look at interior half hats,

708
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:59,720
if I look at functions
that have a jump,

709
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,440
jump functions, shall
I say, jump functions.

710
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,740
Those would be C^(-1),
jump functions.

711
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:15,800
And phi' is not OK.

712
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:21,770
So I won't tell you, and I
wouldn't be able to do it well,

713
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:24,170
how do they rescue that?

714
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:28,220
However Professor Peraire
and others, others,

715
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:32,220
Professor Darmofal, a
whole group in Aero,

716
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:36,900
computing with functions
that have jumps.

717
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,050
And the way they
manage to do it is,

718
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,180
they have to add some
penalty term that

719
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,300
penalizes the jumps,
that controls the jumps.

720
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,650
If they just took
the standard set up,

721
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,540
as we have, and tried
their functions,

722
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,490
it would fail completely.

723
00:46:54,490 --> 00:47:00,570
So they adjust the
energy to penalize jumps.

724
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:04,450
Anyway, somebody
might sometime end up

725
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:09,160
working on some
project with them,

726
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:14,160
and DG would be very possible.

727
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,000
So you didn't ask me about
any homework problems yet.

728
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,180
Last chance.

729
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,260
Anything to ask about?

730
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,660
You got a lecture about
crazy stuff today.

731
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:31,340
Sorry about that, in a way,
but I hope it was all right.

732
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:41,180
So homework is now posted,
with a MATLAB question using

733
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:44,570
the elements that we've talked
about and some questions

734
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,100
from the text.

735
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,850
And don't forget, then,
my original comment

736
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:54,830
that if we end up with some
good codes for CSE that

737
00:47:54,830 --> 00:48:00,531
could be used by other people,
I'm very grateful to get them.

738
00:48:00,531 --> 00:48:01,030
OK.

739
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:05,450
Let's end today a little
early, and I'll see you Friday

740
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,587
for splines.

741
00:48:06,587 --> 00:48:07,087
