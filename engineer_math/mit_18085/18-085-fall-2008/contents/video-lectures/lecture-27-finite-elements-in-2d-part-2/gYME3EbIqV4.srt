00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,330
PROFESSOR STRANG: So,
let's see, you probably

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:31,880
guessed on that quiz problem
three, it wasn't what I meant.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,680
I get a zero for that problem.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,550
But you'll get
probably good numbers,

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,720
so that's an election gift
if it comes out that way.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,130
So they're all in the hands
of the TAs to be graded.

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,560
We have a holiday
Monday, I think.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,910
We come back to Fourier.

17
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,700
Now, so we just have a
concentrated shot at Fourier,

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,550
just about eight or nine
lectures in November.

19
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,990
So stay with it and
that'll be of course

20
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,700
the subject of the third quiz.

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,290
Which will have no mistakes.

22
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,660
It'll be solved by the TAs in
advance and we'll spot things.

23
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,090
So, and if we have the quizzes
to return to you by Wednesday

24
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,030
that will be great.

25
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:26,810
I hope so, but they
have a big job.

26
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,650
A little bit, looking far
ahead, the end of Fourier,

27
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:35,210
the quiz is December 4th,
I think that's a Thursday.

28
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,420
And that's the
end of the course.

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,440
So December 4th.

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,940
So we'll be ending the
course a little bit early.

31
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:52,130
Because I'll be in Hong
Kong, to tell the truth.

32
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,960
And and we've done a lot,
and with the review sessions

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,890
we're really doing well.

34
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:04,740
So, that's the future, Fourier.

35
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,900
Today is an important day
too, finite elements in 2-D,

36
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,180
that's a major part of
computational science

37
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,880
and engineering.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,660
The finite element idea, the
idea of using polynomials,

39
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,620
you can find in
some early papers

40
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,940
by Courant, a
mathematician in New York,

41
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:34,890
and by a guy in China,
neat guy named Feng Kang.

42
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,610
But those papers
were sort of, you

43
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,440
could do it this
way if you wanted.

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,110
It was really the structural
engineers in Berkeley

45
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,910
and elsewhere who made it
happen ten years later.

46
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,570
And the whole idea
has just blossomed.

47
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,470
Continues to grow.

48
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,190
So I had an early
book, in the '70s,

49
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:08,900
actually, about the mathematical
underpinnings, the math basis

50
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,460
for the finite element method.

51
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,500
And many other finite
element books have come.

52
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,520
Professor Bathe you know,
teaches a full of course

53
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,460
on that.

54
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,090
But, I think we can get the
idea of finite elements here.

55
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,350
We did them in 1-D, and now
there's a MATLAB problem

56
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,960
and I'd like to just describe
that particular problem

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,530
if I can, as an example.

58
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,600
And, of course, you
would use the code

59
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,510
that's printed in the book, and
that's available on the website

60
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,850
just to download.

61
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,030
But the problem is not
on a square domain.

62
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,570
It starts on a circle, so that
the first lines of the code,

63
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:09,160
calling the MATLAB command
squaregrid, are not applicable.

64
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,570
So you have to
create, then, a mesh.

65
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,810
Well, I have a suggested
mesh so I'll draw that,

66
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,480
and then from that
you want to make

67
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,020
a list of all the node points.

68
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:32,750
A list, P, of-- So what the
code needs is two lists.

69
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:39,680
Well, let me draw a picture
of, well, it's a circle.

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,100
And I'm going to be
solving Poisson's equation.

71
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:51,360
The equation will be
-u_xx-u_yy=4, in the circle.

72
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,350
So it's Poisson but with a
constant right-hand side.

73
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,310
That will mean that
all the integrals of f

74
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:04,870
times v, the right-hand side of
our discrete equation will be,

75
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,500
the integrals are all easy
because we just have a constant

76
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,670
there times the trial function.

77
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,170
OK, and then on the boundary
it's going to be u=0.

78
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,740
On the boundary.

79
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,810
So it's a classic problem.

80
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,020
And we can say what
the solution is.

81
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,700
So it's one with
a known solution.

82
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,020
I think it would be
x squared-- No, I

83
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,020
guess one, one minus x
squared minus y squared.

84
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,440
This should all be
on the .086 site.

85
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,970
I just didn't have a
chance to look this morning

86
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,700
to be sure it got up.

87
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,380
So you can watch, here.

88
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,940
So that, I hope, does
solve the problem.

89
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,160
Two x derivatives give us a two,
two y derivatives another two,

90
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,430
so we get four.

91
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,700
So we know the answer;
the question is,

92
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:00,110
and I'm interested in this
question, for research reasons

93
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:10,250
too, is what's the error
when you go to a polygon?

94
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,680
You go to a-- These
curved boundaries

95
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,750
don't get correctly saved.

96
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,520
You approximate them
by straight lines.

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,430
That would be the first idea.

98
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,610
And with this,
all this symmetry,

99
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,250
let's keep the problem nice
and use a regular polygon.

100
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,060
So maybe I'll try to draw
one with about eight sides,

101
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,530
but-- OK.

102
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:45,580
So we impose u=0 at these nodes.

103
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,870
So u is zero at those nodes,
and then we have a mesh.

104
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,000
So we want to create a mesh.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,420
OK, so with all
the symmetry here,

106
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:09,980
the natural idea would be to
start with eight pieces, or M

107
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,650
pieces if I have, this
is a regular M side,

108
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:19,800
let's say, and I'll take M
to be eight in this picture.

109
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,990
And I think we can work
on just one triangle.

110
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,130
By rotational symmetry,
all those triangles

111
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,520
are going to be the same.

112
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,070
So I think our domain is
really this one triangle here.

113
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,460
That's where we're working.

114
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:43,200
And in that triangle, I think we
have zero boundary conditions.

115
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:50,970
And across this edge I think
we have natural boundary

116
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,620
conditions.

117
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,420
Slope zero, if I see
the picture correctly.

118
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,900
The rotational
symmetry would mean

119
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,600
that things are not changing.

120
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,450
That every triangle is the same.

121
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,010
So I think on these boundaries
it's the Neumann condition,

122
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,510
dU/dn=0.

123
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,490


124
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,050
And I'm frankly not sure
what to do at the origin,

125
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,410
so I'll maybe just
try both ways and see.

126
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,790
OK, so there is a real problem.

127
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,830
Of course, it's
artificial in the sense

128
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,300
that we know the answer.

129
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:34,720
But it's a real open question of
what does the error look like,

130
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,480
from doing that.

131
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,790
So that's the goal
and let me just

132
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:42,340
say the problem
I'll ask you to do,

133
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:47,910
and it probably is quite enough
to be ready for next Friday,

134
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,320
is to use piecewise
linear elements.

135
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,470
Which is what I'm going to do.

136
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,010
What every discussion of finite
elements will begin with,

137
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:00,910
linear elements.

138
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:06,790
Those pyramids that I spoke
about at the end of last time.

139
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,040
So that's what I
hope, but actually I

140
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,570
would be highly interested, if
anybody got into the problem,

141
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,990
to try quadratic elements.

142
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:25,920
So I'll just say here,
second-degree quadratic

143
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:34,100
polynomials would
be more accurate.

144
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,830
Would be more accurate.

145
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:42,670
So, in other words,
this is a first type

146
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,120
of finite element called P_1,
for polynomials of degree one.

147
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,990
These guys, I would call P_2,
for polynomials of degree two.

148
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:59,280
And I've mentioned here the
possibility of using quads.

149
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,270
Instead of triangles, if
I had squares for example,

150
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,380
the simplest element
would be a Q_1.

151
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,540
So these are-- If I
manage today to tell you

152
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:19,050
about how to use P_1 and P_2
and Q_1, you're on your way.

153
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,190
And for the requirements
of this course,

154
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,410
P_1 is the first
point to understand.

155
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,430
OK.

156
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,810
While I'm speaking
about codes and meshes,

157
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:38,310
let me draw the mesh I proposed
in the homework problem.

158
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,860
So I thought OK, we just have
to have a simple mesh here.

159
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,180
So let me draw that line in.

160
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,840
I know all these points, right?

161
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,300
This is (0, 0) here.

162
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,800
And that point's on the circle.

163
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:04,120
And so is this, that point might
be, so what's the angle there?

164
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,330
That angle is probably pi/8.

165
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,670
The whole angle would be
2pi/8, and eight of them

166
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,470
would go all the way around.

167
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,460
So I think that angle is pi/8.

168
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,180
And so this point would
be (cos(pi/8), sin(pi/8)).

169
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:29,790
We know where they are.

170
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,470
But that's going to be
what we have to list.

171
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,090
We have to list where are the
coordinates of all the mesh

172
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:35,800
points.

173
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,490
So let me describe the
rest of the mesh points

174
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,440
and then see what that
list would look like.

175
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:51,070
And once you've created the
list, the code will take over.

176
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:55,960
And then you plot the results
and see what's going on.

177
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,980
So let me suggest a mesh.

178
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,800
It's pretty straightforward.

179
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:09,030
I just divided this piece
into N, this center thing

180
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:15,550
into N-- So I called
that distance h.

181
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,820
So Nh gets me out to here.

182
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,560
Whatever that is, that's
cos(pi/8), I guess,

183
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,410
that's the x coordinate
of that line.

184
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,850
So those are mesh points and
then let me keep drawing these.

185
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,390
So these will be
mesh points too,

186
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,990
and these will be
mesh points too.

187
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:44,850
So at this point, I've got
probably 12 or 13 mesh points.

188
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,460
But I've got quads, right?

189
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,120
Well, I've got a
couple of triangles

190
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,930
here that I'm not going
to touch, those are fine.

191
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:56,460
But these are quads
and they could

192
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,430
be used with the Q_1
element, but I'm thinking

193
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,340
let's stay with triangles.

194
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,490
So I just suggested
to put in triangles,

195
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:10,060
put in these diagonals,
keeping symmetry.

196
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,590
And so there's the mesh.

197
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,130
There's the mesh.

198
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,200
And then what does
the code ask for?

199
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,220
So I've got 13 mesh points.

200
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,380
And the code, first
of all it wants

201
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,360
a list of the coordinates
of all those mesh points.

202
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,440
So that the code will-- And I
better number them, of course.

203
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,230
So let me number them
one, shall I number

204
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:41,380
them the center guys first,
one, two, three, four, five,

205
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,430
and then up here six,
seven, eight, nine, now

206
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,760
I don't know if this
is a good numbering.

207
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,410
10, 11, 12, 13.

208
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:57,830
Why don't we, just to have
some consistency within plans,

209
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,110
why don't you, you
don't have to take N=4.

210
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,280
I hope you'll take, what did
I take N as four or five?

211
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,160
Yeah, right.

212
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,990
N is 4.

213
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,370
But you'll want to
try different N's.

214
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,000
N=4 would be a good crude
start to see what's going

215
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,060
on, but then I hope you'll go
higher and get better accuracy.

216
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,230
And you can see how the accuracy
improves, how you get closer

217
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,620
to that, as N gets bigger.

218
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,980
OK, we've got the
nodes numbered.

219
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,250
Oh, I better number
the triangles.

220
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,070
OK, how shall we
number the triangles?

221
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,070
Shall we do along
the top, or this?

222
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,610
I don't know.

223
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,980
What do you want to do for the
numbering of the triangles?

224
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,790
Maybe run along
the top, and then

225
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,590
run along the bottom,
because then it'll

226
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,160
practically be a copy.

227
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,710
So I didn't leave myself much
space, but one, two, three,

228
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:04,140
four, five, six, seven.

229
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,950
Seven triangles along the top
and seven along the bottom,

230
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:14,340
so I have 14 triangles
in this mesh.

231
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:23,150
So it's a mesh with 14
triangles and 13 nodes.

232
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,220
And I know the positions
of everyone, right?

233
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,210
I know the x,y
coordinates of every one.

234
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:34,740
So what the code will want is
a list of those coordinates.

235
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,920
So a list p, p will be
a list of coordinates.

236
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:50,810
The first guy will be-- Of the
nodes so 13 rows, 3 columns.

237
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,830
So it's a little 13 by
3 matrix that tells you

238
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,580
where all the nodes are.

239
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:01,330
So the first one on that
list would be (0,0).

240
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,330
That's for node one.

241
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,800
And the second one would
be whatever the coordinates

242
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,940
of that are, something,
zero. (h,0), I guess it is.

243
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:18,610
The third one will be (2h,0),
and so on, and then complete

244
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,000
the list of 13 positions.

245
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,860
So you have then told the
code where all the nodes are.

246
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,870
What else do you
have to tell it?

247
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,370
Not much.

248
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,350
You now have to tell
it about the triangles.

249
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,620
So now for every, why
do I say three columns?

250
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,010
Maybe only two, is it?

251
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,460
You see the point already.

252
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:53,580
I've forgotten, maybe, yeah.

253
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:58,510
I don't see why.

254
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,560
Well for triangles, I'm
going to need three,

255
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,310
for nodes maybe
it's only got two.

256
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,250
Maybe it's 13 by 2.

257
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,380
I don't see why I need three.

258
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,460
But, anyway.

259
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,830
Then the other
list is triangles.

260
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,890
So this will be the
list t, and so it

261
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,450
takes triangle number one.

262
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,990
Which is right here.

263
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,760
That very first triangle.

264
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,690
And what does it have to
tell us about triangle one?

265
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,970
The three nodes.

266
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,980
If it tells us the
three node numbers,

267
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,810
and this list, p, gave their
positions, we've got it.

268
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,380
So how many triangles
did that I have?

269
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,310
14?

270
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:53,830
So t will be 14 by 3,
and so the first guy

271
00:17:53,830 --> 00:18:00,750
will be just one, node
number one, node number two,

272
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,930
and node number six.

273
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,580
That will tell us which
is the first triangle.

274
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,960
And the second triangle, I
guess I've drawn from two

275
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,510
to seven to six, right?

276
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,160
That's a very skinny
triangle up there

277
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,240
but it's the one that started
at node two, went up to seven

278
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,620
and back to six.

279
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,960
So a list like that.

280
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,850
And then the code
will do the rest.

281
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,750
I hope.

282
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,320
Almost all the rest.

283
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,740
The code will create the matrix
K. It'll create the matrix

284
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,950
K with, it'll be singular.

285
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,500
Boundary conditions
won't yet be in there.

286
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,480
And then a final
step after that, K,

287
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,910
or maybe we could call
it K_0, is created,

288
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:02,760
a final step will be to fix u.

289
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,600
At least at these three points.

290
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,370
So these three will
be boundary nodes.

291
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,750
And as I say, I'm not too sure
about that one, I apologize.

292
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,260
At those boundary
nodes I'm going

293
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,890
to take the values to be zero.

294
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,010
So this is going to be
zero along the whole edge,

295
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,900
because if it's zero there,
zero there, zero there and zero

296
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,950
there, and if it's
linear, it's zero.

297
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:34,380
So the final sort of
subroutine in the code,

298
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,720
the final group of commands you
want to impose, zeroes here,

299
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,480
that should then make
the matrix K invertible,

300
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,300
and then you've
got KU=F to solve.

301
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,860
So what the code is doing
is creating K and F.

302
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,590
You see the overall picture?

303
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,320
I jumped right into
this particular mesh,

304
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,540
particular problem, but
now I really should back up

305
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,740
to where it starts.

306
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,010
This is going to be the weak
form of Laplace, Poisson,

307
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:24,420
maybe I'll make a little space
to put in Poisson's name too.

308
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:29,770
You have a picture already of
what this weak form is about,

309
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,550
so now I'm really
backing up to the start.

310
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,660
I take the equation and
I get its weak form.

311
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,140
And remember that's in
the continuous case,

312
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,730
as it was in the quiz problem.

313
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,940
The first step is the
continuous weak form,

314
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,010
and then the second
step is choose

315
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:56,890
test functions and trial-- I'm
sorry, gosh, I'm in bad shape

316
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,620
here.

317
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,360
Because they're the same.

318
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,450
This isn't my
worst error, today.

319
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:11,881
But those are trial functions,
and these are test functions.

320
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:14,380
OK, questions at this point,
because I've-- Yeah, thank you.

321
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,220
Good.

322
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,590
Let's look at this picture.

323
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:22,830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

324
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:30,010
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Because-- We did.

325
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,850
That's right.

326
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:37,180
So because my
question is what is--

327
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,560
The continuous problem I
would like to solve has u=0

328
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,930
on the polygon.

329
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:50,600
So in a way you can
forget the circle,

330
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,490
where we know the answer.

331
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,880
Now, we really are
looking on the polygon,

332
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,330
and I would like to
know what's the solution

333
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,810
like on that polygon.

334
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:06,490
And then so there are
two steps, the first step

335
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,130
was start with a circle,
we have the answer.

336
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:14,180
Second step is go to a polygon,
continuous problem, Poisson's

337
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,120
equation in the polygon.

338
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,930
How different is that from this?

339
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:23,010
Because this will not
satisfy the polygon

340
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,480
boundary conditions.

341
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,330
So that's the circle answer.

342
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,460
Then the question is,
what's the polygon answer.

343
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,070
And I don't know that.

344
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,070
You may say a regular
polygon, you can't do that.

345
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,270
I didn't think you can.

346
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,490
It's amazing, but probably
a triangle or a square.

347
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,780
So if M is three or four,
probably some formulas

348
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,670
would be available.

349
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,990
But I think once
we get higher, I

350
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,990
don't know the answer to
the Dirichlet problem,

351
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,890
to Poisson's equation on a
polygon, on a regular polygon.

352
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,830
And that's what I would really
like to know more about.

353
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,190
And how do I find
out more about it?

354
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,670
By finite elements.

355
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,780
With your help.

356
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:16,070
Taking that polygon,
breaking it into a mesh,

357
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,960
looking only at one triangle
just for simplicity,

358
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,510
and getting u finite elements.

359
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,350
Well, I should say u_(P_1).

360
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,750


361
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,560
That's the finite element
solution using linear.

362
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,130
I would really like
to know u_(P_2),

363
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,470
the finite element solution
which will be better,

364
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,260
if I use quadratics.

365
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,420
So now I get the
fun of describing

366
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,090
the linear elements, the
quadratic elements, the quads.

367
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,080
But did I answer
that question OK?

368
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,070
Yeah.

369
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:59,630
So this is the problem I would
like to know the answer to.

370
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,170
If I have this
equation, zero boundary

371
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,970
conditions on a regular
polygon with M sides,

372
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,780
what's the answer?

373
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,270
And it's going to be close to
this, but it won't be the same.

374
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:17,830
Because this does not
vanish on the polygon edges.

375
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:22,740
And I would like to
compare the slopes, too.

376
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,970
So the homework problem
asked you not only to compare

377
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:32,820
u_circle with u_(P_1),
but also the slopes.

378
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,380
The slopes here are
easy, slopes here

379
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,420
are easy because it's a
bunch of flat functions.

380
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,190
So the slopes are just
constant in each triangle.

381
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:48,720
OK, I'm guessing that the error
gets smaller as you go in.

382
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,810
I think that if
you plot the error,

383
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,920
it'll be largest out
here and get small there.

384
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,750
But remains to be seen.

385
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,180
So I hope you
enjoy-- yeah, good.

00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,480
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Rather than seven.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

389
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,610
PROFESSOR STRANG:
No, the middle.

390
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,670
There's nothing magic
about any particular mesh.

391
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,750
I just chose this
mesh as pretty good,

392
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:34,737
and actually, I'm imagining
M could get pretty big.

393
00:25:34,737 --> 00:25:35,820
That would be interesting.

394
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,580
M=8 would be interesting,
M=16, M=1,024,

395
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,760
now then I'd really
get interested.

396
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:50,130
OK, but so if M is 1,024, then
this side would be very small.

397
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,060
Right?

398
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,590
And I just wanted
more triangles.

399
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,590
Actually, I would like
more than I've got.

400
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:04,760
I'd like, if M was
really big, then

401
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,540
probably N should be
at least that big.

402
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,570
So I should have a
thousand this way,

403
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,100
if this is just a tiny bit.

404
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,970
I just want little
tiny h, and then, yeah.

405
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,040
Actually, that might
not be too bad.

406
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,900
If M and N were
roughly comparable,

407
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:26,460
then that length
would be roughly

408
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,580
comparable to these lengths.

409
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,610
And the triangles would
be pretty good shapes.

410
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,780
And that's what
you're looking for.

411
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:43,070
I think there's a lot of
experiments to be done here.

412
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,160
So, I'm thinking
then of M and N. Here

413
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,560
I took N to be just four.

414
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,500
When M was eight.

415
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,780
That's fine.

416
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,240
But if you keep M and N
roughly the same size,

417
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,600
then you've got triangles that
are not too long and skinny.

418
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,130
I'll tell you when
you might want.

419
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,590
So generally you want
nice shaped triangles.

420
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:13,260
You don't want angles very
small or very large, usually.

421
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,410
But there would be,
anybody in Course 16

422
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:23,330
can imagine that if I
am computing the flow

423
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:31,120
field past a wing, that long,
thin triangles in the direction

424
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,030
of the wing are natural.

425
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:41,390
I mean, somehow a problem
like true aerodynamics

426
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,210
is by no means isotropic.

427
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,940
I mean, the
direction of the wing

428
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,410
is kind of critical to whether
the plane flies, right?

429
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:54,670
So don't make the wing vertical.

430
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,430
And if you want
accuracy, then you

431
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,880
have long, thin triangles in
the direction of the flow.

432
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,140
But here we're not
doing a flow problem.

433
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,740
We haven't got shocks,
or trailing edges,

434
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,080
and other horrible stuff
that makes planes fly.

435
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,960
We just got Poisson's equation.

436
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,720
OK.

437
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,595
Thanks for those good
questions, another one.

438
00:28:15,595 --> 00:28:18,582
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

439
00:28:18,582 --> 00:28:20,790
PROFESSOR STRANG: What would
the dimension look like?

440
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,710
Ah, would you like me to show
you something about quadratics?

441
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,030
Yeah.

442
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,980
Shall I jump into
quadratics, it's kind of fun.

443
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:36,700
Quadratics, so let
me just do-- So I'll

444
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,630
come back to the weak
form, right it's totally--

445
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,730
Oh, I'll do it now.

446
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,110
It's so simple I don't
want to forget it.

447
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:51,330
The weak form, so I write the
equation down, -u_xx-u_yy=f.

448
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:57,920
This is the continuous weak
form, equal f(x,y), OK?

449
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,400
So that's the strong form.

450
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,780
And I've made it the Laplacian
here to keep it simple,

451
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,640
and any right-hand side.

452
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,560
OK, how do I get
to the weak form?

453
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,940
Just remind me, I multiply
both sides by any test function

454
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,680
v(x,y).

455
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:23,180
Multiply by v(x,y),
and then what do I do?

456
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:28,260
I integrate over
the whole region.

457
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:36,780
So that's the weak form, dxdy,
this is for all v, all v(x,y),

458
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:42,340
all, I'll say all
admissible v(x,y).

459
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,830
So that's the weak form.

460
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:51,420
If this holds for this great
family of v's, the idea behind

461
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:56,060
it is, that if this holds for
all these trial functions,

462
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:00,740
test functions, v(x,y), the only
way that can happen is for this

463
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,560
to actually equal that.

464
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:12,370
That's a fundamental lemma
in this part of math,

465
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,630
and of course it has
to be spelled out

466
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,280
more than I'm doing in words.

467
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,120
But the idea is that if these
hold for such a large class

468
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,520
of v(x,y), then the only
way that can happen is

469
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,980
for the strong form to hold.

470
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,260
For this to actually match this.

471
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,290
OK, so that's the start.

472
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:35,470
But then what's the next
step in the weak form?

473
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,790
I like the right-hand
side but I'm not

474
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,990
so crazy about the
left-hand side.

475
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,820
I'm not crazy about
it because this

476
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,940
has second derivatives of u,
and my little roof functions,

477
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,640
pyramid functions, haven't
got second derivatives.

478
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,150
So I would be dead in
the water without doing

479
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:58,530
the natural step that makes
everything beautiful, which is?

480
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,160
Integration by parts.

481
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,320
Integrate by parts.

482
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:07,540
Move derivatives off of u,
onto v. One derivative onto v,

483
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:12,320
off of u, so then u and v
each have one derivative.

484
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,180
I can use my piecewise
linear, piecewise quadratic,

485
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,080
all my finite elements
are going to go fine.

486
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,370
So I integrate by parts.

487
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:28,000
So integrate by parts, and
what is that mean in 2-D?

488
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,830
Of course I have a
double integral here.

489
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:37,990
So integrate by parts, that mean
you use the Green's formula.

490
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:47,230
That was the key point of this
Green, or Gauss-Green formula.

491
00:31:47,230 --> 00:32:01,630
Can I do it first in, this is
-div(grad u), times v dxdy,

492
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,740
we can write out all the terms.

493
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,750
We can use vector notation.

494
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,770
I could use that nabla, that
upside down triangle notation,

495
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,730
or whatever.

496
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,710
But maybe good to see
it a few different ways.

497
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,220
So what's the point?

498
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:20,220
When I integrate by parts, that
minus disappears to a plus,

499
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:26,080
I have a double integral then,
and these derivatives move

500
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,360
off of-- I'm taking one
derivative off of here,

501
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,540
the divergence moves over there,
but when the divergence moves

502
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,140
onto v it becomes?

503
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,890
The transpose.

504
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:40,890
It becomes gradient.

505
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:52,520
And so this is gradient
of u, gradient of v, dxdy.

506
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,860
Plus boundary terms.

507
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,700
The integral of,
what is, let's see.

508
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,730


509
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:12,380
What do I have in this integral,
I have grad u dot n, times v

510
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,090
around the boundary.

511
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:19,140
And with my boundary conditions
that's going to be gone,

512
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,720
so I can come back to that.

513
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,410
Now, you all looked
a little uncertain

514
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,090
when I wrote Green's
formula this way.

515
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:33,630
For this problem I can
write it more easily.

516
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,770
This is my left side.

517
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,160
I want to write
the answer, I just

518
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,960
want to write this weak
form in a much simpler form.

519
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,970
So let me say, what
have I got here.

520
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:53,390
Well, all I've got
is one derivative

521
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:57,320
is moving off of u and
onto v. And the minus sign

522
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,890
is disappearing, so I
have du/dx times dv/dx.

523
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:03,940
Right?

524
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,390
One off of u, onto
v. The other term,

525
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:13,730
one y derivative, moving off
of this and onto v. Minus sign

526
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,640
again going to a plus.

527
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,700
du/dy, dv/dy.

528
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,770
That's the integral.

529
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,860
That's it, that's cool.

530
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,910
Easy to do.

531
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:29,270
And on the right-hand side
of course I have no change.

532
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:34,410
The integral of
f(x,y) v(x,y) dy.

533
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,101
Now, that's the weak form.

534
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:36,600
dxdy.

535
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:44,420


536
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:52,780
Here it is, weak form.

537
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,210
That's pretty nice.

538
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,050
Beautifully symmetric,
so the matrix

539
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:03,660
that comes up when we plug in
finite specific trial functions

540
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,310
and test functions is going
to be a symmetric matrix

541
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:11,050
K. And the integrals are
of first derivatives,

542
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:18,230
so as long as our functions,
our trial functions and test

543
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:24,270
functions are continuous,
that is, they shouldn't jump.

544
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,540
If the trial functions
or test functions jump,

545
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,180
then if I have a jump, then the
derivative would be a delta.

546
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,000
I'd have another
delta here, I'd have

547
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,010
an integral delta, a delta times
delta, and I don't want that.

548
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,720
That's infinite.

549
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,960
Those discontinuous elements
would not be conforming,

550
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,800
and that's a whole new world
of discontinuous Galerkin.

551
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,940
I'd have to impose
penalty stuff,

552
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,070
and Professor
Peraire I mentioned,

553
00:35:54,070 --> 00:36:00,720
and others, Professor Darmofal
in aero, are experts on this.

554
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,900
We're doing continuous Galerkin.

555
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,930
CG.

556
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,480
Our piecewise linear,
piecewise quadratic,

557
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,870
they'll be continuous.

558
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,410
All I have to do is
these derivatives.

559
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,690
Integrate those things and
that's what the code will do.

560
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:19,980
OK, I've got to the weak form.

561
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,650
That's the weak form.

562
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,350
Now comes the
finite element idea.

563
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,980
So there is our weak form, now
ready for the finite element

564
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,310
idea.

565
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:34,430
OK, so what was that idea?

566
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,720
That's the continuous problem.

567
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:47,600
Now, the finite element idea
is, plug in U as a combination--

568
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,170
Let me write out the terms.

569
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:55,160
You know what's coming here.

570
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,260
If I'm using finite
elements, I'm

571
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:07,650
going to choose nice
polynomials phi, say N of them.

572
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,910
That would be like,
one for every node,

573
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:14,990
so I would have
13 functions here.

574
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:18,670
I'm going to choose the V's
to be the same as the phis.

575
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:22,850
And then, I'm working
then in 13 dimensions

576
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:26,380
instead of infinite dimensions.

577
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,040
So what do I do?

578
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,430
For this limited subspace,
this finite element subspace,

579
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,290
this piecewise polynomial,
piecewise linear subspace,

580
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:41,080
I plug that into the
weak form and I test it

581
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,860
against 13 V's, which are phis.

582
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:53,130
So I plug that in,
so now what is K?

583
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:59,580
Now let me just say, so I
now have the integral of,

584
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,430
yeah I guess I'd
better plug it in.

585
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:07,630
K_ij would then
be the integral --

586
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:16,910
I'm just copying the weak form
in -- Of dU/dx d-- no, sorry,

587
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:22,360
I'd better just
plug it in first.

588
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:32,730
dU/dx*dV/dx plus dU/dy*dV/dy,
those are the integrals I have

589
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,270
to do.

590
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,120
And on the right
hand side I have

591
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,460
to do the f-integral. fV dxdy.

592
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,760
OK, plug that in.

593
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,950
That's the integral
over the whole domain.

594
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:56,070
When I plug it in this U is a
combination of known functions

595
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:05,230
and the V's will
be the same guys.

596
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,850
So what am I going to get here?

597
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:14,750
It's just as in 1-D. So no
new ideas entering here.

598
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:20,680
The new idea's going to enter
when I construct these phis.

599
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,230
Let me just say,
though, one thing.

600
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:27,970
In 1-D, we pretty
much had a choice

601
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,380
of-- When it was one dimension.

602
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,600
Just remember that.

603
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,540
In one dimension, when I
had these hat functions,

604
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,210
when I had these guys,
integrated against these guys,

605
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,410
I pretty much had
a choice of did

606
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,210
I want to think about
integrating that hat

607
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,390
function against that one.

608
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,380
Or actually it was
their derivatives.

609
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,280
It was the integral of U, yeah.

610
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,080
Of phi, what I needed
was all the integrals

611
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,530
of phi_i', phi_j'.

612
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:13,700
Those are what I needed, these
go into K. Into the matrix K.

613
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,880
In fact, that's
what equals K_ij,

614
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,410
the integral of phi prime.

615
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:21,950
In 1-D. OK.

616
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:26,940
Now, what I was going
to say, I could do it

617
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,690
this way if I wanted.

618
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,860
But you remember the
other way to do it?

619
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,890
Was element at a time.

620
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,190
So this was one method here.

621
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:43,980
That found the entries of
K separately, one by one.

622
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,840
The other way was take
the elements, one by one.

623
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,010
So the other way was take an
element like this element.

624
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,970
It's got two functions,
two trial functions

625
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:57,850
are involved there.

626
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:02,530
There's a little two by
two, so this is four.

627
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:08,090
Two by two element matrices K_e.

628
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,040
And the quiz recalled that part.

629
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,550
That approach.

630
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:16,240
So what I want to say
is that's the right way

631
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,510
to do it in two dimensions.

632
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,240
A triangle at a time.

633
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,710
That's the way the
code will do it.

634
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,600
It creates these little
element matrices,

635
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:32,500
and then it stamps them into
the big matrix K. Alright.

636
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:42,150
So I want to do this integral
one triangle at a time.

637
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,420
Is the good way.

638
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,590
OK, and that's what
the code will do.

639
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,070
Actually, I think
that the best way

640
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:55,480
to learn these steps is just
to read the lines of the code.

641
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,520
You can read them in the
book, page 303 or something.

642
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,430
And you'll see it just doing all
the steps that need to be done.

643
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,930
One triangle at a time.

644
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,280
So, now.

645
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,540
Now comes the fun.

646
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,910
I get to answer, what do these
piecewise linear elements look

647
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:16,410
like?

648
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,750
What do the quadratic
elements look like?

649
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:24,340
What do the Q_1, quad
elements look like?

650
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,310
This was the golden
age of finite elements,

651
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:33,290
when people invented
these ways to create

652
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,490
piecewise polynomials.

653
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,100
And it continues.

654
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:41,680
People are still inventing,
I had a email this week,

655
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,750
somebody says I've
got spectral elements.

656
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,400
People are going higher
and higher degrees.

657
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,840
You, know sixth
degree, eighth degree.

658
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,700
In order to get more accuracy.

659
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,400
OK, let's start with P_1.

660
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,100
How do I describe a P_1
element inside a triangle?

661
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:07,490
So in a triangle,
the unknowns will

662
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,910
be the value-- This
has a height U_1,

663
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:17,220
this has a height U_2, and
a height U_3 at those nodes.

664
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:24,531
Inside the triangle, the
function U is linear.

665
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:25,030
a+bx+cy.

666
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:31,410


667
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:37,670
Then, you see that if I know
these three values, then

668
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,770
I know these three numbers.

669
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,820
And vice versa.

670
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,550
There's a three by
three matrix, right?

671
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:46,480
There has to be a three by--
Any time you see pictures

672
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,510
like this, like the
good part of 18.085

673
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:52,370
is to realize that if I
have three numbers here,

674
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,210
three values and I've
got three coefficients,

675
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,140
that there's some three by
three matrix that connects them

676
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,650
that you're going to need.

677
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:04,430
That's like a meta-message
of this course.

678
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:13,550
Is, you've got to translate
between the node values

679
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,500
and the coefficients.

680
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,760
Because the node values
are the unknowns, right?

681
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,260
These are the guys that
are multiplying the pyramid

682
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,370
function, this is multiplying
a pyramid function

683
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:30,920
with height one at that
point, going down to zero.

684
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,240
So this one will be a pyramid
function of height U_2

685
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,430
times one, going down to zero.

686
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,080
And U_3.

687
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,680
So we've got a flat
function in here.

688
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,970
And it looks exactly like that.

689
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,840
OK?

690
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,220
So what do I want to say?

691
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:57,010
We know the positions of these
three nodes from our list p,

692
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:57,840
right?

693
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,530
These were the crucial
things we needed.

694
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:05,240
The positions of all the
nodes, we know where they are.

695
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:10,960
Then there has to be a three
by three matrix that will now

696
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,510
connect to the coefficients.

697
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,450
Why do we want the coefficients?

698
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:18,630
Because those are what
we do when we integrate.

699
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,690
The coefficients
are what we need,

700
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,460
we need to integrate
dU/dx, dU/dy, dU/dz.

701
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,930
Sorry, dU/dx, dU/dy.

702
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:36,870
Are you visualizing this overall
solution capital U, yeah.

703
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,230
So the overall
solution capital U,

704
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,820
you should visualize
with a combination of all

705
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,100
the little U's, is
zero here and then

706
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,700
it's going to go up in these
triangles and bend around

707
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,580
and, I don't know,
maybe down again.

708
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,690
Or maybe, no, maybe
it keeps going up.

709
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:57,530
This is probably
the largest value,

710
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:00,850
because it's the largest
value in the correct solution.

711
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:11,060
So is this is probably going to
be the highest point of this,

712
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,370
what's-- The
Forbidden City, right?

713
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:21,770
In China, in Beijing is like,
or a single-- Do pagodas

714
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,821
have flat--?

715
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:24,320
No.

716
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:29,360
We we will meet
pagoda functions.

717
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:34,430
But this would be just an
ordinary western roof, I guess.

718
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:35,830
Just flat pieces.

719
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:36,570
Yeah.

720
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:40,290
OK, see, you've got
to see the whole thing

721
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,610
and then you look at each piece.

722
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:47,450
Each piece looks like that,
and the integrals are doable.

723
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:54,240
OK, so while I'm going here,
I want to do quadratics.

724
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,880
You'll get the idea right away.

725
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,040
So, same triangle, now I'm
going to have quadratics.

726
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,810
So I'm now going to have,
so this won't be the arrow,

727
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,000
this arrow will now go this way.

728
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,530
I'm going to have d x
squared, exy, and f y squared.

729
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,160
So now how many
coefficients have

730
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,580
I got to determine a quadratic?

731
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,240
Six, right? a, b, c, d, e, f.

732
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,680
How many nodes do I need?

733
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,700
Six.

734
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,650
Where are they?

735
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:29,710
Well, the natural positions are
those guys in the mid-points.

736
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,310
So now, those are all nodes now.

737
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:38,010
Some nodes are at
vertices of triangles,

738
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,790
some nodes are at midpoints.

739
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,320
But remember, we've
got other triangles

740
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,180
hooking on here,
many other triangles,

741
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:48,170
all with their own six nodes.

742
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:51,310
Well, not their own,
because they share.

743
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,730
That's a big point.

744
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:59,970
So there's a grid of triangles,
with nodes for quadratic.

745
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:02,750
And we've got one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight,

746
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:09,410
nine, ten, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16 nodes, I think.

747
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:13,370
And within each triangle,
this is what we've got.

748
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:17,930
So there's a six by six
matrix for each triangle.

749
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,440
A six by six matrix
which will connect

750
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:29,260
the values U_1, U_2, U_3, U_4,
U_5, U_6 for this triangle.

751
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,510
Connect those six heights
with these six numbers.

752
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:42,100
And what will the roof look
like within that triangle?

753
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,000
Well, sort of curved.

754
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,200
A parabola, right?

755
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,290
A parabola somehow in 2-D,
it'll look like this, yeah.

756
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:49,790
Yeah.

757
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:52,280
And here's the key question.

758
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:59,350
Will that roof, that curvy
roof, fit the one over there?

759
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,830
Because if it didn't
fit, we're in trouble.

760
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,890
This derivative would
have a delta function,

761
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:07,640
and we've got delta functions,
and integrals squaring them

762
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,320
would give infinite.

763
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,930
So here's the question.

764
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:16,830
Why does this roof, using these
six points, fit onto the roof

765
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:23,900
that uses U_7, U_8, U_9,
and U_3, U_4 and U_5?

766
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,230
Why do those two
roofs fit together?

767
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,990
This is the fun of
piecewise polynomials?

768
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,200
Of course, the
slope will change.

769
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,480
But the roof won't have a gap.

770
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,050
Water won't go through it.

771
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,560
Why's that?

772
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,110
Do you see why?

773
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:46,190
Because what do they share, what
do those two curvy roofs share?

774
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:48,060
They share a side.

775
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:53,680
They share the same
values along the side.

776
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,010
And are those three
values that are

777
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:59,660
shared along the side
sufficient to make

778
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,040
it match all along the side?

779
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:03,790
Yes.

780
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,340
That's the important question.

781
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,550
Finite elements lives or
dies on that question.

782
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:14,350
The answer is yes, because
along that side, if I just

783
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:18,130
focus on that side,
where these three

784
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:23,150
values are shared on both sides,
by the triangle on both sides.

785
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:28,250
Along that edge, what kind
of a function have I got?

786
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,110
It's second degree.

787
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:34,660
This is whatever, when I
restrict this to just run along

788
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,030
a line, it's a parabola.

789
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:40,060
And the parabola is determined
by those three values.

790
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,940
So having it right
at three points

791
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,170
means I have it
right the whole way.

792
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:44,670
Yeah.

793
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:48,850
So there you see what quadratic
elements would look like,

794
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:52,500
and you could extend
the code in the book

795
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:57,320
and on the CSE site to work
for quadratic elements.

796
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,610
And you want to just guess what
cubic elements could look like?

797
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,380
I'm sorry, we've run
five minutes over,

798
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:06,340
but maybe finite
elements is worth it.

799
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:13,900
So if I had cubic elements,
any idea how many?

800
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,640
So I'm now going up to,
I'm adding g x cubed,

801
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:25,070
h, i, j, any idea how many
coefficients I now have?

802
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:28,630
Four new ones plus
these six is ten.

803
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,920
I need ten nodes.

804
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,310
Where I am I going to put
ten nodes in this triangle?

805
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:36,430
I want to put them, I'd like
to have some on the edges.

806
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:39,930
Because the edges help me make
triangles match each other.

807
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,140
They'll just be
like bowling balls.

808
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:52,400
So here's six, oops, that
wouldn't be believable.

809
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,300
Is that right?

810
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,790
Four, three, two, and one.

811
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:56,450
Yeah.

812
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,620
Yeah.

813
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,120
OK.

814
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:03,330
So, now I've got a
bubble node inside

815
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:10,730
and I've got four nodes of
vertices and two points,

816
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:14,420
at two 1/3 points,
and that will then

817
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,260
match the triangle next to it.

818
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,920
Because four points
determine a cubic.

819
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,860
There you go, I
hope you have fun,

820
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,680
I hope you have a great holiday.

821
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,140
I'll see you
Wednesday for Fourier

822
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:32,720
and always open for
questions on the MATLAB.
