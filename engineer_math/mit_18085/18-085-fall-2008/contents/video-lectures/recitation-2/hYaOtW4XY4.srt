9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,940
PROFESSOR STRANG: So this
is the first true review

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,860
session in 18.085.

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,820
The last Wednesday, the
first Wednesday afternoon,

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:38,450
was a brief review of
topics in linear algebra.

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,720
But now we're into the course.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,500
We've done four lectures
on the first four sections

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,210
of the textbook and one
homework problem in and back

16
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,530
and a second homework
set for next Monday.

17
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,490
So I'm ready for any questions,
including questions that are

18
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,090
on the homework if necessary.

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,020
But anything at all.

20
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,270
Or maybe I'll just
ask whether the pace,

21
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,740
so this is really informal.

22
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,580
Is the pace of the course, now
today's lecture had a lot in it

23
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,490
as I realized when I saw
that the board was still

24
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,330
full of 18.085 and
there was a little more

25
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,050
still to do because we didn't
finish the matrix part.

26
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:33,000
But are you okay with the
sort of speed of the course?

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,890
So that'll be one question.

28
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,770
And then, what about specifics?

29
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,461
Somebody start off if you will.

30
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:42,960
Anybody.

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,620
Yes, thanks.

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,617
AUDIENCE: Well, actually
I had a question

33
00:01:46,617 --> 00:01:47,950
about the lecture earlier today.

34
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,325
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Okay, go ahead.

35
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:51,760
AUDIENCE: I was just going to
look it up in the text, but.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,135
PROFESSOR STRANG:
That's alright.

37
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:54,970
AUDIENCE: But haven't
had a chance to.

38
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,260
But, okay, so I'm
not really sure

39
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,950
how you take the
initial conditions

40
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,300
and apply them to
the ramp function

41
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,070
to actually get a solution.

42
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,720
PROFESSOR STRANG: So that's
what luckily happens to be still

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,620
here on the board, right?

44
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,450
We've got these boundary--
I would call them

45
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,160
boundary conditions.

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,940
So this is definitely,
we're in a part of math

47
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,400
that's about boundary
value problems

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,470
more than-- time
isn't in the picture.

49
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,350
I mean later time will
get into the picture.

50
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:37,540
So with this particular
example, the general solution

51
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:44,540
is a standard ramp at the point
a where things are happening.

52
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,360
Plus the C+Dx, the usual.

53
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,270
So that's a particular solution.

54
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:59,060
That particular solution has the
right behavior at the impulse.

55
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,940
By the right behavior, I mean
that the second derivative

56
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:10,500
of the ramp is a delta and
when I put the ramp at a,

57
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,760
then the delta
will show up at a.

58
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,850
And when I put on
that minus sign

59
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,950
it'll mean that the second
derivative is minus the delta.

60
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,140
So the slope will step down.

61
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,940
So that's a particular solution.

62
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,220
But that by itself, what
does that equal at zero?

63
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,420
And what does that equal at
one if you remember the ramp?

64
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,770
So let me just draw
that ramp again.

65
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:44,680
So the ramp was really based
on, centered at the point a.

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,760
And I'll put it
with a minus sign.

67
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,120
So it came along
there and down there.

68
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,330
And now suppose this is
one end of our interval

69
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,480
and that's the other end.

70
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,420
So is that ramp the
answer to our problem?

71
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,950
No.

72
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:05,730
Well it happens to satisfy
this boundary condition,

73
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,130
happens to start out at zero.

74
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,710
But it doesn't end up at zero.

75
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:19,150
So just like every particular
solution we need a little more.

76
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,630
We have to include
more solutions

77
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,010
because that was only one.

78
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,100
All those are equally
good solutions.

79
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,050
If I add C+Dx, the second
derivative of that is zero,

80
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,100
so it doesn't spoil
anything at all.

81
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,750
On the contrary, it
adds more solutions.

82
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,380
I mean the great
thing we're using here

83
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:47,630
is that our equations
are linear and when

84
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,560
zero's on the
right-hand side-- notice

85
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,300
there's no arbitrary constant.

86
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,220
I'm not putting an
arbitrary constant

87
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,320
on that particular solution.

88
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,110
Is one particular
solution plus a

89
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,890
subspace if I use that language.

90
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,980
A lot of solutions to
the-- All the solutions

91
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,840
to the problem with zero
on the right-hand side.

92
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,230
And these are the
solutions, these

93
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,350
are the null space guys,
the ones that have zero

94
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,410
on the right-hand side.

95
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,410
Now we need those.

96
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,190
And the effect of those
will be to move that ramp.

97
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,880
And effectively, what
are they going to do?

98
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,620
They're going to swing that
ramp around, it'll stay a ramp.

99
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,750
But instead of being
level here, it'll go up.

100
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,810
And instead of going down
there, it'll go down there.

101
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,020
It'll be the same
ramp, with still

102
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,810
that slope dropped by one.

103
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,460
Slope went down by
minus one and that's not

104
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,920
going to change here.

105
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,380
The slope will still
go down by minus one.

106
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,450
But now I've just adjusted
it so that it goes through

107
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,090
the-- it satisfies the
boundary conditions.

108
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,690
And in the second problem
with the free end,

109
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,630
again, here's my ramp.

110
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,240
But now I'm going to adjust it.

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,410
And what happened?

112
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,470
It just needed
adjustment upwards.

113
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:26,890
Because this was the zero,
this was the u=0 fixed guy.

114
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,740
And now if I'm doing
u'(0)=0, the free guy,

115
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,320
I can lift the whole thing up.

116
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,290
So you see, I just
lifted it up to the point

117
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,390
where it came out right there.

118
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,200
So in this case I just
needed a C. And in this case

119
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,330
I just needed a Dx.

120
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,170
And in other cases I
might have needed both.

121
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,910
A little bit of C
and a little of Dx.

122
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:58,000
Anyway that's what was--
maybe that's sort of repeating

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,270
what we did today a little bit.

124
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:08,670
But mechanically it's just,
we've got a particular solution

125
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,790
and we've got the
complete solution

126
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,840
and then we just have
to choose C and D

127
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,330
and we've got two
conditions to do it with,

128
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,790
the two boundary conditions.

129
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,470
Could have other
boundary conditions.

130
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,040
Now, what about, here's a, yeah.

131
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,560
I guess what will often happen
in these review sessions is

132
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,410
I get on a roll and I just
keep, carry on with it.

133
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,210
You know, you start me with
a question and I can't stop.

134
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,890
So I'll go a little longer but
then I really will stop, ready

135
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,050
for the next one.

136
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,360
So we haven't discussed
the free-free. u(0) equal--

137
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,260
u', sorry, free is u'.

138
00:07:53,260 --> 00:08:00,710
That's free at the left
and free at the right.

139
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,580
What's up with that?

140
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,070
What's the solution to that?

141
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:13,490
Again, I'm looking for
-u'' equal an impulse.

142
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,920
With those two boundary
conditions, free-free.

143
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,510
And do you know what's
going to happen?

144
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,150
No solution.

145
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,740
Now it'd be interesting
to see why not.

146
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,130
Why no solution?

147
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,030
Well one way to do it is try.

148
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,000
Other right-hand sides
could have a solution.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,280
So it's not just that this is--
something's the matter here.

150
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,940
Specifically, that right-hand
side and most right-hand sides

151
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,220
will fail.

152
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,850
But let's just see
it with this one.

153
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,620
Why does that fail?

154
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,880
Well you can see I can't,
the slope here is zero

155
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,570
and the slope here is minus one.

156
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,540
If I adjust those
I can't get, this

157
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,440
is asking me to get
slope zero at both ends.

158
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,610
I can't do that, right?

159
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:17,130
Yeah, just not possible for me
to-- This will add a straight

160
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,160
line but it's the
same straight--

161
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,210
I can't get a ramp that
comes flat at both ends

162
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:27,050
because there's-- once I say
what it's doing at the ends,

163
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,160
I've got it.

164
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,530
And you see what I mean?

165
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:37,340
I'm looking for one that
starts flat and ends flat

166
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:45,620
and that's not in my
family of solutions.

167
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,480
That problem just
doesn't have a solution.

168
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,440
So that's one way to do it,
is look at the solutions

169
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,720
and realize you can't satisfy
both boundary conditions.

170
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,150
Another way might be this.

171
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:06,250
This is a little bit deeper
way and it leads to something

172
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,540
better.

173
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,540
Suppose I take the integral.

174
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,360
So this is an equation
that's supposed to hold.

175
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,160
Let me integrate both
sides from zero to one.

176
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,040
So there's the idea
I'm putting in now.

177
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,380
To go a little
further, to discover

178
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,430
when this has a solution.

179
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,080
Or let me take more
generally, -u''=f(x).

180
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,300


181
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,240
So some other load.

182
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,210
Not necessarily a point load,
not necessarily a uniform load,

183
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,030
but maybe some other load.

184
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:44,780
And now my boundary conditions,
I'm trying to do free-free.

185
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,400
And usually no solution.

186
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,540
But let's just see why and
when there might be a solution.

187
00:10:52,540 --> 00:11:02,530
The key idea is integrate
from zero to one.

188
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,140
What do I get on
the right-hand side?

189
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,280
Well, I get the integral
of f, whatever it is,

190
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,260
and I would call
that the total load.

191
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,650
Fair enough?

192
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,300
The total load of-- If
it was a delta function,

193
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,900
the total load would be one and
it would be all in one spot.

194
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,570
If it was uniformly
over the whole interval,

195
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,340
well I guess that would
also integrate to one,

196
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,900
so the total load would
be one spread out.

197
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,560
But it could be a mixture of
the two, could be a few delta

198
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,530
functions, whatever.

199
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:45,070
What happens when I integrate
the left side from zero to one?

200
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,510
Can you do that one?

201
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,980
The integral from zero to one.

202
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,290
There's that dopey
minus sign. u''dx.

203
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,220
What do I get?

204
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,190
Why do I say that's a good idea?

205
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,370
If I integrate the
second derivative

206
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,549
I get the first derivative.

207
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:07,090
The integral of the
second derivative

208
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,020
will be the first
derivative with the minus.

209
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,740
So it's minus the
first derivative.

210
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,350
And what do I do now?

211
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,970
I plug in the end points, right?

212
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,640
You integrate.

213
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,990
I'm integrating zero to one.

214
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,650
So I've found the integral.

215
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,100
I've put zero to one in there.

216
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,770
So what is that?

217
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:33,210
That's minus the
derivative at one

218
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:40,820
plus the derivative at zero.

219
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,870
And now, what's that?

220
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,010
That's zero.

221
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,610
By my boundary
conditions, that's zero.

222
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,890
So what have I found?

223
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,980
I've found that if these are the
boundary conditions, then when

224
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,120
I integrate the left side
it's going to give me zero.

225
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,740
So when, what loads
could be okay?

226
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:14,480
What loads f(x) could allow
me to solve this equation?

227
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,550
The condition will
be I need, what do I

228
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:24,260
need for the total load to be
able to solve this equation?

229
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,500
The integral of the
left side was zero

230
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,710
so the integral of the right
side had better be zero.

231
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,740
So that's the condition.

232
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,590
If I have these
boundary conditions,

233
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,430
then my problem is singular.

234
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,090
Usually no solution.

235
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,580
It's like having
a singular matrix.

236
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,920
It's like having this particular
singular matrix, of course.

237
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,530
Whoops, not that one.

238
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,700
Let me get the plus sign
in the right position.

239
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,330
That's a plus.

240
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,400
-1; -1, 2, -1; -1, 1.

241
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,380
Right?

242
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:08,080
This is the discrete version
with a zero slope at both ends.

243
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,540
It's our T matrix.

244
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,880
No, what matrix is it?

245
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,880
B. It's our B matrix, both ends.

246
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,120
I'll just come back here and
then I'll do the discrete one.

247
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,930
So tell me a load
that we could handle?

248
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,060
A load we could handle.

249
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,700
So the integral has to be zero.

250
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,640
So suppose my load has
a delta function at a.

251
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,030
Well that integral is one.

252
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,860
So can you fix that,
change that load

253
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,590
or do something, maybe
put on another load

254
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:53,770
to get a total load of zero?

255
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,980
What shall I do?

256
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,650
Add another guy
with a minus sign.

257
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,710
In other words,
maybe this, a delta

258
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,380
function at some other point b.

259
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,890
Well, that would do it.

260
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,190
I believe we could
solve that problem.

261
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:18,470
Even with these bad
boundary conditions.

262
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,170
We could solve that problem.

263
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,530
Because the total load would
be, one from that, minus one

264
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,290
from that, the total
load would be zero.

265
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,290
In other words, what would
are solution look like?

266
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,810
It has to start with zero slope.

267
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,520
So it would buzz alone
to a and then after b.

268
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,890
And what does it
have to do here?

269
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,050
If I graph the
solution to this guy

270
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:48,570
from zero to one it
starts with, it's

271
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,480
free, so nothing's
happening until I get to a.

272
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,940
Then what has to happen?

273
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,980
Let's see, if I'm
graphing u, it'll be ramp.

274
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,480
Right?

275
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,690
It'll be a ramp, yeah.

276
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,320
Because I've two derivatives.

277
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:11,110
And it has to ramp down by one,
so it'll ramp whatever it does.

278
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:15,540
I don't know where it stops.

279
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,190
Where does it?

280
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,150
Wait a minute.

281
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,150
I haven't practiced this.

282
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:26,000
So I start from the other end.

283
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,120
The other end is flat.

284
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,580
What's up?

285
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,830
They gotta meet here.

286
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,790
Oh, the other end is
flat, but not at zero!

287
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,780
Dumb, stupid.

288
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,280
Right.

289
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,040
Okay.

290
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,340
Yes, the other end
is flat, right.

291
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,050
And it's, oh yeah, look!

292
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,500
Oh, wonderful.

293
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,850
You see.

294
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,720
That slope dropped by
one and the slope there

295
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,130
increased by one back to zero.

296
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,490
Slope was zero.

297
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,460
It dropped to minus one
because of that load.

298
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,030
Now it increased
back to zero because

299
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:07,080
of this load with the minus
sign and there's a solution.

300
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,020
So that's a solvable problem.

301
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,330
Well, you say, okay, that
was a little surprising

302
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,020
to get an answer for
a singular problem.

303
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,990
And no, it can happen.

304
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,850
If we have a total
load zero it'll happen.

305
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:28,900
But, there is still a but,
that's not the only answer.

306
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,780
That picture is a solution.

307
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,310
But not the only one.

308
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,090
So what my point is
going to be, that when

309
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,140
the problem is singular,
if there's an answer,

310
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,390
you say great.

311
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,710
But then something has to
go wrong and what goes wrong

312
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,140
is too many answers.

313
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:54,440
So tell me some more, what other
graphs would draw solutions

314
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,350
to this problem.

315
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,430
I could shift, I could
lift the whole thing.

316
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,430
Here I've got a plus
C that I haven't used.

317
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,480
I could just do the
whole thing higher up.

318
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,260
Any of these.

319
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:17,160
These would all work.

320
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,470
It's like temperature.

321
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:23,500
I don't have an absolute
temperature here.

322
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:29,470
All I've got is, I would
have to-- It's not determined

323
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:35,800
because there's a plus C
that-- the plus C satisfied

324
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,050
everything.

325
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,270
A plus C, a constant has zero
slope, it has zero slope,

326
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,750
its second derivative is zero.

327
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:48,330
So it's like, unseen
by this equation.

328
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,890
And similarly can I
just make the analogy

329
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,440
as I always like to do with
discrete stuff, so suppose I--

330
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,100
Tell me a right-hand side
that we think would probably,

331
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,320
is this going to be the
same story for this guy?

332
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,250
Yes.

333
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,750
If I add those, where
I integrated there,

334
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,940
here I would add and I
get zero, zero, zero.

335
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,740
So this has to add to zero
if there's a solution.

336
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,270
So let me put for
example, [0,  1, -1].

337
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,800
That would be kind of like our
delta function in one direction

338
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,550
and our delta
function in the other.

339
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,860
I believe I can
solve that problem.

340
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,540
So I'm just carrying,
because I always

341
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,970
want you to see the discrete
one as well as the continuous.

342
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,430
Continuous involved
this integration.

343
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:47,310
The finite one just
involves adding.

344
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,870
The left side adds to zero
so the right-hand side better

345
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,140
add to zero.

346
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,540
That right-hand side does.

347
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,770
Tell me a solution.

348
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,620
Well, let me start out
with a seven there.

349
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:04,250
What's the next guy going to be?

350
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,880
See, I want seven.

351
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,540
Whatever I put there, I better
have a seven there, right?

352
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,680
Seven, seven, good.

353
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,150
Minus seven, plus 14, oh geez.

354
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:22,180
I didn't know this
was going to happen.

355
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,160
No, I want to get
the answer one.

356
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,250
What number goes there?

357
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,940
Six, is it six?

358
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,780
It's six, yeah, good.

359
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,610
Minus seven, 14,
minus six is that.

360
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,540
And now my claim is
that we'll come out

361
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,440
right on the third equation.

362
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,920
So far I've just
matched the first two.

363
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,780
Now this one gives
minus seven, plus six,

364
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,750
that's minus one, good.

365
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,780
So there's a solution.

366
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,310
And I'll leave
this problem alone

367
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,670
if you tell me the
rest, other solutions.

368
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,670
That [7, 7, 6] was a solution
to a singular problem

369
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,690
with a right-hand side
that had total load zero,

370
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,380
so it was okay.

371
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,530
But now that's a solution,
but there are more.

372
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:13,550
Tell me another one.

373
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,720
I can shift it, right?

374
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,330
I could make it [17, 17, 16].

375
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,091
I could add ten to everything.

376
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:21,590
Right?

377
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,830
That's the plus C that
I could do over there.

378
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:30,590
That can't change because
17 - 17 is still zero.

379
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,400
-17 + 16 will
still be minus one.

380
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,370
All good.

381
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,280
So actually that just
like helps our intuition,

382
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,170
and physically my
intuition is this.

383
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:49,180
That I've got this bar
and nothing's holding it.

384
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:57,210
So if I put a weight on it,
nothing to hold it, it'll just,

385
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,030
rigid motion will take
it out of sight, no good.

386
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,380
But if I put another
equal weight on it,

387
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,470
no it's not a weight.

388
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,220
What do I call it?

389
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,870
If I lift it at
that point, that's

390
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,940
the other delta function
that's going the other way,

391
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,640
then it will sit there.

392
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,310
But it would still
be in equilibrium

393
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:21,310
if I just moved it up to
there or moved it as I like.

394
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:26,690
I don't know if that is
kind of a dumb picture.

395
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,780
But it's saying what
we've said from math.

396
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,940
Well, you see where
your question led.

397
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:44,440
Yeah, thanks.

398
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,300
No, the integral, it was--
Watch what we integrated.

399
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,460
We integrated u''.

400
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,280


401
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,940
So that's not the area.

402
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,580
We integrated u'' and
got its integral was u'.

403
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,150
So that just told
us that a difference

404
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,270
in slopes at the ends, yeah.

405
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,904
Good, because our
intuition automatically

406
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:10,320
is if we're
integrating something,

407
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,740
we're finding an area.

408
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,210
But here, if it was u , then
I'd be finding the area under u,

409
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,910
but we integrated the
second derivative.

410
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,420
Right, good.

411
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,810
Now let's change the subject.

412
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:33,520
Yes, please.

413
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,920
Yeah, I guess so.

414
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:44,090
I'll try.

415
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,100
Let's see.

416
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:53,080
So my discrete
equation was like -u...

417
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,160
Yeah, so let's back
up to the beginning.

418
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,510
We've got this
minus sign and we're

419
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,720
using a second difference.

420
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,880
So second differences
have coefficients

421
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,360
one, minus two and one.

422
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,120
Now I'm reversing the
signs because of my minus.

423
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,650
So I have -u at some point.

424
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,020
Let's take that as
the point to the left.

425
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,000
Two u's at what I'll think
of as the center point,

426
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,160
minus u_(i-1).

427
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:29,680
Is the load at that center.

428
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:37,180
That center point
is i times delta x.

429
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,820
That's where I would be looking.

430
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,320
So now I'm using subscript.

431
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,190
It's a little bit of practice
then to take subscripts, take

432
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:57,090
this way of writing the equation
and convert it to a matrix way.

433
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:01,010
It's usually clearer once
you see it as a matrix.

434
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,850
Now this is happening
at all the points.

435
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:24,610
At i=1, let's say, I have
-u_0+2u_1-u_2 is f at, agrees

436
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:30,010
with the load at the
first mesh point.

437
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:36,060
That's the center,
the point h delta x.

438
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:42,330
And then if I want to back up
further, I would have -u_(-1),

439
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:49,860
but that doesn't really exist,
plus 2u_0-u_1 should match

440
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:55,750
the load at zero.

441
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,980
And so on forward.

442
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,299
But now I want to put in
the boundary condition.

443
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,840
That's what you want
me to do, right?

444
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,840
Put in this boundary condition.

445
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:11,720
So what am I going to take
as boundary condition?

446
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,000
It has to be some
approximation to u'(0)=0.

447
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,320


448
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,510
Maybe I'm never going
to get to minus one.

449
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:33,870
Maybe I don't need minus one.

450
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,020
That's right, yeah, exactly.

451
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,530
We did.

452
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,790
That's what we knew about it.

453
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,220
Sending it forward, we knew
about forward difference,

454
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:51,360
so I chose to do it.

455
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,700
But then I think better of it.

456
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,650
I chose to do it because it
made the point that we, that

457
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:02,140
at that boundary we were
introducing a higher order

458
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:08,020
error, first order error
that's going to wreck things.

459
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:13,350
I mean, it's going to spoil the,
this is second order accuracy.

460
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,520
And, but let me do
that first order.

461
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,480
So what shall I take?

462
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,400
I'm going to approximate
that by u-- Shall

463
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:33,260
I take this one
as I did in class?

464
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,850
Yes.

465
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,560
Ah, plus one, thanks, plus
one, right, thank you.

466
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,370
Thank you, good.

467
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,940
Okeydoke.

468
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,200
Alright.

469
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,000
This is how we got
to that equation.

470
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,390
If I now bring in this
boundary condition--

471
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:57,110
I guess I don't have to,
let me take your eye off

472
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:02,530
of that guy for the
moment, I think.

473
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,140
We're getting
beautiful music here.

474
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,210
Is it coming out of this box or?

475
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,420
No.

476
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:14,100
Anyway.

477
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,730
So I'm going to use
this boundary condition

478
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,280
to say, well okay,
if u_1 is u_0,

479
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,800
I'm going to replace
this u_0 by u_1.

480
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,630


481
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,680
This is the direct way.

482
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,290
I replaced that u_0 by u_1
in that first equation.

483
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:38,130
And then what I have is -u_1
and 2u_1, so that's the one

484
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,660
and I have the -u_2.

485
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,640
So do you see that that
equation, when I put those

486
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:53,650
together into a one, is
going to-- If this is u_1,

487
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:58,190
this is u_2, this is u_3
onwards, that first equation is

488
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,600
u_1-u_2 and that's
what I've got.

489
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,190
This is u_1-u_2.

490
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:09,070


491
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,760
So I did it.

492
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,150
I got to that matrix.

493
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,530
The matrix is actually
quite an important matrix.

494
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,440
But from the point
of view of accuracy

495
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,120
in solving this
differential equation,

496
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,220
it's not the greatest.

497
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,080
It's lost accuracy
at that point.

498
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,070
But the way to
recover it turned out

499
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:35,340
to be just a small adjustment at
the boundary, so not a problem.

500
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,880
Thanks.

501
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,490
That's good.

502
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:41,040
Yes, thanks.

503
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:48,877
Sorry?

504
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:49,960
When the boundary-- sorry.

505
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,390
Two boundary conditions
at the same point?

506
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,070
That's a good question.

507
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,510
So when would we have two?

508
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,160
So instead of a boundary
condition at zero

509
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,120
and a boundary condition at
one, you're putting them,

510
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,200
is that what you mean?

511
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,860
Put both boundary
conditions at the end.

512
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,000
Okay.

513
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,830
So that would be,
that would happen,

514
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,440
I would think that
would be more,

515
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,370
it would be very
typical in a, let

516
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:22,430
me see if there's
some space here, yeah.

517
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:28,190
That would be very
typical and we will do it,

518
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,220
can I change x to t?

519
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:38,060
Because that's what,
if I have some.

520
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,780
What does this
problem look like?

521
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:45,230
And u(0)=0 and u'(0)=0.

522
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:52,260
Both at the same, at the
start equals zero or whatever.

523
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,400
So what kind of a
problem is that?

524
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,600
Now these are, I would
say, initial values.

525
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,270
Initial values
instead of boundary

526
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,550
values, I now have
initial values.

527
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,840
And can I solve it?

528
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,020
Yes.

529
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,890
So I'm starting at time zero.

530
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,880
This is t=0.

531
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,440
I'm starting at rest.

532
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,180
No velocity and actually
no displacement and just

533
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,850
going forward in time.

534
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:30,100
So I could solve that
differential equation.

535
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,620
I'd be interested in the
corresponding difference

536
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,170
equation.

537
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,970
All fine.

538
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,960
It's a different
category of problem.

539
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:49,670
This is an initial
value problem.

540
00:31:49,670 --> 00:32:00,460
It's like tracking some
mass that's, some satellite.

541
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,790
So that's what you're doing
in tracking a satellite

542
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:09,360
or a planet or something.

543
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,860
Yeah, tracking a
planet or a satellite.

544
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,630
You're solving
equations like this.

545
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,770
Forward in time.

546
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,760
You know the initial
position and you

547
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,070
know the forces acting on it.

548
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,650
Probably gravity.

549
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,640
And you go forward in time.

550
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,810
Yes.

551
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,657
What would the matrix be?

552
00:32:33,657 --> 00:32:34,240
Good question.

553
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:41,620
What would the matrix look like?

554
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:46,810
So an electrical engineer
would call a problem like this,

555
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:50,080
and the kind of matrix that
I'm going to write down,

556
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,650
I think, would be called causal.

557
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:57,710
That word just popped into my
head, so let me mention it.

558
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:01,210
You know, part of science and
engineering, a big part of it

559
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,440
is learning language,
learning words.

560
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,360
And you have to learn
sort of the math language

561
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,790
and the engineering language
for whatever you're focusing on.

562
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:19,410
But it's good to also to
know a few other languages.

563
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,950
Electrical engineering
languages of filters

564
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:28,030
and causal and other things
that we'll see are important.

565
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:32,120
What would the matrix look like?

566
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,860
Here's what I think it would be.

567
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:42,320
I've made this a plus there
so I'll have to remember that.

568
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,720
I think, so I'm looking
at u_0, u_1-- No.

569
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,646
Well, u_0 I actually
know, so let

570
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:50,020
me start with u_1,
u_2, u_3, u_4.

571
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:55,310


572
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:58,671
What would a typical-- Equal
sum, right side, f_1, f_2,

573
00:33:58,671 --> 00:33:59,170
f_3, f_4.

574
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,330


575
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:06,710
What do you think, what kind
of a matrix am I going to get?

576
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,490
Before I put it in there.

577
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,620
This is a good question.

578
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,690
What's the shape of this matrix?

579
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:19,200
It's going to be triangular.

580
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,530
Instead of being symmetric
it's going to be triangular.

581
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,540
I'm going to find, let's
see, a typical value

582
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:35,570
would be, say, u_3 because
I've used a plus sign, oops!

583
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,540
I can't make myself do it right.

584
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,070
1, -2, 1.

585
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:54,695
That would say u_3-2u_2+u_1
would be the new force.

586
00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:56,570
This is the kind of
thing we're going to get.

587
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,547
One, maybe one something.

588
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:00,630
I don't know what this is.

589
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,460
This is up in the boundary,
in the initial values.

590
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:10,060
But from now on it'll
be below the diagonal.

591
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:15,470
It'll be 1, -2, 1.

592
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,390
Do you see?

593
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,050
We're marching.

594
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:25,140
We're marching forward.

595
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,660
We start by knowing
these and then

596
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,690
the equation tells
us the next one.

597
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,730
Then the equation
tells us the next one.

598
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,560
That's what initial
value problems do.

599
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,610
You're told how you begin
and you take a step,

600
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,090
you take a step, take
a step every time.

601
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:47,140
And the new value just needs
to know the older values.

602
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:52,220
Do you see the big difference
between that and our problems

603
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,440
here?

604
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,840
Our problem is
looking left and right

605
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,500
looking for back and forward.

606
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,800
Back for one condition,
forward for another.

607
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,470
We start with one, but
we're, it's more of a,

608
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,340
it's like a hitting problem.

609
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:15,150
We start forward, marching
forward in our problems,

610
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:19,240
but we have to hit the
other end correctly.

611
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,600
We don't know the slope, we
don't know the starting slope,

612
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,630
we know what we want to hit.

613
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:32,340
Whereas these problems, we're
told how we start and we just

614
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,380
follow it in time.

615
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:40,260
So that's the difference here.

616
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:49,680
Yeah, sure, okay.

617
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,710
That's true.

618
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,600
So this'll be known.

619
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,290
Yeah, that'll be known.

620
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,550
Yeah. u_1 will also be known.

621
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,360
Yeah, and really, maybe
I should have got,

622
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,060
let me put even the
other known one.

623
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,380
So we know this, we know this.

624
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,000
So those are sort
of not in our, yeah,

625
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:23,500
that shouldn't be in
our problem somehow.

626
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,197
No, I think, what would
we get in the end?

627
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:28,530
You're always looking backwards.

628
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,630
That's the point.

629
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,580
Lower triangular matrices
are always looking,

630
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,020
they only look backwards
for earlier values

631
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,110
and then they give
you the current value.

632
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:41,620
So that's why lower triangular
matrices are so easy to invert.

633
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,330
No problem.

634
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:46,840
If it's lower triangular, you
just, like, march forward.

635
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,740
And if it's upper triangular,
which way do you march?

636
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,490
So if you have an upper
triangular problem,

637
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:57,620
suppose I gave you
the problem, let

638
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,050
me make it upper triangular.

639
00:37:59,050 --> 00:37:59,570
So x+y+z=7.

640
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:03,420


641
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,760
2y+3z=12 and z=17.

642
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,640


643
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,980
So that's upper triangular.

644
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,150
Where do we start
in solving that one?

645
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,490
From the bottom.

646
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,930
From the right-hand
end, the bottom.

647
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:25,150
And we march backwards in time.

648
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:29,490
And what I was saying
about A, well L times U,

649
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,910
yeah, this is worth seeing.

650
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:38,840
What I was saying about A=LU,
it was, you remember that?

651
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,070
Those letters?

652
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:45,030
What that was saying was
that this matrix that's

653
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:51,900
looking both ways can be written
as a product of a matrix L

654
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:59,030
that looks behind for old values
and you can go forward with it.

655
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:05,020
And a matrix U, like this one,
this upper triangular, 1, 1, 1,

656
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:10,920
zeroes below that diagonal,
that you go backward with.

657
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,750
Somehow that's appealing.

658
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:18,590
That's like aesthetic to
break up a two-way problem

659
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:24,140
into a problem that marches
one way and then the other.

660
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:28,530
And of course, that's
what elimination aims for,

661
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:33,190
is this problem that it can
solve by, the words would be,

662
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,030
back substitution.

663
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,390
When you've started with
your original problem, got

664
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:42,020
to this one, then you just
have a back substitution,

665
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,880
you go backwards.

666
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,030
Oh, so much, I'll mention
the Kalman filter.

667
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:53,510
That's a similar process
of going forward,

668
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,120
that's called prediction.

669
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,410
Going backward, that's
called smoothing.

670
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,750
And so, Kalman
had the great idea

671
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:05,640
that he could break
these problems that

672
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:14,030
were fundamental in
space computations

673
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:19,350
into prediction and smoothing.

674
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,870
Once again, we've got off.

675
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:25,630
Yes?

676
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,420
Oh, the beam.

677
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:33,520
Let me help you even
more before the question.

678
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,070
I said it's better to
draw the beam this way.

679
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,270
I like the beam better this way.

680
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:46,310
Because the point of the beam
problem is loads are acting --

681
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,360
and we'll see this,
of course, later --

682
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:54,860
loads are acting perpendicular
to the direction of the beam.

683
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,010
That's why the beam bends.

684
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,460
So it'll bend a little, right?

685
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,250
And that is what leads
us, its bending moments

686
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,820
and other stuff.

687
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,900
If you haven't met
beams, well, it'll

688
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,840
be great to just have a
very, half a lecture about,

689
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,800
or maybe a lecture about beams.

690
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,860
That gives a fourth
order equation

691
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,560
that I'll write down again.

692
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,970
Fourth derivative
equal the load.

693
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:39,630
Now, ready.

694
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,990
Yeah, now here I don't
have the negative sign.

695
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:47,170
Because once I've got
second derivatives twice,

696
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:52,520
so the second derivative
is, in some way, negative.

697
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,090
I'll complete that
sentence in a second.

698
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,380
Somehow the second
derivative, which

699
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:02,540
is the guy that has the
1, -2, 1, somehow that's

700
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,340
a negative thing.

701
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,310
But fourth derivative
is second derivative

702
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,670
of the second derivative.

703
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,560
Yeah, do you want to tell me
what the numbers would be?

704
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,640
As long as we're wildly looking
forward to fourth derivatives,

705
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,260
just, it helps.

706
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:28,320
Do you want to guess what will
a typical row of the matrix B

707
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,830
when I go to finite
differences, fourth differences?

708
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:36,130
Probably you've never
seen a fourth difference.

709
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,710
You may not have seen
second differences before.

710
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:43,240
That was a big deal, then, to
introduce second differences.

711
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,050
Those 1, -2, 1's.

712
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,600
That was second differences.

713
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,520
Fourth?

714
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,270
Yeah, 1, 4, 6, 4,
1 with minus sign.

715
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:58,290
1, -4, 6, -4, and 1.

716
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:06,190
In some way, I would get
that by squaring this guy.

717
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:17,710
So that would be a
fourth difference.

718
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,880
Oh, what's the deal with
boundary conditions?

719
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:25,070
What are you figuring,
on beams, beam problems,

720
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,630
for a fourth order equation
and a matrix that's

721
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,430
stretching out further.

722
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,670
What's going to happen at
the left-hand boundary?

723
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,970
I guess my specific question
is, how many boundary conditions

724
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,580
do I now need?

725
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,740
Four.

726
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,880
And the typical is
two at each end.

727
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,400
That's the balanced way.

728
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,630
That's the way that would make
this matrix sort of symmetric.

729
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:56,540
So maybe at this end I
say it's held at zero

730
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,250
and maybe it's just
sitting on a log there.

731
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,260
Right?

732
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:06,900
That boundary condition I
would call simply supported.

733
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,420
That boundary condition
says that u(0)=0.

734
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,510
Because it's sitting there.

735
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:17,150
And but the slope
doesn't have to be zero.

736
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:20,590
What does have to be zero there?

737
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:23,560
Yeah, sort of the
bending moment.

738
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,780
Nobody's here
twisting it, right?

739
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,840
So the other condition
in that picture

740
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:36,140
would be second
derivative equal zero.

741
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:42,360
Maybe my point is that now
you see what I said before,

742
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,830
that getting the boundary
conditions into the problem

743
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,130
is often the hardest part.

744
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,730
Because I have to
replace u(0)=0,

745
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,550
that shouldn't be
too hard to do.

746
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:57,430
But I have to use this
other condition somehow,

747
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:01,820
it's going to screw up
the 1, -4, 6, -4, 1.

748
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:06,140
I'll have two boundary
rows at the top,

749
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,940
two boundary rows at the bottom.

750
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,860
I don't want to
go further today.

751
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,430
But I think maybe
just mentioning

752
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:19,910
this gives you the
picture of sort

753
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:23,490
of the how things fit together.

754
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:28,150
We would still have some
nice constant diagonals

755
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:29,610
in the middle,
but now we'll have

756
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,040
two boundary rows at each end.

757
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,750
So that's something to come.

758
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:44,980
Yes, now back to reality,
which is, any questions?

759
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:52,540
Lower triangular guy, yeah.

760
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:56,380
What do I mean by
marching forward?

761
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,240
So let's see.

762
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,600
I'll replace this.

763
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,310
Let's see it better.

764
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:11,500
I would replace this by maybe
u, I'll use a different letter,

765
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,830
n+1.

766
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:26,360
At u_(n+1)-2u_n+u_(n-1)
is some right-hand side

767
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,890
if there's a force
acting on my thing.

768
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:32,390
So f_n maybe.

769
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:37,730
By marching forward, I just
mean that this equation--

770
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,360
that I can go in order.

771
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,290
I can start with u_0 and u_1.

772
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:47,410
They come from the
boundary conditions.

773
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:51,880
Then this equation
will tell me u_2.

774
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,470
I use the equation.

775
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:54,790
With n as one.

776
00:46:54,790 --> 00:47:01,490
This says u_2, some u_1's, some
u_0's, f_1's, all that I know.

777
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:07,450
In other words, once I get
started, I'm on a roll.

778
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,520
If I have two boundary
conditions to get me started,

779
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,120
then the equation tells me u_2.

780
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:21,240
And then the next time,
u_3-2u_2+u_1, I can find u_3.

781
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,710
So I can get those,
I can go forever.

782
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:28,790
If you give me enough to
start on, two things to start,

783
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:32,630
then I march forward.

784
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:37,120
Whereas in our problems, we've
only got one thing to start on

785
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,400
and we've got one goal to hit.

786
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,090
And that's why we have to solve
the whole system together.

787
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:48,600
This is, we can solve
it step-by-step.

788
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,930
This is way faster of course.

789
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:57,550
To be able to just
go forward in time.

790
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:01,550
I'll mention that the topic
of initial value problems

791
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:07,590
and finite differences for
them, we can't get to that.

792
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:10,370
So we're seeing a
little bit here,

793
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:16,740
but it's done properly in
18.086 in the second semester

794
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:20,620
is the initial value
problem start part.

795
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:27,610
And that has it's own
interesting questions.

796
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:33,310
Somehow we've talked about
fourth order equations,

797
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:39,240
initial value problems.

798
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,100
But no homework problems.

799
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:46,280
So I'm ready for,
or even related.

800
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,790
But that's fine with me.

801
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,730
Is there a question?

802
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,400
Yeah, thanks.

803
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,858
Or it doesn't have
to be a homework

804
00:48:55,858 --> 00:49:05,350
question, another question.

805
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,240
Oh, good question.

806
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,210
You mean I should just
send the homework out

807
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:13,430
to Natick where MATLAB is.

808
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:16,420
Do you know that MATLAB
is just 15 miles away?

809
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:22,410
I almost get there, I
live 2/3 of the way there.

810
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:25,370
Yeah, so we could just send
the whole thing out there

811
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:27,940
and get it back.

812
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:36,150
That would save a lot of work.

813
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,050
I suppose, I'm okay.

814
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,400
Why should I say no?

815
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,410
Anything MATLAB can do
and you can make it do,

816
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,060
I'm okay with that.

817
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,270
I don't see that you have to
do things by hand if you've

818
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:50,180
got a better way.

819
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:50,780
That's okay.

820
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,560
And then probably the
answer gets printed

821
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,390
and you can graph it.

822
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,960
So that's fine.

823
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:03,020
So I mean, somehow a course like
this has got two parts to it.

824
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,010
Applied math has
two parts to it.

825
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:08,830
The modeling part, set up the
equation, think, what is it

826
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,260
you're supposed to do.

827
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,080
And then, step two is do it.

828
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,390
The numerical part,
the computing part.

829
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:19,620
And that's where MATLAB,
Python, Fortran, whatever,

830
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:25,220
is going to do a lot
of the heavy lifting.

831
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,390
Was there another question?

832
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:34,330
So that first
homework was certainly

833
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:35,930
very general intentionally.

834
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:40,610
Because I'm hoping you
will read the book.

835
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:46,820
The lecture, you'll be
able to match the lectures

836
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,100
with the book even later
on when they separate

837
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,004
a little or separate more.

838
00:50:54,004 --> 00:50:55,170
You'll see what we're doing.

839
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:58,350
And those, the
homework problems,

840
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,380
you should look at some
of the others just to see.

841
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,860
Do I know how to do that?

842
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,810
Right.

843
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:08,010
Let's stop here for
this first review.

844
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,620
I'm sure we'll have more--
questions will build up

845
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,870
for the second week.
