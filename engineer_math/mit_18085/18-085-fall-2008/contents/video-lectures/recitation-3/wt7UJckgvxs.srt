00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:26,840
PROFESSOR STRANG: Shall we just
start on this review session?

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,200
So, any questions on
anything from Chapter one,

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,050
anything from those first seven
lectures is very, very welcome.

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:41,410
So this morning finished
the serious part

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,880
of what we'll do in the
chapter with positive definite

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,040
matrices.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,460
And we'll see a lot
of those fortunately.

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,050
They're the best.

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,110
So questions about, I
hope you look in the book,

18
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,770
at other problems
in the problem sets

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,880
as well as the ones I suggest.

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,090
And then I can, anyway.

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,600
Ready for any questions.

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,930
Okay.

23
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,140
Which problem is it?

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,740
In section?

25
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,920
Section 1.6, problem 27,
what have I done there?

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,310
Oh, okay, that's good.

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,790
So it's about positive
definite matrices.

28
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,890
May I just put on the board
what the central question is?

29
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,270
Just put these matrices up.

30
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,910
We're given that H and
K are positive definite.

31
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,010
And then the question is, what
about these block matrices.

32
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,290
Do I call them M and N?

33
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,630
One is the block matrix
that looks like that.

34
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,600
And another one is the block
matrix that looks like this.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,330
So those are both symmetric.

36
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,739
We're allowed to ask,
are they positive

37
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:08,530
definite or negative
definite, because they

38
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,060
passed the first requirement.

39
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,810
They're symmetric.

40
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,410
We can discuss them.

41
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,620
Because of course H and
K each were symmetric.

42
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,530
The transpose of this would
bring K transpose down here,

43
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,220
but that's K, so all good.

44
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:32,520
So the question now.

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:43,030
Of these guys to those
guys I guess, yes.

46
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,210
Good question.

47
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,260
So this guy has, let's
take eigenvalues first.

48
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,700
So this guy has
some eigenvalues,

49
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,000
say lambda_1 to lambda_n.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,650
And this guy, we'll
suppose they're

51
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,230
the same size, so
they don't have to be.

52
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,490
Maybe I shouldn't, but I will.

53
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:05,410
This has some other
eigenvalues, maybe

54
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,080
e_1 to e_n for eigenvalue.

55
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,780
And then the question is, okay,
what about the eigenvalues

56
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,930
of that combination?

57
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,810
And what about this?

58
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,040
So it's a good question,
I think for all of us

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,840
to practice what just
came up in the lecture.

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,150
The idea of block matrices.

61
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:36,970
So looking here at eigenvalues
I could also look at pivots.

62
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,530
Pivots would be interesting
to look at, too.

63
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,910
Maybe I'll start with pivots.

64
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,700
Can I?

65
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,510
Did you think?

66
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,970
What would be the pivots of M?

67
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:51,950
If I start elimination on M
what will I see for pivots?

68
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:57,670
Well, I start up in the usual
left-hand corner and work down.

69
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,190
So what am I going to see first?

70
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,130
I'm going to see the pivots
of H. It won't even know,

71
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,860
by the time I had halfway there,
it won't even have seen K.

72
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,680
And then, that'll be fine.

73
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,100
And then this will be,
what's going to happen?

74
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,160
This is all zeroes.

75
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,360
So never get touched, right?

76
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:26,080
So when I get down to the second
half I see all zeroes here.

77
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,250
K is still going to be
sitting right there.

78
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,320
Nothing happened.

79
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,390
Because when I did these
eliminations nothing changed

80
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,970
with K. So the
rest of the pivots

81
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,210
will be the pivots of K. Good.

82
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,900
Now, we might hope for the
same thing with eigenvalues

83
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,720
and probably that's
going to happen.

84
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,430
This is like a diagonal matrix.

85
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,610
And actually, what
words would I use?

86
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,000
Block diagonal.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,560
I'd call that matrix
block diagonal.

88
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,040
And those are very
nice matrices.

89
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,030
That tells us that
the big matrix,

90
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,690
for all practical
purposes, is breaking up

91
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,390
into these smaller blocks.

92
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,270
Actually MATLAB will
search for a way

93
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,930
to reorder the rows and columns
to get that in case it's

94
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,870
possible.

95
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,730
So here it's in front of us.

96
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,100
Let's see if we can figure out.

97
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:31,330
That lambda_1, I believe,
is also an eigenvalue of M.

98
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,530
So it was an eigenvalue
of H. So that this,

99
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,560
the fact that it has that
eigenvalue lambda_1 means what?

100
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:48,160
That H times this times some
vector y is lambda_1*y, right?

101
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,210
If that's an eigenvalue
it's got an eigenvector

102
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,270
and let's call it y.

103
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,720
Now this is a good question.

104
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,630
I believe this block matrix
also has eigenvalue lambda_1,

105
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,670
and what's its eigenvector?

106
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:08,830
What could I
multiply M by to get

107
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,040
lambda_1 times the same thing?

108
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,050
Can you see what?

109
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,620
Of course I'm thinking
that y is going to help

110
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,460
but it's grown now.

111
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,830
So what would be the
eigenvector here?

112
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,950
When I multiply by M
it'll just come out right

113
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:33,840
with the same eigenvalue?
y_1, or y rather, and then?

114
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,540
And then zero, good. [y; 0].

115
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,210
Because if I multiply, can
I put in what M really is?

116
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,990
The H and K. H there, K there.

117
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,300
When I do that multiplication
I get lambda_1*y.

118
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,850
When I do this
multiplication, see I've just,

119
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,290
that's a zero block,
zero, so I got a zero.

120
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,620
Perfect.

121
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:05,510
So the eigenvectors of H just
sit with a zero in the K part

122
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,730
and produce an
eigenvector of the block

123
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,260
matrix with the same lambda_1.

124
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,060
So you can see then, we
get the whole picture.

125
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,870
The eigenvalues are
just sitting there

126
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,240
and the eigenvectors are there.

127
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,170
Now maybe you got all
that and wanted-- well

128
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,450
I haven't said anything
about N, Sorry.

129
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:31,750
Everybody thinks more about
N. So what's the thing with N?

130
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,000
What would you say about N?

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,400
If you look at that matrix,
suppose I don't even tell you

132
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,270
it's positive definite
at first, would you

133
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,080
say that looks like a
invertible or singular matrix?

134
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,550
Everybody's going
to say singular.

135
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:55,040
And why would you
say that's singular?

136
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:05,160
Well, the determinant of a block
matrix, this morning I said

137
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,420
do whatever you like
with block matrices.

138
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:13,890
But I have to admit that if I
had a bunch of general blocks,

139
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:17,270
if I had to take the determinant
of that, and of course

140
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,830
everybody's remembering
Professor Strang doesn't like

141
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,250
determinants, if I had
to take the determinant,

142
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,940
I'd have to do the whole thing.

143
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,900
The separate determinants would
not tell me the story, usually.

144
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,990
So determinants
are a bit tricky.

145
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,700
But up here the determinant
will come out zero.

146
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:45,460
I guess what I would hope your
internal test for a singular

147
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,050
matrix is, are the
columns independent?

148
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,280
And then the matrix
is invertible.

149
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,710
Or are they dependent?

150
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:59,070
Do you have some
columns that are

151
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,860
in the same direction as
other columns, same direction

152
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,910
as combinations
of other columns?

153
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,640
If you look at the columns
of that, say column one,

154
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,150
so column one is the first
column of K repeated.

155
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,290
What do you think about the
columns of that matrix, that

156
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,540
block matrix N?

157
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,200
Do you see that same
column showing up again?

158
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,550
Yeah.

159
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,760
That very same column, which
is the first column of K,

160
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,970
again twice, is going to show up
right there, first column of K

161
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,880
again.

162
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,140
So this matrix has
two identical columns.

163
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,370
No way it could be invertible.

164
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,650
And in fact, you can
tell me what vector,

165
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,810
I'm always saying are
the columns independent?

166
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,870
Here, no, they're dependent.

167
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:56,600
And then you can tell me an x.

168
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,640
So this is my block
matrix N. I want

169
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:06,830
to know an x so that
the result is zero.

170
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:13,880
That's really my
same indication.

171
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,830
We found two identical columns.

172
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,640
What would be the x?

173
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,970
Well, you have to tell me
more than one, minus one

174
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:30,790
because I've got a big x there.

175
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,360
Yeah I've gotta
make it big enough,

176
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,620
but essentially it's the
one, minus one, thanks.

177
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,930
And enough zeroes in there
and enough zeroes in there.

178
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:45,210
So the fact that that
vector gets taken to zero

179
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,700
is the same thing as saying that
one of this column minus one

180
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,810
of this column gives zero.

181
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,900
In other words, the
columns are the same.

182
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,770
And of course, by
doing this we're

183
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:01,010
seeing the one and minus one
could have gone into position

184
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,950
two there, position three.

185
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,140
So we've got a whole
bunch of vectors.

186
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:13,860
This matrix N, this [K, K; K, K]
has got a whole lot of vectors

187
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,610
that it takes to zero.

188
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,850
What I would say it
has a large null space.

189
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,510
A large space of vectors
that it takes to zero.

190
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,290
So that's a really
useful exercise.

191
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,440
I'm delighted you asked it.

192
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:34,050
Now I'm ready for more.

193
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:34,850
Could do.

194
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,060
Exactly, row reduction.

195
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,740
I should look to see what
would happen in elimination.

196
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,470
Well, elimination would
go swimmingly along

197
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,200
for the first part because
it's only looking here.

198
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:56,390
But then what would I have after
the first half of elimination?

199
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:04,012
Well I'd have I suppose whatever
that K changed to, elimination.

200
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:04,970
What should we call it?

201
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,360
U or something?

202
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,950
When I did these row
steps that matrix

203
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,360
turned into this upper
triangular matrix.

204
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,110
And maybe you can tell me
what will have happened

205
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,900
at the same time to the rest?

206
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,990
What will I see sitting here if
I just do ordinary elimination

207
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,470
and I'm just looking
there and using the pivots

208
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,720
and so on, I'll see?

209
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,470
It'll be U because whenever
I do on the left side

210
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,410
I'm doing to the whole row.

211
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,100
And now, the main point
is, what will I see?

212
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,970
Now elimination, keep
going, keep going.

213
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,920
Do elimination to
clear out this column,

214
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,020
this whole bunch, right?

215
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,110
Elimination.

216
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,700
And now what am I going
to see in that corner?

217
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,980
All zeroes, right.

218
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:05,910
So that's telling me
that the matrix has just

219
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:11,070
got half of the eigenvalues
positive, half of the pivots

220
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,000
are positive.

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,700
The second half all zeroes.

222
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,490
So I guess, here I've
found an eigenvector

223
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,330
with what eigenvalue?

224
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,720
That's looking like
an eigenvector to me

225
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
if we're thinking eigenvectors.

226
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,050
And what's the eigenvalue
that goes with it?

227
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:30,730
Zero.

228
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,150
Because Nx is 0x.

229
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,680
You can either think of it as
Nx=0 if you're thinking about

230
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,200
systems of equations.

231
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,860
Or Nx=0x if you're thinking that
that guy is an eigenvector with

232
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,550
eigenvalue zero.

233
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,230
So I'm pretty happy.

234
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,370
I mean many of you
will have spotted this.

235
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,640
Probably perhaps all.

236
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,250
But I'm happy that's
an example that

237
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,870
just shows how you
have to think big

238
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,690
with block matrices I guess.

239
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,030
Good.

240
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,470
Okay on that?

241
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:27,231
What else, thanks.

242
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:27,730
That's true.

243
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,530
And that's really all I've done
so far is those four examples.

244
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,910
I think that language of
fixed-fixed and fixed-free

245
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,180
really comes, I mean I used
it early about those four

246
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,680
matrices, but it's
really going to show up

247
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,670
at the next lecture,
Friday, when

248
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:53,170
I have a line of springs and the
matrices that come out of that.

249
00:14:53,170 --> 00:15:00,050
So Friday we'll finally
be on those first four.

250
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,500
A fifth matrix will appear
in this course finally.

251
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,770
Of course, it's going to be
related to the first ones,

252
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:14,630
naturally, but we'll move
to, we'll see something new

253
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,860
and then we'll see the
fixed-free idea again

254
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,780
for those.

255
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,965
So if that can
wait until Friday,

256
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:24,160
you'll see some different ones.

257
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,320
Good.

258
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,680
Questions, thoughts.

259
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,110
You can ask about anything.

260
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,720
Maybe I can ask.

261
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,660
Any thoughts about the
pace of the course?

262
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:49,640
This is sort of a heavy dose
of linear algebra, right?

263
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,320
Of course, the answer
maybe depends on how much

264
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,160
you had seen before.

265
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,920
So those who haven't seen very
much linear algebra at all

266
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,950
really got quite a
bit quickly here.

267
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,940
Because many courses
on linear algebra

268
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:12,620
never reach this key idea
of positive definiteness

269
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,980
that ties it all together.

270
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,620
So you've seen
quite a bit, really.

271
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,040
Of course, we've concentrated
on symmetric matrices

272
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,790
and there's a whole
garden or forest or zoo

273
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,870
of matrices of different types.

274
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,720
So what matrices have we seen?

275
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,760
Symmetric matrices and
then their eigenvectors

276
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,130
were orthogonal and we
could say orthonormal.

277
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,990
So that gave us, I
don't know if you

278
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:53,650
remember this part, which
when we wrote it down I said,

279
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,860
big deal.

280
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,370
That's very important.

281
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,750
That's this principal
axis theorem.

282
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,810
These Q's, what kind
of a matrix is Q?

283
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,730
It's the eigenvector matrix.

284
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:12,370
And for symmetric matrix, so
this is the eigenvector matrix.

285
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,820
And what do we know about it?

286
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:22,540
In the special case
of symmetric K?

287
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,260
What do we know especially
about the eigenvectors then?

288
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,440
They're orthogonal.

289
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,890
We can make them orthonormal.

290
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,710
So this will be an
orthogonal matrix.

291
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,040
And that was a matrix
with Q transpose

292
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,400
was the same as Q inverse.

293
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,410
Normally we would see
the inverse there,

294
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:47,350
but for these we can
put the transpose.

295
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,140
Here's one type of matrix,
symmetric, very important.

296
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,120
Here's another type of
matrix, orthogonal matrices.

297
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,550
And of course, many,
many other varieties.

298
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,610
Well here we have
a very nice matrix,

299
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,870
so that matrix is diagonal.

300
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,380
Right, that's just
the eigenvalues,

301
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,710
so that's a diagonal matrix.

302
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,350
And what do we know, if K is
positive definite, let's just,

303
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,690
this was for any symmetric one.

304
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,020
So what's special if K
is positive definite?

305
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,860
Somehow the positive
definiteness

306
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,820
should show up here.

307
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,520
And where does it show?

308
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,150
Positive eigenvalues, exactly.

309
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:33,790
The Q could be any,
any Q would be fine.

310
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,710
But we would see
positive eigenvalues.

311
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,760
Oh, here's a little
point about eigenvalues.

312
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,080
Suppose I have my matrix K.
And it's got some eigenvalues.

313
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:57,220
Now let me add four
times the identity to it.

314
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,320
What are the eigenvalues now?

315
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,230
What are the eigenvectors now?

316
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:08,710
What's changed and how
and what hasn't changed?

317
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,710
Because that's a pretty
easy, the identity matrix

318
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,910
is always the easy one for
us to know what's happening.

319
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:20,270
So what is happening
to the eigenvalues now?

320
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,380
If K had these
eigenvalues lambda,

321
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,010
what are the
eigenvalues of K+4I?

322
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:31,010


323
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,849
You add?

324
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:32,640
You add four, yeah.

325
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,620
The eigenvalues of this are
the eigenvalues of K plus four.

326
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,830
That is just like
shifting the matrix,

327
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,630
you could think of
it is adding four

328
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,340
along the diagonal
will add four.

329
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:54,300
And the eigenvectors would
be exactly the same ones.

330
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,570
I would have Kx would
agree with lambda*x.

331
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,440
And 4Ix would agree with 4x.

332
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,250
So that proves it.

333
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:11,680
Good to see what you can do,
the limited number of things

334
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,640
that you're allowed
to do without changing

335
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,300
the eigenvectors, and therefore
you can spot the eigenvalues

336
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,280
right away.

337
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,330
The limited things
you can invert,

338
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,820
you can shift like this, you
could square it, cube it,

339
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:34,530
take powers, things like that.

340
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:38,200
I'm going to look to you now for
giving me a lead on something

341
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,960
that is interesting or not.

342
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,120
Yes, thanks.

343
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,900
Go ahead.

344
00:20:52,900 --> 00:21:02,700
Oh, I see okay, yes.

345
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,540
I see.

346
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,370
Alright.

347
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,350
So that's page 64 of the book.

348
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:18,220
Well, so that's a problem
that physicists love.

349
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,360
I don't know how much I
can say about it here,

350
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,010
to tell the truth.

351
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,300
Just to mention.

352
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,730
Do they use a minus sign?

353
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,230
Probably they do.

354
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:40,120
So their equation is minus the
second derivative of u plus (x

355
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:46,460
squared)*u, and they are
interested in the eigenvalues,

356
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:54,080
equal lambda*u.

357
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,880
The case that we've done in
class was without this (x

358
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,680
squared)*u term, right?

359
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,600
The absolutely most important
case is the second derivative

360
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,990
of u equal lambda*u.

361
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,300
The eigenvalues
were, or what were

362
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,740
the eigenvectors in that case?

363
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:21,070
What were the eigenvectors of
the second derivative before

364
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:27,760
there was any (x squared)*u,
any potential showing up?

365
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,760
They were just sines
and cosines, right?

366
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,690
Sines and cosines
have the property

367
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,600
that if you take two
derivatives you get them back

368
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,330
with some factor lambda.

369
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,680
Now let me just
look at that problem

370
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,550
without saying much about it.

371
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,920
First of all, the first
thing I want to know

372
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,250
is have I got a
linear problem here?

373
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,740
Have I got a linear equation?

374
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,730
Because that's where I
talk about eigenvalues.

375
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,120
So in the matrix case,
I'd say I have a matrix.

376
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,550
K times an eigenvector.

377
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:14,210
That matrix represents
something linear.

378
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:18,280
It's just, all the rules
of addition work here.

379
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,310
Here it is linear.

380
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:27,110
It is linear.

381
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:33,570
What I'm trying
to say is, I just

382
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,330
call that a variable coefficient
and that's what we're

383
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,480
going to see in Chapter two.

384
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,090
The material or something could
lead to some dependence on x.

385
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:49,810
But u is still
there, just linearly.

386
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:55,520
In other words, this is a
perfectly okay linear operator

387
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,100
and am I imagining that
it's positive definite?

388
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,900
Let's see.

389
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:08,090
This part with the minus sign
was positive definite, right?

390
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,100
Well, at least semi-definite.

391
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,660
So let me just remember
the most important case.

392
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,720
If I look at this equation,
d second u/dx squared equals

393
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,970
lambda*u.

394
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:28,550
So that's the eigenvalue,
eigenfunction problem

395
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,990
for our good friend.

396
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,570
What do I say about
the eigenvalues now?

397
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:40,010
What can you tell me about
the eigenvalues of that?

398
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,160
Mostly positive.

399
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,680
Because they were
sort of omega squares.

400
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,510
But I mean zero could
be an eigenvalue, right?

401
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:55,620
What would the eigenfunction
be for lambda equal zero?

402
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,330
If I wanted to get
zero here, if I

403
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,990
wanted a zero on the right
side, what functions u

404
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,780
could give me zero?

405
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,840
Constant function.

406
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,250
Yeah, the constant
function is certainly there

407
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,030
as a possibility.

408
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:19,490
But anyway, I would say this
is positive semi-definite

409
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,820
at least.

410
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,150
And this part?

411
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,290
How do I think about
that as a big matrix?

412
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,670
I think of it sort of like
a big matrix with x squared

413
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:36,060
running down the diagonal.

414
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,800
With a matrix, you could say
walking down the diagonal

415
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,670
because it's n steps.

416
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:45,300
For differential
equations, maybe running

417
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,420
is the right word.

418
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:53,250
Because it doesn't jump,
it's just bzzz all the way

419
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,250
from zero squared to whatever.

420
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:05,430
Anyway, that would correspond
to a diagonal matrix, but not

421
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,490
constant diagonal.

422
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,070
Diagonal, but not
constant diagonal.

423
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,150
Because this x squared
number is changing.

424
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,590
It's like a spring,
it's like a bunch

425
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:22,730
of springs in which
the first spring maybe

426
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,940
has a spring constant of one.

427
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,840
And then we have a tighter
spring and then a very tight

428
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,400
spring and so on, more and
more, higher and higher

429
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,720
constants there.

430
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Well, I'm just speaking
very roughly here.

431
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,490
Because variable coefficient,
variable material properties,

432
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,800
springs of different
elasticities,

433
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,810
we're ready to move to that.

434
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:57,720
Our problems up to now, the
springs were all the same.

435
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,270
The bar, if it was
a bar, was uniform.

436
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:05,380
And now this would
be a step forward.

437
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,840
But now, of course,
this specific problem

438
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,060
just happens to have a
solution that physicists love.

439
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,590
It has a meaning to
physicists, not to me.

440
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,080
And the eigenfunctions
have a meaning

441
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,450
and they're famous functions.

442
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,100
It's just glorious.

443
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,510
So you could say that's the
special problem, the way we

444
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,540
had four special
matrices in 18.085,

445
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:44,310
that would be a similar special
problem in quantum mechanics.

446
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:48,390
Let's turn to something
entirely different.

447
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,590
Questions about any topic.

448
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,900
Or I can ask some and
you can take this, maybe

449
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,350
that's one way to review.

450
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,020
Go ahead.

451
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,010
Thanks.

452
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,570
Number 20 of 1.6.

453
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,360
1.6 is a section, oh, no.

454
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,930
That's positive definite
notes so I'm okay with that.

455
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,590
I see that I did ask you
a question on the homework

456
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:22,320
from 1.7 which I may not
get to cover in lecture,

457
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,900
but give it a shot anyway.

458
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,620
So what's 20?

459
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,620
Oh, okay, that's good.

460
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,570
Without multiplying
out the matrix.

461
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,120
So it's this
Q*lambda*Q transpose.

462
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,680
So I'm telling you
in that question what

463
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,040
Q, lambda, and Q transpose are.

464
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:53,970
The Q is this [cosine, minus
 sine; sine, cosine].

465
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,940
The lambda is two and five,
I think, in that question.

466
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,240
And the Q transpose of course
is [cosine, sine; minus sine,

467
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,310
cosine].

468
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:12,100
And if I've told you that
those are the numbers then you

469
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:18,060
could multiply those together
to get K. But you can tell me,

470
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,140
this is like K exposed.

471
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:27,070
The matrix is like, we're
told more than we would know.

472
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,990
If I multiply it all
together, I wouldn't

473
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,620
see that the eigenvectors
are these guys,

474
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,990
that the eigenvalues
are these guys.

475
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:41,960
So what, without
looking to see, what

476
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,370
are the eigenvalues
of this matrix K if we

477
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,810
multiplied it all together?

478
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:49,930
What would the
eigenvalues actually be?

479
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:53,640
Two and five, right, because
we built it up that way.

480
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,520
What would the determinant be?

481
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,930
Now what do we know
about determinants?

482
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,600
It would be ten is
the right answer.

483
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,810
What's the right
way to see that?

484
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:10,113
Well, the determinant is always
the product of the eigenvalues,

485
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:11,720
isn't it?

486
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,100
These guys have
determinant ten anyway.

487
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,620
And if I hadn't normalized,
so this had some bigger

488
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:23,130
determinant, this would have
some smaller determinant.

489
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,080
Their inverses,
their determinants

490
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,210
will give me the one
and there's the ten.

491
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:33,360
What else could I ask about
or did I ask about for that?

492
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,250
The eigenvectors, okay.

493
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,720
The eigenvectors of the
matrix, what are they?

494
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,210
They're these columns that
are sitting here for us,

495
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,290
they're those two
columns, right.

496
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:49,470
And would you like to just
check that if the-- I believe

497
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,450
that column is an eigenvector.

498
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:56,260
And which do you think, two
or five, is its eigenvalue?

499
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,080
That goes with
this first column.

500
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,510
Everybody's going to say
two and that's right.

501
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:08,120
And do you want me to just take
that matrix times this proposed

502
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,340
eigenvector and just see
if it's going to work?

503
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:17,390
Suppose I just do
all and just see,

504
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,340
sure enough this will
be an eigenvector.

505
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,100
So what do I have at this point?

506
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,010
Can you do this
times this first?

507
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:31,840
What do I get? c squared
plus s squared is one.

508
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,050
And -cs plus cs is zero.

509
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,720
So at that point I have [1, 0].

510
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,140
Now comes this matrix.

511
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:46,630
So what do I have after that
matrix speaks up? [2, 0].

512
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:51,310
And now I take two times
this and what do I get?

513
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:55,260
Or that matrix times the [2, 0].

514
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,142
How do you multiply a matrix
times that [2, 0] vector.

515
00:31:59,142 --> 00:32:00,600
Here's the good
way to think of it.

516
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,240
It's two times the first column.

517
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,430
And zero times the second.

518
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,160
So the net result
of the whole deal

519
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,810
was two times that first column.

520
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,640
Which is exactly saying
that this is an eigenvector.

521
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,350
When I did all that
it came back again.

522
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:24,770
Scaled by two.

523
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,100
So that's a good example.

524
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,260
And then, is the matrix
positive definite?

525
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,860
That connects to
today's lecture.

526
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,850
What test would you use
to show that the matrix is

527
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,110
positive definite?

528
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,700
The eigenvalues, yeah.

529
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,360
The eigenvalues
are sitting there.

530
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,410
Two and five, both positive.

531
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,760
If I changed one of those
signs, then it would no longer

532
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,780
be positive definite.

533
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,200
It would still be symmetric,
I'd still have the eigenvectors,

534
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:00,850
but the eigenvalue would
have jumped to minus five.

535
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,470
I think this sort of helps out.

536
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,570
I guess I hope that as
I'm doing these things,

537
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,230
you're ahead of me or
with me in the calculation

538
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,730
and you just have to
do a bunch of these

539
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,270
to get confidence that
you've got the right thing.

540
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:22,890
Okay, yes?

541
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,350
1.6, 24.

542
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,680
Is that also a homework problem?

543
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,200
Alright, but you guys are
reading the rest of the book,

544
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,720
right?

545
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,380
Not only the homework questions.

546
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,320
Ah.

547
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,050
Oh, dear.

548
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:41,100
24, that's a very good question.

549
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,370
About this, yeah.

550
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:54,650
Right.

551
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,850
It's a good question.

552
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,810
And if today's lecture had
been, well it ran a little late.

553
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:05,760
But if we ran another 20 minutes
late, I could have done this.

554
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,440
I'll just say what's
in that problem.

555
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:16,080
And then we'll see it again.

556
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:21,340
So what's in that question?

557
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,540
Let me write down what it is.

558
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:28,830
So I have a positive
definite matrix K, right?

559
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,580
And then I've got its energy.

560
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:39,980
I'm using u rather
than x, so let's use u.

561
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:46,110
So my u transpose Ku, or
like x transpose Kx today.

562
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:52,580
That is this bowl-shaped
figure, right?

563
00:34:52,580 --> 00:35:01,140
If I graph this on
the u_1, u_2 maybe up

564
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,780
to u_n, all in the base.

565
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,040
And now I have the picture.

566
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,550
So I'm in n+1 dimensions.

567
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,410
The other dimension is this one.

568
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:15,950
Then that's the one where I
might get this bowl-shaped guy.

569
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,930
And I've called that energy.

570
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:22,570
In many, many physical problems
there is a factor of 1/2.

571
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:27,810
And it's going to be nice
to have that factor of 1/2.

572
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:35,610
So that won't change
anything, just half as big.

573
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:41,630
So what is the minimum
value of that energy?

574
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:46,400
And what is the minimum value of
this, if I said minimize that,

575
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,040
you could do it right away.

576
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,570
It'd be a zero.

577
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:57,470
Now I'm going to
introduce a linear term.

578
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:01,030
This was a quadratic term
and it had u squareds in it.

579
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,980
So the linear term is
going to be u transpose f

580
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,652
is the shorthand for it.

581
00:36:06,652 --> 00:36:08,985
And of course, we all know
that that stands for u_1*f_1,

582
00:36:08,985 --> 00:36:16,540
u_2 all minus,
u_2*f_2 and so on.

583
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,760
However many dimensions I'm in.

584
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,660
You can imagine I'm
in two dimensions.

585
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,850
So it's -u_1*f_1 - u_2*f_2.

586
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:30,850


587
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:34,300
So what I'm saying is
that minimizing just this

588
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,720
was like, too easy, right?

589
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,650
The answer was zero.

590
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,810
Nobody's interested
in that for very long.

591
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,730
But now it is much
more interesting

592
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:48,380
when I get a linear
term in there.

593
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,680
So what happens now?

594
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,190
Well, the effect
of that linear term

595
00:36:54,190 --> 00:37:02,540
is to shift that bowl sorta
over and down a little.

596
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:09,590
So that instead of sitting where
I drew it, let me erase it.

597
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:14,870
If I now graph this function,
this is my function of u,

598
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:19,240
this is still the
most important part,

599
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,240
but now I have a
first order term.

600
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,130
And the result is, it
still goes through here.

601
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:27,630
Right?

602
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,800
Why does it still go
through that same point?

603
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,020
Because if I take u_1 and
u_2 to be zero, I get zero.

604
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,260
So I still get zero there.

605
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,500
But the bowl has shifted.

606
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,040
It's more like something here.

607
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,690
And it still has a minimum
because this is still

608
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,730
the all-important term.

609
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,900
But it's just moved
over and down.

610
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,360
So it has the minimum value.

611
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,550
It actually goes below
zero, but if I look at it

612
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,130
if I'm sitting at the
minimum and looking

613
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,730
I'm seeing a bowl
going up, right.

614
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:14,160
So I hope that picture shows--
And now, of course, that's

615
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,480
the geometry.

616
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,280
In other words, the
same geometry just

617
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,360
moved the thing over and down.

618
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,160
But the algebra is,
where is the minimum?

619
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,000
What is the value
of that minimum?

620
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:35,180
And this problem, 24, is
one way to do the minimum.

621
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,750
One way to do it.

622
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:42,060
But actually, if you
didn't like linear-- well

623
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,560
I won't say didn't like
linear algebra, that's

624
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
against my religion.

625
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,910
So if you like calculus and
you said, wait a minute,

626
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,170
if you give me something
you want me to minimize,

627
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,750
what will I do?

628
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,290
I'll set derivatives to zero.

629
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:03,920
And can I just
jump to the answer?

630
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:12,370
Oh, what derivatives do I set to
zero now, for the minimum here?

631
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,500
It's the first derivatives.

632
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:21,770
And they're first
derivatives with respect to?

633
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,330
I look at df/d what?

634
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,250
You see I've already
given it away.

635
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,060
These are going to be
partial derivatives.

636
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,950
Why's that?

637
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,390
Because I've got two directions.

638
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:36,200
So I have a df/du_1=0
and a df/du_2=0.

639
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,330


640
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,240
In other words, when I
sit here at the bottom

641
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,420
I'm seeing this
whole bowl above me.

642
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,920
If I go along the u_2
direction it should go up

643
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,450
and if I come along the
u_1 direction, goes up.

644
00:39:54,450 --> 00:40:00,700
But it's flat at the
bottom both ways.

645
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,320
So what's my point here?

646
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,560
If you like calculus,
you'll get to two equations.

647
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,540
And I just want to say
what those equations are,

648
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:19,230
because they're all important.

649
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:22,630
Suppose we only had
u_1 and nothing else.

650
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,530
Then this would just be a
parabola and the derivative

651
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,160
of this would be
at 1/2 K*u squared.

652
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,790
Suppose n is one.

653
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,530
I'm only in one.

654
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:39,410
So what's the derivative
of 1/2 K*u squared?

655
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,200
The derivative.

656
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,250
So I'm looking for, if this
was 1/2 K*u squared and I took

657
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,480
the derivative with
respect to u, it would be?

658
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,610
It'd be Ku.

659
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:52,130
And it works here
in the matrix case.

660
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:56,766
And what would be the derivative
of u, transpose of u times

661
00:40:56,766 --> 00:41:03,930
f, if u was just a number and
if u was just one thing and f

662
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:08,070
was a single number, the
derivative would be? f, yeah.

663
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:12,140
It'd be f.

664
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:18,560
That's the system.

665
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,400
I've jumped to the answer.

666
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,130
That this set of two or n
equations in matrix language

667
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:33,100
would just be, and I'll even
write it better as Ku=f.

668
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,960
That tells me where
the minimum is.

669
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,720
The minimizing guy is,
so this is in the base

670
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,680
and then the thing
is dropping down.

671
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,350
I still have to figure out
what's the bottom value.

672
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:54,290
But I've now identified
where the minimum occurs.

673
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,260
So you get two questions
about a minimum.

674
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,040
Where is it?

675
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,300
What value of u
gives the minimum?

676
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:09,240
And at that point, at that
lowest point, how low is it?

677
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,820
The one thing you've
gotta remember

678
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,910
is that when you
minimize that quadratic,

679
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,570
you get that system
of equations.

680
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,430
And then, of course, the answer,
you have to solve that system.

681
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,450
But this goes back
to what I said

682
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:29,260
at the first minute of today.

683
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:34,030
That we have two ways
of looking at a problem.

684
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:38,080
Usually we go directly
to the equations.

685
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:44,080
Sometimes the problem
comes naturally to us

686
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,520
as a minimum problem.

687
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,360
Like we have to
minimize the cost,

688
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:53,030
we want to build a new
school or something.

689
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,300
So we've got some
cost function that we

690
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,240
minimize that will lead, through
calculus or linear algebra,

691
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,980
to this.

692
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:14,680
So I've done everything
but answer the question 24.

693
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,770
We only checked
the one by one case

694
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:21,780
to see that that's
the right equations,

695
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,590
derivative equal zero.

696
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:27,710
And now you could use
calculus as I said.

697
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:36,220
But if I answer that question,
well let me just do a little.

698
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:41,120
The idea of that question
24, so that was what?

699
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,770
1.6, 24, or something.

700
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:46,740
Is that right?

701
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,770
Yeah.

702
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:55,130
Is that I could rewrite
this to make it clear.

703
00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:00,280
I think it's u
minus K inverse f,

704
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:07,560
transpose K times u
minus K inverse f.

705
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:17,230
And then a minus 1/2 f
transpose K inverse f.

706
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:21,060
Actually, my best friend in
China told me this trick.

707
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:25,600
And I didn't give him
credit for it in the book.

708
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,500
But I should have done.

709
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,560
I just think that if you
multiply all this out,

710
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,460
you'll get this.

711
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,980
It's what I would
call an identity.

712
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:40,190
That just simply means that
it's just true for every u.

713
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:42,230
It's true for everything.

714
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:45,700
Can I try to multiply
some of that out?

715
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:53,930
Just so you kind of see it.

716
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,060
Yeah, that's what I
mean, multiply it out.

717
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,330
You've got it.

718
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,870
This thing would
give me four terms.

719
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:05,140
It'd be this transpose
times that times that.

720
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,560
Which is my guy here.

721
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,270
And then I'll have something.

722
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,610
It's just like numbers.

723
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,350
Then this thing times
that times this.

724
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,700
And this thing times
that times that.

725
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,410
And this thing times
that times that.

726
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:19,760
Let me do that last one.

727
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:26,990
What happens when I do
the 1/2 and this transpose

728
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,880
times the K times this.

729
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,910
So I'm using the
distributive, whatever, laws.

730
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:35,960
Let's just do that
particular term

731
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,370
and see what we're getting.

732
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:42,380
So I have 1/2 of the minus
K inverse f transpose.

733
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,740
So how do I write that?

734
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,920
Shoot.

735
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,560
Well, it's something
times something transpose.

736
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,460
So what do I have to do?

737
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,890
Opposite order.

738
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,151
So I have a minus, an F
transpose and the K inverse

739
00:45:58,151 --> 00:45:58,650
transpose.

740
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,730
You're seeing all this stuff.

741
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:06,440
And then comes the K and
then comes the minus,

742
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,470
oh again the minus.

743
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:08,900
So that'd be a plus, right?

744
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,190
Times K inverse times f.

745
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,470
So that's one of the terms.

746
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:18,550
That's one of the
terms that shows up.

747
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:22,960
And what good is that one?

748
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,120
So that's one.

749
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,340
You could say that's
the longest term.

750
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,470
That's the one with
the messiest term.

751
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,900
But you can fix it.

752
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,670
What would you do with that?

753
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:37,350
K times K inverse is?

754
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,030
Identity.

755
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,390
So we can forget that.

756
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,210
And now we're there.

757
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,520
That's 1/2, f transpose,
f on this side.

758
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,200
Oh, what's K inverse transpose?

759
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,420
It's the same as K inverse
because K is symmetric,

760
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,850
so its inverse is symmetric.

761
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:57,880
So that transpose doesn't
change the matrix.

762
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:08,600
In other words, this term will
show up and this term is oh!

763
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,110
Nope, sorry.

764
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:13,030
I was going to goof here.

765
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,050
I was going to say this
is the same as this,

766
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,830
but it's not, right?

767
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,880
Why not?

768
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,610
Because it's positive.

769
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:24,470
And this guy is negative.

770
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:27,980
Has my good friend
Professor Lin messed up?

771
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,680
Nope.

772
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,890
What's going to happen now?

773
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:39,900
The two that I didn't
do, you see, the 1/2 u

774
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,070
transpose K u is here.

775
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:46,540
Then comes this
one, which I didn't

776
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,450
do, and then another
one that I didn't do,

777
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,760
and then this one that I did.

778
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,960
They'll all be the same.

779
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,600
So they'll all contribute with
their plus sign or minus sign

780
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:02,170
and the net result will
be a perfect match, yeah.

781
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:08,310
So I won't wear out your
patience by doing that.

782
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:11,590
But I do want to make the point.

783
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:16,880
What was Professor Lin's point
in suggesting to write it

784
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,010
in this more complicated way?

785
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:27,710
His point was we could see
this is just a constant.

786
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,860
Doesn't depend on u.

787
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:34,630
And now I can see what value
of u would make this as small

788
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:35,410
as possible.

789
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:38,260
Remember, I'm still
trying to minimize.

790
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:43,190
This part, I can't make it
bigger or smaller, it's fixed.

791
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,950
It's u that I can play with.

792
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:51,700
So what u should I choose
to make this part smaller?

793
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,180
Bear with me.

794
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:58,580
What u will make this big
mess as small as I can get it

795
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,850
and how small can I get it?

796
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:07,350
If I take u to be K inverse
f, then this is zero,

797
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:10,900
this is zero, I get zero.

798
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,060
And that's my claim, that u
equal K inverse f is the best

799
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,930
possible, is the minimizer.

800
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:21,460
And how do I know
that I can't make this

801
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:25,210
more negative than the zero?

802
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,790
I can get it down
to zero by making

803
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:31,900
that to be the zero vector.

804
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:41,090
But how do I know I
can't make it below zero?

805
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:44,090
The K is positive definite
and I'm sitting here

806
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:48,370
with some x
transpose and some x.

807
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:51,980
The x has this sort of
messy form but it's an x

808
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,690
and here's its transpose.

809
00:49:53,690 --> 00:50:00,070
So this is an x transpose Kx
and can't be brought below zero

810
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,230
when K is positive definite.

811
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:05,370
Good.

812
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:08,890
So we've said a good bit
about positive definite here,

813
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:19,970
but happy to think--
Yeah, thanks.

814
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:27,020
In fact, finally a fifth.

815
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,060
Exactly.

816
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,470
Thanks, perfect question.

817
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:33,070
And let me answer it clearly.

818
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:36,560
Each of those five
tests completely

819
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,760
decides positive definite.

820
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,590
So the five tests
are all equivalent.

821
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,760
If a matrix passes one
test, it passes all five.

822
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,140
So that's great, right?

823
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:52,700
So we just do
whichever test we want.

824
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,820
Or whichever way we want
to understand the matrix.

825
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:02,720
I was going to add, I didn't
say a lot about this one.

826
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:09,790
Can I just add a note
about a MATLAB command?

827
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:18,410
The command chol(K).

828
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:23,150
That's the first letters
in the name Cholesky.

829
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:28,450
So chol is the first four
letters of this name.

830
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:34,650
And that's a MATLAB command.

831
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:37,670
If I've defined a matrix
that's positive definite

832
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:42,470
and I use that command,
out will pop an A,

833
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,540
one particular A that works.

834
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:50,580
Out will pop an A
that makes this work.

835
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:55,060
It'll be a square A and
it'll be upper triangular.

836
00:51:55,060 --> 00:52:03,150
So out will pop, so this command
is very, very close to the LU

837
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:06,230
but it's just sort of
the appropriate version,

838
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:12,510
symmetrized version
of elimination

839
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:16,560
when you have a positive
definite symmetric matrix.

840
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,690
If your matrix is not
positive definite,

841
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:22,240
MATLAB will tell you so.

842
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,700
So it produces one
particular A. There

843
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,970
are many A's that
would work, but there's

844
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:30,310
one particular upper
triangular one.

845
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:40,010
It's just related to the
usual U, but yes, thanks.

846
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:43,070
No, I only even get
into that ballpark

847
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,110
if the matrix is symmetric.

848
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,510
I don't touch it otherwise.

849
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:51,510
So my matrix is
symmetric before I begin.

850
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,670
So I know good things about it.

851
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:57,440
And here I'm asking for more.

852
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,460
Here I'm asking are the
pivots all positive?

853
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,810
Are the eigenvalues
all positive?

854
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:06,060
So that's more.

855
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:10,460
But I could think of
some interpretation that

856
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,890
would, for
non-symmetric matrices,

857
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:17,590
but it has problems, so
I'd rather just leave it.

858
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:22,470
Stay with symmetric.

859
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:27,210
Well that's two hours of
lots of linear algebra.

860
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:31,220
I'm hoping you're going to
like the MATLAB problem.

861
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:41,640
Would you like to
see what it'll be?

862
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,850
I'll just tell you what
the equation will be.

863
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:49,920
So it'll be a
differential equation.

864
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,830
Oh, dear, what is it?

865
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:57,030
So it's a differential
equation with a -u''

866
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:00,260
that we know and love.

867
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:03,110
And what else has it got?

868
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,600
Oh yes, right.

869
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,300
So here's the problem.

870
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,890
Here's the equation.

871
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:21,050
So it has the -u'', the second
derivative and it has a first

872
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:24,600
derivative equal whatever.

873
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,570
In fact, the example will
choose a delta function there.

874
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:32,390
So what am I talking about here?

875
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:37,200
This would be a diffusion
and this would be,

876
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,910
anybody met these things before?

877
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,380
That would be a convection.

878
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:46,890
So that's a first derivative,
that's an anti-symmetric.

879
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:50,800
The MATLAB problem is now going
to create the difference matrix

880
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,370
for that.

881
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:55,070
So the symmetric part
will be our old friend K.

882
00:54:55,070 --> 00:55:02,340
But now we've got the
convection term is appearing.

883
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,900
And it's going to
be anti-symmetric.

884
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,450
And if v is big, it gets
more and more important.

885
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:10,520
So what happens?

886
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,360
What happens with
equations like this?

887
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,980
Really this is like the
first time in the course

888
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:22,390
that we've allowed this first
derivative term to pop up.

889
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:29,970
But nevertheless we can see
a lot of what's happening.

890
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,570
And how to deal with
those equations?

891
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:37,130
I mean, if you ask a chemical
engineer or anybody, they're

892
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:41,920
always dealing with a flow, like
the Charles River is flowing

893
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,820
along, that's coming
from the velocity there,

894
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:48,670
but at the same time
stuff is diffusing in it.

895
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:53,070
It's just a constant problem
in true, true applications.

896
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:56,450
And this is the
best model, I think.

897
00:55:56,450 --> 00:56:03,780
So you'll see that and
I'm pleased about that.

898
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,120
As you'd see.

899
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,460
Any last question?

900
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,580
I'm always happy.

901
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,830
Well I'll see you Friday then.

902
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,610
Thanks for coming.
