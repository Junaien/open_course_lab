9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,200
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, so I've
got Quiz 2 to give back to

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,040
with good scores.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,050
So it's Christmas early.

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,800
Or, good work on that exam.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,510
That's fine and so we all
know Fourier series is

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:42,450
like a central topic on the
final third of the course,

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,470
and I'll just keep
going on Fourier series.

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:51,360
I'll give you homework
on 4.1 and 4.2.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,180
So 4.1 is what we complete
today, the Fourier series.

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,910
4.2 is the discrete
Fourier series.

19
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,990
So those are two
major, major topics

20
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,190
for this part of the course.

21
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,960
This is the periodic one and
4.2 will be the finite one,

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,910
with the Fourier
matrix showing up.

23
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,830
OK, so can I pick
out, I've made a list

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:25,570
of topics last time that
were important for 4.1,

25
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,780
for Fourier series.

26
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:33,830
And I think these are the
remaining entries on the list.

27
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:42,970
I did the Fourier series for the
odd square wave, the minus one

28
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,090
stepping up to plus one.

29
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,760
And you remember that, well just
let me put that example down

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,560
here.

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,450
That was the step
function; easier

32
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,270
if I draw it than if I
try to write equations,

33
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,480
so it was minus
one up to plus one,

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,180
ending at-- of
course period 2pi.

35
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:11,890
And I guess we called that S(x),
for S signaling step function,

36
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,400
S signaling square wave.

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,010
And S the general a signal
that the function is odd.

38
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,100
And that means that it
goes with sine functions.

39
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:31,450
And I think the numbers that
we found from the formula was

40
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:40,620
sin(x)/1, sin(3x)/3, sin(5x)/5,
it's just a great one

41
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,680
to remember.

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:53,120
And that's the example
that has the important,

43
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,840
and I don't know if I
wrote down Gibbs' name.

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,945
He was the great
physicist at Yale, well,

45
00:03:02,945 --> 00:03:10,520
a hundred years ago or
more, and did this key idea

46
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,260
that appears all the time,
that any time you have a step

47
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:20,380
function then the Fourier
series, it does its best,

48
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,910
I if I take a thousand
term, it'll do its best

49
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,960
but it will overshoot by
an amount that Gibbs found,

50
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,070
and then it will
get really close

51
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:36,480
and then it will overshoot
again and then, symmetrically.

52
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,010
Or anti-symmetrically,
I should say.

53
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,030
So that's the Gibbs phenomenon
of great importance.

54
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,120
I write this one out
because first it's

55
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,140
an important one to remember.

56
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,410
Second it'll give
us a good example

57
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:58,620
for this important equality,
that the energy in the function

58
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,970
is the energy in
the coefficient.

59
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,250
That'll be good.

60
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,270
OK, actually maybe I
should do that one first

61
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,900
because the delta function
has got infinite energy

62
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,560
and we don't learn anything
from this equation.

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,570
So let me jump to the
energy in the function

64
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,900
and the energy in
the coefficient.

65
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,910
So what do I mean by energy?

66
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,300
Well, it's quadratic.

67
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,640
Right?

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,980
It's the length squared here.

69
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,120
It's the length squared
of the function.

70
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,500
So let me compute, maybe I'll
do it on this board underneath

71
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,140
and leave space for
the delta function.

72
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,540
The energy in x space
is just the integral--

73
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,630
It's the length squared.

74
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:52,090
The integral of
S(x) squared. dx.

75
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:59,900
It's just what you would expect.

76
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,990
We have a function,
not a vector,

77
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,180
so we can't sum
coefficients squared.

78
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,740
Instead we integrate
all the values squared.

79
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,550
And of course, this is a
number that we can quickly

80
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,280
compute for that function.

81
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,800
So what does it turn out to be?

82
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,200
Well, what is S(x)
squared for that function?

83
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,580
One, obviously.

84
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,480
The function is one here.

85
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,970
I'm looking at the original
S(x), not the series.

86
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,410
The function is one there
and minus one there.

87
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,100
When I squared
those, S(x) squared

88
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,570
is one everywhere so I'm
integrating one everywhere

89
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,450
from minus pi to pi.

90
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,840
So I get the answer 2pi.

91
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,900
So that's a case
where the energy

92
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,100
in the physical
space, the x space,

93
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,260
was totally easy to compute.

94
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,660
Now, what about energy,
what is this equality?

95
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:03,630
This really neat easy
to remember equality?

96
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,480
I'm just going to find it by
taking this thing squared.

97
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,050
What's the integral of
the right-hand side?

98
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:20,590
The two are equal, so
suppose I just fire away?

99
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,980
I integrate the square
of that infinite series.

100
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,050
You're going to say, well
that's going to take a while.

101
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,750
But what's going to be good?

102
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,630
The key point, the first
point in last time's lecture,

103
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,180
the first point in every
discussion of Fourier series,

104
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,220
is orthogonality.

105
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,530
Sines times other sines
integrated are zero.

106
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,790
So a whole lot of terms will go.

107
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,090
So I take that
thing, I square it.

108
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,680
So let me let me
do that one here.

109
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,880
The interval from
minus pi to pi.

110
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,140
May I take out the
(4/pi) squared?

111
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:07,510
Just so it's not confusing.

112
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:16,210
Now, this is the sin(x)/1,
sin(3x)/3, sin(kx)/k,

113
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,770
and so on.

114
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,760
All squared. dx, and
so what do I get?

115
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,580
The (4/pi) squared.

116
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,210
And now I've got a
whole lot of terms.

117
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,600
But the thing is, I can do this.

118
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,660
Because when I square this,
I'll have a lot of terms like

119
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,870
sin(x)*sin(3x), and when I
integrate those I get zero.

120
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,290
So the only ones
that I don't get zero

121
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,540
are when sin(x)
integrates against itself.

122
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,070
And sin(3x) against itself.

123
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,780
So when sin(x) integrates
against itself,

124
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,410
that's sine squared.

125
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,655
Its integral is, you
remember the integral

126
00:07:56,655 --> 00:08:03,260
of sine squared, which is,
its average value is 1/2.

127
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,750
We're over an interval-- I
think I'm going to get pi,

128
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,580
for sine squared.

129
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,770
Because sine squared-- We could
do that calculation separately.

130
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,130
It's just a standard integral.

131
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,600
The integral of
sine squared is pi.

132
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,580
Actually, yeah it
just uses the fact

133
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:25,460
that sine squared x is the same
as whatever it is the same as.

134
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:33,360
Is it 1-cos(2x) or something?

135
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,220
Over two.

136
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,230
Or plus, who cares?

137
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:42,400
Because the integral of
whichever, plus or minus,

138
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,412
let me, well I suppose
for history's sake

139
00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:47,370
we should get it right.

140
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,190
Which is it?

141
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,800
Is it a minus, so
it looks OK now?

142
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,690
OK, alright, if it's
wrong I didn't say.

143
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,490
OK, but I'm going to integrate.

144
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,520
So the integral of
the cosine is zero,

145
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,240
and the integral of the 1/2
is the part I'm talking about.

146
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,520
That 1/2 is there all the
way from minus pi to pi.

147
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
So I get a pi.

148
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,300
From all these sines.

149
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,410
And now, what are all the terms?

150
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:21,170
Well, one over one squared,
that just had a coefficient one,

151
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,960
but what's the next guy?

152
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,720
You remember I'm squaring
it, I'm integrating.

153
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,750
But I have a 1/3 squared.

154
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,610
And 1/5 squared.

155
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,940
And so on.

156
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,110
And here's a great point.

157
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,850
These two are equal.

158
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,270
I've got the same function,
expressed in x space,

159
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,050
and here it's expressed in
sine space, you could say.

160
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,710
In harmonic space.

161
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,210
OK, so that's equal.

162
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,070
And that's going to be
the fact in general.

163
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,070
In general, that
the integral of S(x)

164
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,220
squared, so the general fact
will be the integral of-- Well,

165
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,590
I'll write it down below.

166
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,540
But let's just see what
we got for numbers here.

167
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,530
So I had pi on both sides.

168
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,990
And so if I lift that over
there, I get something

169
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,460
like-- what do I have?

170
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:22,060
Pi squared over 16, maybe I
have pi squared over eight.

171
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,430
You just get a
remarkable formula.

172
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,820
Putting that up there would
be pi squared over 16,

173
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,550
and the two makes it an eight.

174
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:36,640
And here I have the sum of
1/1 squared plus 1/3 squared

175
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,700
plus 1/5 squared.

176
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,830
So, that's an infinite
sum that I would not

177
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:50,460
have known how to do
except it appears here.

178
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,770
The sum of one over
all those squares.

179
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,600
If I picked another
example, I could

180
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,010
get the sum-- Oh, this was
all the odd numbers squared.

181
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,160
If I picked a
different function,

182
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,140
I could have got one that
also had the sin(2x)/2

183
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,800
and the sin(4x)/4.

184
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,490
So this would have been
the sum of all the squares.

185
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,580
Do you happen to know
what that comes out to be?

186
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,070
I mean, here's a
way to compute pi.

187
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,320
We have a formula for pi.

188
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,390
And we'd have another formula
that involved all the sums.

189
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,150
Maybe I have room
for it up here.

190
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:37,280
This would be the sum
of 1/n squared, right?

191
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,900
This here I have
only the odd ones.

192
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,620
And I get pi squared over eight.

193
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,300
Do you happen to know what
I get for all of them?

194
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,810
So I'm also including
1/2 squared,

195
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,160
there's a quarter also in here.

196
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,960
And also a 16th.

197
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,270
And also a 36th, in this one.

198
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:01,080
And the answer happens to
be pi squared over six.

199
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:08,100
Pi squared over six.

200
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,660
The important point about
this energy equality

201
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:19,010
is not being able to get a
few very remarkable formulas

202
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,800
for pi.

203
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,050
There's another remarkable
formula in the homework.

204
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,480
This is a little famous.

205
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,360
Do you know what this is?

206
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,890
This is the famous
Riemann zeta function.

207
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:39,230
The sum of 1/n^x is
the zeta function at x.

208
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,840
Here's the zeta function at two.

209
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,100
So if I could draws a zeta.

210
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,700
Maybe?

211
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,980
There's a Greek guy in
this class who could

212
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,470
do it properly, but anyway.

213
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,650
I'll chicken out.

214
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:02,530
Zeta of, at the
value two, zeta(2).

215
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,630
So we know zeta(2),
we know zeta(4).

216
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,495
I don't think we
know zeta(3), I think

217
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:18,000
it's not a special number
like pi squared over six.

218
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,440
So the zeta function, the
sum of 1 over n to this thing

219
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,350
is, actually that's the
subject of a problem

220
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,170
that Riemann did not solve.

221
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,836
There's a problem
Riemann did not solve,

222
00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:36,480
and nobody has succeeded to
find it, to solve it since.

223
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,830
There's a million-dollar
prize for its solution.

224
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,150
My neighbors think I
should be working on this,

225
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,760
but I know better.

226
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,570
It's going to be solved one
day, but it's pretty difficult.

227
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:56,250
And that is to know where this
zeta function, where it's zero.

228
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,880
Of course, it isn't zero at two.

229
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,260
Because it's pi
squared over six.

230
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,210
And actually the conjecture
is that it's zero,

231
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:10,140
all the zeroes are at
points, complex numbers

232
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,330
with real part 1/2.

233
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,280
So they're on this famous
line, the imaginary line

234
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,480
with real part 1/2.

235
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,250
And that's the most important
problem in pure mathematics.

236
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,130
So here we go.

237
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,310
We got a formula for pi out
of this energy identity.

238
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:36,250
And I'll write it again,
once I have the complex form.

239
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,300
OK, but you see
where it comes from.

240
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,460
It just comes from
orthogonality.

241
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,710
The fact that we could
integrate that square

242
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,920
is what made it all work.

243
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,650
OK, let's do the delta function.

244
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,710
So that's an even
function, the delta, right?

245
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,760
Now I'm looking at
the delta function.

246
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,030
Minus pi to pi.

247
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:05,360
It has the spike at
zero and it's certainly

248
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,990
even so we expect cosines.

249
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,990
And what are the coefficients?

250
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:15,580
So it's just an
important one to know.

251
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,760
Very important example.

252
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,950
So what's a_0?

253
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,900
In general, the coefficient
a_0 in the Fourier series

254
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:28,680
is the-- If I have a
function, delta(x), S(x),

255
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,460
whatever my function, the a_0
coefficient is the average.

256
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,210
a for average, a_0
is the average value.

257
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:46,000
So this is 1/(2pi) the
integral from minus pi to pi

258
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,920
of my function.

259
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,400
Where did that come from?

260
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,020
I just integrated.

261
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,850
I just multiplied
both sides by one.

262
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,480
Or by 1/(2pi), and integrated.

263
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,970
And those terms disappeared,
and I was left with a_0,

264
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,900
and what's the answer?

265
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,730
Everybody knows that integral.

266
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,560
The integral of the
delta function is one,

267
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,620
so I just get 1/(2pi).

268
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,410
So 1/(2pi).

269
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,600
OK, now ready for a_1.

270
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,550
How much of cos(x) do I have?

271
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,150
Can I just change this
formula to give me a_1

272
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,230
and you can tell
me what it gives?

273
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,150
Well let me do it here.

274
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,540
Here's a_1.

275
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,550
What's the formula for a_1?

276
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,720
It's just like b_1,
like the sine formulas.

277
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,220
You have to remember
you're only dividing by pi.

278
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,010
Because that average
value was 1/2, as we saw.

279
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,780
And then you have the integral
of whatever your function is.

280
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,940
delta(x) in this case.

281
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,440
Times the cos(1x).

282
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,360
If we're looking for a_1 we've
multiplied both sides by cos(x)

283
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,460
and integrated.

284
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,960
And what answer do we get?

285
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,430
For a_1?

286
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:11,520
What's the integral of
delta(x) times cos(x)?

287
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,110
dx, so I should put in a dx.

288
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,340
And the answer is?

289
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,860
One, also one.

290
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,150
The delta function, this
spike, picks out the value

291
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,212
of this function at the spike.

292
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:25,670
Because of course
it doesn't matter

293
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,620
what that function is
away from the spike,

294
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,357
because the other
factor, delta, is zero.

295
00:17:31,357 --> 00:17:33,190
Everything is at that
spike, all the action,

296
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,690
and this happens to
be one at the spike.

297
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,080
So I get a 1/pi.

298
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,010
And actually, the same
formula for all these guys.

299
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:48,280
This will be the same with
cos(x) changed to cos(2x).

300
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,550
And what will be the answer now?

301
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,360
Again, one.

302
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,030
Right?

303
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,740
It's the value of this integral.

304
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,900
The formula for
a_2 would have come

305
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:05,520
by multiplying both sides
by cos(2x), integrating.

306
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,530
And the integral of cos
squared would give me the pi,

307
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,960
and I'm dividing by
the pi, and I just

308
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,970
need that integral
and it's easy.

309
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,090
It's also 1/pi.

310
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,880
So all these are 1/pi.

311
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,150
Let me just put in the formula.

312
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:31,880
1/(2pi), and all the
rest are 1/pi. cos(3x).

313
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,970
All the cosines are there.

314
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,940
All in the same amount.

315
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:43,060
And the constant term
is slightly different.

316
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:49,330
OK, that's the formal Fourier
series for the delta function.

317
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:55,130
Formal meaning you
can use it to compute,

318
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,320
of course some things will
fail, like what's the energy?

319
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,120
If I integrate, if
I try to do energy

320
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,370
in x space of the delta
function, or energy in k space,

321
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,180
what answer would I get?

322
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,720
Right, the integral of
delta squared, its energy,

323
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,320
is infinite, right?

324
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,430
The integral of delta, if
I have delta times delta

325
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,800
then I'm really
in trouble, right?

326
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,860
Because this delta says,
if I can speak informally,

327
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,060
that delta says take the
value of this function

328
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,230
at zero, but of course
that's infinite,

329
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,450
so that would be infinite.

330
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:39,940
That would be the
energy in x space.

331
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,620
What about the
energy in k space?

332
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,530
Well, let's think, what's
the energy in k space?

333
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,590
I'm going to do the squares
of the coefficients,

334
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,600
you remember that's
what I had down here?

335
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,450
And I'll have it
again in a moment.

336
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,620
It's the sum of the squares
of the coefficients, fixed up

337
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,800
by factors of pi.

338
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,730
And here, all the
coefficients are constants.

339
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,590
So that sum is infinite.

340
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,890
Again, it's the sum of
squares, of constant,

341
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,040
constant, constant,
constants, and that series

342
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,910
doesn't converge, it blows up.

343
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,300
So the energy is infinite.

344
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,910
That's OK.

345
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,010
The key is that formula.

346
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,620
OK, there's the
formula to remember.

347
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,510
There's the formula.

348
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,800
On forever.

349
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:40,370
Every frequency is in
here to the same amount.

350
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,520
OK, good.

351
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,920
That's the delta
function example.

352
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:51,100
OK, ready to go to complex?

353
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,990
Complex is no big deal
because we know, actually,

354
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,375
you can tell me the complex
series for the delta function.

355
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,720
I'll write it right underneath.

356
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,000
The complex series for
the delta function,

357
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,890
just turn these guys
into e^(i*theta)--

358
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:18,510
e^(i*x)'s, and e^(i*2x)'s,
and e^(-i*2x)'s.

359
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,460
Just term by term,
just to see it.

360
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,820
To see it clearly for
this great example.

361
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,780
So what does cos(2x)
look like in terms

362
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,600
of complex exponentials?

363
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:45,800
Everybody knows cos(x) is the
same as e^(ix) and e^(-ix),

364
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,080
right?

365
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,480
Divided by two, because
this is cos(x)+i*sin(x),

366
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,820
this is cos(x)-i*sin(x), when
I add them I get two cos(x)'s.

367
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,610
So I must divide by two.

368
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,440
Let me divide by
two all the way.

369
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,670
So I'm dividing
this 1/pi by two.

370
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,750
You'll see it's so much nicer.

371
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,470
So 1/(2pi) times the one,
that's our first guy.

372
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,020
And now I've got the next guy.

373
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,520
Right?

374
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,650
Because I need to divide by
the two to get the cosine,

375
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,870
and there's my two.

376
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,340
OK, what's the next?

377
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,710
What do I have next?

378
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,740
From this guy.

379
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,790
1/pi, still there.

380
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,900
What's cos(2x), if I
want to write it in terms

381
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,560
of complex exponentials?

382
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:51,330
So this guy now, I'm ready for
him, is e^(i*2x) and e^(-i*2x).

383
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,180


384
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,990
Divided by two,
and there's my two.

385
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,690
Do you see what's happening?

386
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,350
There's an example
to show you why

387
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,960
the complex case is so nice.

388
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:12,140
Here we had to remember a
different number for a_0.

389
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:17,090
Here it's just, so the
next one will be e^(i*3x),

390
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:26,460
and e^(-i*3x), so that the delta
function in the complex Fourier

391
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,270
series, all the terms have
coefficients one divided

392
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,510
by the 2pi.

393
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,180
That's a great example.

394
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:40,850
And of course we see again that
the sum of squares, oh yeah.

395
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:47,740
So let's do the complex
formula, by which I

396
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:53,850
mean I'm taking any function
F, not necessarily even, not

397
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,390
necessarily odd, not
necessarily real.

398
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,550
Any function can now
be a complex function,

399
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,870
because we're going to
use complex things here.

400
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:12,950
So I'll have all the
complex exponentials.

401
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,220
For integer k.

402
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,670
This k is an integer but it
can go from minus infinity

403
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,960
to infinity.

404
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,820
That's the complex form.

405
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:32,790
F(x) is a series again.

406
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:37,030
The beauty is that every
term looks the same.

407
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:41,390
The thing you have to remember
is that negative k is allowed,

408
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,860
as well as positive k.

409
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,010
You see that we
needed the negative k

410
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:52,950
to get cosines. k was minus
1 there, k was minus 2 there.

411
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,540
And for sines we
would also need them.

412
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,850
So cosines go into
it, sines go into it.

413
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,870
F(x) could be complex.

414
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,800
That's the complex series.

415
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,520
So maybe we could have
started with that series.

416
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,030
But we didn't, we
came to it here.

417
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,400
But what's the formula
for its coefficient?

418
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,460
OK, actually, so the
next half-hour now,

419
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,830
we have to think complex.

420
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,380
And that will bring
a few changes.

421
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,760
So watch for the changes.

422
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:32,990
You see we're almost
in the same ballpark,

423
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,410
but there are a couple
of things to notice.

424
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,530
So let me write down
that series again.

425
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:43,310
Minus infinity to infinity
of some coefficient e^(ikx).

426
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,740
Now, what is c_k?

427
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:54,800
What is the formula for c_k?

428
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,830
As soon as we answer
that question,

429
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:02,690
you'll see the new
aspect for complex.

430
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,290
How do I find coefficients?

431
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:09,320
I multiply by
something, I integrate,

432
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,970
and I use orthogonality.

433
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,850
Same idea, just
repeat after repeat.

434
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,200
The question is, what
do I multiply by?

435
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,360
If I wanted to
know c_3, suppose I

436
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,430
want to know a formula
for c_3, the coefficient.

437
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,470
What am I going to
multiply by that's

438
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,860
going to give me the
orthogonality I need,

439
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,540
that all the other integrals
are going to disappear,

440
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,890
that's the key?

441
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,740
I want to multiply by something
so that when I integrate,

442
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,020
all the other integrals
are going to disappear.

443
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,780
And let's just do it.

444
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:48,750
Here, suppose I have e^(i5x).

445
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:56,260
And I'm looking for c_3.

446
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,820
So I'll look at e^(i3x).

447
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:04,530


448
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,460
So watch.

449
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,840
This is the small
point we have to make.

450
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,760
So I'm looking for e^(i3x).

451
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,460
So I'm going to
multiply by something,

452
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,900
and I'm going to integrate.

453
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:21,070
And what would be the
good thing to multiply by?

454
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,840
Well, you would say, if you
were just a real person,

455
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,070
you would say multiply
by e^(i3x), integrate.

456
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,540
And hope for getting zero.

457
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,230
You won't get zero.

458
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:38,000
If I multiply e^(i3x)--
I'm sorry, you might say--

459
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,690
What am I doing here?

460
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,670
I'm trying to check
orthogonality.

461
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,110
Let me instead of three use kx.

462
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,650


463
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,160
So that's a typical complex one.

464
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,340
It's any one of these guys.

465
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:00,850
And I want to see
what's orthogonality.

466
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,650
That's what I'm asking.

467
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,840
Everything hinged
on orthogonality.

468
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,440
We've got to have
orthogonality here.

469
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,160
But let me show you what it is.

470
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:18,670
The thing you multiply by to get
the c_3 is not e^(i3x), it is?

471
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,020
e^(-i3x).

472
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,120
You take the conjugate.

473
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,720
You change i to minus
i in the complex case.

474
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,880
So if I take e^(ikx)
times e^(-ilx),

475
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,350
and notice that minus,
I claim that I get zero.

476
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,700
Except if k is l.

477
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,720
And when k is l, I
probably get 2pi.

478
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,540
If k is l.

479
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,020
I get zero if k is not l.

480
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,120
That's the beautiful
orthogonality.

481
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,750
I'm not too worried about the
2pi, I'll figure that out.

482
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:08,110
So what I'm saying is, when
you're taking inner products,

483
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,260
dot products, and you've
got complex stuff,

484
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:17,090
one of the factors takes
a complex conjugate.

485
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,350
Change i to minus i.

486
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,240
Do you see that we've got a
completely easy integral now?

487
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,750
What is the integral
of this guy?

488
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,430
How do I see that
I really get zero?

489
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:31,010
So this is the first time I'm
actually doing an integration

490
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,720
and seeing orthogonality.

491
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,030
Anybody likes
integrating these things,

492
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:43,470
because they're so
simple to integrate.

493
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,330
Before I plug in
the limits, what's

494
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,460
the integral of this guy?

495
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:53,160
How do I rewrite that
to integrate it easily?

496
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,150
I put the two
exponents together.

497
00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:03,700
This is the same as
e^(i(k-l)x), right?

498
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,020
The exponentials
follow that rule.

499
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,580
If I multiply exponentials,
I combine the exponents.

500
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,730
And now I'm ready to integrate.

501
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:15,610
And so what is the
integral of e^(i(k-l))x?

502
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,510


503
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,235
When I integrate e
to the something x,

504
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:29,580
I get that same thing again
divided by the something.

505
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,710
So now I've integrated, and
now I just want to go from zero

506
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:40,610
to 2pi, plug in the
limits from x=0 to x=2pi.

507
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,200
This is what the integral
is asking me for.

508
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,400
So I'm actually doing
the integral here.

509
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,600
I put these together
into that, I integrated,

510
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,880
which just brought
this term down below,

511
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:01,900
because the derivative
will bring that term above.

512
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,340
Oh, they weren't
meant to change.

513
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,830
Actually, it's wrong but right.

514
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,360
To change those
integration limits.

515
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,360
I mean, any 2pi would
work, but thank you.

516
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,010
You're totally right, I should
have done minus pi to pi.

517
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:18,970
Why do we get zero?

518
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,240
That's the whole point.

519
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,710
Here we actually
did the integral,

520
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:28,730
and we can just plug
in x=pi and x=-pi.

521
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,430
Or we could plug
in zero and 2pi,

522
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:35,630
or I could plug in any
guys that were 2pi apart,

523
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,380
any period of 2pi.

524
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:43,590
Why do we get zero?

525
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:48,040
Do you have to do the
plugging in part to see it?

526
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,860
You can, certainly.

527
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,550
But the point is, this
function is periodic.

528
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,920
That's a function
that has period 2pi.

529
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,000
So it has to be the same at
the lower and the upper limit.

530
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,620
That's what it's coming to.

531
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,120
That's a periodic function.

532
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,430
It's equal at these two limits.

533
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,990
And therefore, when
I do the subtraction

534
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,830
I take it at the top
limit, minus the answer

535
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,880
at the bottom limit,
it's the same at both.

536
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,240
So I get zero.

537
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,740
So there is the actual
check of orthogonality.

538
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,110
So the key point
was, orthogonality,

539
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,480
or inner product, for complex
functions, one of them

540
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,610
has to take the
complex conjugate.

541
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,080
Let me just do for vectors, too.

542
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,560
Complex vectors.

543
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,680
I may have mentioned it, let
me take the vector [1, i]

544
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,240
as an extreme example.

545
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,060
And suppose I wanted to find
the inner product with itself.

546
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,170
Which will be the
length squared.

547
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:59,740
What's the inner product of
that vector, that complex vector

548
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,750
[1, i], with itself?

549
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,410
Let me just raise
it up so we see it.

550
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,540
Focus on this.

551
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:12,930
Usually the length squared would
be one squared plus i squared.

552
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:13,560
No good.

553
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,260
Why no good?

554
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,660
Because it's zero.

555
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,370
One squared plus
i squared is zero.

556
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:26,690
We want absolute values squared.

557
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,560
Absolute values,
we need squares.

558
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,370
We need positive numbers here.

559
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:35,060
So the length of this
squared, I would-- So

560
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:41,090
let me call that vector v. I
want to take not v transpose

561
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:50,130
v, that's the thing that would
give me zero, if I did [1, i].

562
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:53,480
I have to take the
complex conjugate.

563
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,140
One of the two factors, and
it's just a matter of convention

564
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,490
which one you do, this is
the thing that gives me

565
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,610
the length of v squared.

566
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,630
And it's the same
thing for functions.

567
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:10,430
It's the integral of F(x)--
Do you want me to write it

568
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:16,930
as, it's the integral of
F(x) times its conjugate.

569
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:21,620
That gives me the
length of F squared.

570
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:27,300
And of course I can rewrite
that as the integral of F.

571
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:33,160
We have this handy notation
for F times its conjugate.

572
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:40,050
It's like re^(i*theta)
times re^(-i*theta),

573
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:51,420
the product of re^(i*theta)
times re^(-i*theta) is what?

574
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:55,150
This is the complex number,
this is its conjugate,

575
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,820
when I multiply, you notice
that i went to minus i

576
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:06,960
when I drop below the real axis,
I just change i to minus i.

577
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,100
So those cancel and
I get r squared.

578
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,910
The length, the
size of the number.

579
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,810
It's just, if you
haven't thought complex

580
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:22,090
just make this change
and you're ready to go.

581
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:29,430
Yeah just v bar transpose v, F
bar transpose F, if you like,

582
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:33,390
or F squared.

583
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,320
And when we make
the correct change

584
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,810
we still have the orthogonality.

585
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,820
OK?

586
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,870
So that's what orthogonality
is, now what's the coefficient?

587
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,990
So now, after all that
speech, tell me what

588
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,930
do I multiply both sides by?

589
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,830
Let me start again
and remember here.

590
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:03,440
So my F(x) is going to
be sum of c_k*e^(ikx).

591
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,940
And if I want to
get a coefficient,

592
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,480
I'm looking for a
formula for c_3.

593
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,870
So how do I find c_3?

594
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,070
Let me slow down a second.

595
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,210
How to find c_3?

596
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:22,210


597
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:27,430
Multiply both sides by what?

598
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:31,680
And integrate.

599
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,620
Minus pi to pi.

600
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,200
What goes there?

601
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,530
If I want c_3, I should
multiply both sides by, should I

602
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,110
multiply both sides by e^(i3x)?

603
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,630
Nope.

604
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,360
e^(-i3x).

605
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,310
Multiply both sides by
e^(-i3x) and integrate.

606
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:57,700
e^(-i3x) d x.

607
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,880
And then on the right
side I get what?

608
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,460
I get c_3, because that'll
be e^(-i3x) times e^(+i3x),

609
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:14,310
I'll be integrating one so
I get a 2pi, and all zeroes.

610
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,140
From all the other terms.

611
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,960
Orthogonality doing
its job again.

612
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,290
All these zeroes are
by orthogonality.

613
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:28,580
By exactly this
integration that we did.

614
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:35,960
If k is three and l is seven
or k is seven and l is three,

615
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,340
the integral gives zero.

616
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,480
So what's the formula then?

617
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:47,190
This is all gone, divide
by 2pi and you've got it.

618
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,360
There you are.

619
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,200
That's the coefficient.

620
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,760
OK.

621
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,780
We have to move to
complex numbers,

622
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:01,760
and now in those 20 minutes--
The only change to make

623
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,730
is conjugate one of them.

624
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:11,180
One of the things when
it can be complex.

625
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:16,470
So that's the complex series.

626
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,330
What's the energy
inequality now?

627
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:25,010
Let me do the energy equality
in x space and in k space.

628
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:30,940
If I take this, now
I'd like-- So that's

629
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,090
an equality of two functions.

630
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:38,200
Now I'd like to get it,
I want to do energy.

631
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,530
This is fantastic.

632
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,160
And extremely
practical and useful.

633
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,490
The fact that the energy is
going to come out beautifully,

634
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:45,990
too.

635
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,280
So what am I going
to do for energy?

636
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,190
I'm going to integrate
F(x) squared, dx.

637
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,070
That's the energy.

638
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,730
That's the energy in x
space, in the function.

639
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,190
What do I do now?

640
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:11,310
I integrate this series.
c_k*e^(ikx) squared.

641
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,470
Oh no, whoa.

642
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:18,220
If I put a square
there, right, I'm fired.

643
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,775
Right?

644
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:19,650
What do I have to do?

645
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,840
I will put a square
there, but I have

646
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,190
to straighten out something.

647
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,000
What do I do?

648
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,260
Those curvy lines,
which just meant

649
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:35,460
take the thing and square,
should be changed to?

650
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,480
Straight.

651
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,420
Just a matter of
getting straight.

652
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,860
Straightening this out.

653
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,700
OK, straight.

654
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,750
There we are.

655
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,120
OK.

656
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,570
Now, that means the thing
times its conjugate.

657
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,380
That's the thing
times its conjugate.

658
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,520
So what do I get?

659
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,540
All the terms disappear
except the perfect,

660
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,450
the ones that are squared.

661
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,870
So what do I get here?

662
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,900
And the ones that are
squared I'm integrating one,

663
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,050
so I get a 2pi.

664
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,290
So there's a 2pi.

665
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,910
This whole subject's full of
these pi's and 2pi's, it's

666
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,510
just part of the deal.

667
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,230
Now, what's left?

668
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,510
And now I'm looking
only at the terms where

669
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:22,560
I'm integrating something
by its conjugate,

670
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,320
by its own conjugate.

671
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,040
And then I'm getting c_k
times its own conjugate,

672
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,380
so I'm getting all the terms.

673
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,880
I'm getting no cross
terms, just the terms

674
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,620
that come from that
times it's own conjugate.

675
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:40,340
Which is c_k squared.

676
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:46,470
That's the energy
in the coefficients.

677
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:50,400
That's the energy in k
space, and of course that sum

678
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,670
goes minus infinity to infinity.

679
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,330
I've got them all.

680
00:40:54,330 --> 00:41:00,220
That's the energy in k space,
here's the energy in x space.

681
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:06,410
You can expect that
this orthogonality

682
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:11,760
is going to give you
something nice for the energy.

683
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,850
For the integral of the square.

684
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,780
Alright, so you saw that.

685
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,150
And let's see.

686
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,000
So we saw it for, we
actually got a good number

687
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,880
for the square wave.

688
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,280
We got infinity for
the delta function.

689
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,170
I've put on here
as a last topic,

690
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,730
to just give the word function.

691
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:42,000
Part of what this course is
doing is to speak the language,

692
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,410
teach the language
of applied math.

693
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,960
So that when you see
something, you see this,

694
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,910
you recognize hey I've
seen that word before.

695
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,980
So I want to know, what's
the right space of functions?

696
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:07,530
This is my measure for the
length squared of a function.

697
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:11,580
My square wave is great.

698
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,180
It's length squared
was whatever it was,

699
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,760
pi squared over something.

700
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,060
And that's its length squared.

701
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:26,580
The delta function
gave infinity.

702
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,470
So it's not going to be allowed
into the function space.

703
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,370
It's a vector of
infinite length.

704
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:36,640
Like the vector 1,
1, 1, 1, 1 forever.

705
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,550
Too long.

706
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:42,830
Pythagoras fails, because we sum
the squares, we get infinite.

707
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:49,350
So what functions, what vectors
should we allow in our space?

708
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,800
So we're going to
have a space that's

709
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,980
going to be infinite-dimensional
because our coefficients,

710
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,800
we've got infinitely
many coefficients.

711
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,070
Our functions have
infinitely many values.

712
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,930
So we've moved up from
n-dimensional space

713
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,910
to infinite-dimensional space.

714
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:13,880
And everybody calls it after
the guy who, Hilbert space.

715
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,420
So I don't know if you've seen
that word before, that name

716
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,350
before, Hilbert space.

717
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:24,110
It's the space of functions
with finite energy.

718
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,110
Finite length.

719
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:31,780
So this function is in it, the
delta function is not in it.

720
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:37,270
And the point is that this
space of functions, we've

721
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:40,830
got-- These guys
are a great basis

722
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,540
for the space of functions.

723
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,900
The sines and cosines
are another basis

724
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,410
for this space of functions.

725
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,650
We just have a whole
lot of functions,

726
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:55,420
and all the facts of
n-dimensional space.

727
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,630
So what are important facts
about n-dimensional space?

728
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:07,090
One that comes to mind that
involves length is the-- A

729
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:16,580
key fact about length
is, length and angle,

730
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,510
I could say
actually-- Many people

731
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:22,660
would say this is the
most important inequality

732
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,940
in mathematics.

733
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:36,310
That the dot product
of two vectors,

734
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:39,350
it's called the
Schwarz inequality.

735
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:43,990
Several people found
it independently,

736
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:50,560
Schwarz is the single
name most often used.

737
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,980
What do you know about the
dot product of two vectors?

738
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,740
Somehow it tells you the
angle between them, right?

739
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:03,800
Somehow the dot
product of two vectors

740
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,490
is, if I divide by the
length of the vectors,

741
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:13,140
so the dot product of vectors
divided by the length,

742
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,750
do you know what
this is, in geometry?

743
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,830
It's a cosine.

744
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:21,650
It's the cosine of the
angle between them.

745
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:25,010
And cosines are never
larger than one.

746
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:28,400
So this quantity here is
never larger than one;

747
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,570
in other words,
this is never larger

748
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,620
than the length of one
vector times the length

749
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,890
of the other vector.

750
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,140
I could do an example.

751
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:42,250
Let v be [1, 3].

752
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:46,730
And let w be [1, 6].

753
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:49,070
I don't know how this
is going to work.

754
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:51,020
What's the dot product
of those two vectors?

755
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,090
Oh, it's 19.

756
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:54,420
Sorry about that.

757
00:45:54,420 --> 00:46:02,720
Let's change this, I'd
like a nice number here.

758
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,890
What do you suggest?

759
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,640
Make it five somewhere?

760
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,670
Five wouldn't be bad.

761
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:19,000
It wouldn't be too
good either, but.

762
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,050
Ah, OK.

763
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,250
What's the dot product of those?

764
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,490
16.

765
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,400
And now what am I
claiming, that that's

766
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,560
length less than the length
of this vector, which is what?

767
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,620
What's the length of [1, 3]?

768
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,440
Square root of ten.

769
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,170
It's good to do these small
ones, just to remember.

770
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,910
The length of that
vector is the sum

771
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,830
of the square root of
the sum of the squares.

772
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,160
Square root of ten.

773
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,030
And the length of this guy?

774
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:48,450
Is the square root of 26.

775
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:53,180
And so I hope, and
Schwarz hopes, that 16

776
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,760
is less than that square root.

777
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,300
Can we check it?

778
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,000
Let's square both sides,
that would make it easier.

779
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,220
So the right-hand side when
I square both sides will be?

780
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,900
260.

781
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:14,270
When I square both sides,
and what's the square of 16?

782
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,350
256.

783
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,470
That was close.

784
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:24,510
But, it worked.

785
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,660
I'll admit to you--
Oops not equal.

786
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,930
Ah.

787
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:32,930
Less or equal,
Schwarz would say.

788
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:37,090
And it's actually less than
because these vectors are not

789
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,260
in the same direction.

790
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,350
If they were exactly
in the same direction,

791
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:43,620
or opposite directions,
the cosine would be one

792
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,220
and we would have equal.

793
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:49,420
But since the angle, you see the
angle between those two vectors

794
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,350
is a pretty small angle.

795
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,010
The cosine is quite near one.

796
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:58,160
But it's not exactly one.

797
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,690
So I'm glad somebody
knew 16 squared.

798
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:05,080
Does anybody know 99 squared?

799
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:09,320
The reason I ask
that is, or 999.

800
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,780
I'll make it sound harder.

801
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,200
The hope, when I was
about 11 or something,

802
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,630
I was I was always
hoping somebody

803
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,950
would ask me 999 squared.

804
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:24,030
Because I was all
ready with the answer.

805
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,690
Nobody ever asked.

806
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:26,330
Anyway.

807
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:28,520
But you've asked, I think.

808
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,350
So 998,001.

809
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:36,140
And now I I've finally got a
chance to show that I know it.

810
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,480
OK, have a great
weekend and see you.

811
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,853
