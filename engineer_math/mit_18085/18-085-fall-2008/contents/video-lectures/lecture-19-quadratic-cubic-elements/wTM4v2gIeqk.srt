9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,590
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK.

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,090
All right.

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,630
Good morning.

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:32,120
So we're doing finite elements.

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,380
The element that we
considered so far

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,500
was the basic linear element.

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,590
Continuous, but of course,
the slopes have jumps.

16
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,790
The slope was minus one
over delta x for that one.

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,070
This one was a plus
and then a minus.

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,700
So a jump in slope but
no jump in the function.

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,920
So actually, my
abbreviation for that

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,030
would be C zero, saying
that it's continuous

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,890
but no derivative is continuous.

22
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,280
And now we'll get
to some elements

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,350
where the slope is continuous.

24
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,970
It's sort of fun to create
these finite elements of higher

25
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,520
degree.

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,990
It's pretty
straightforward in 1-D.

27
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,580
And that's where we are now.

28
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,170
So we'll get second degree
elements and third degree

29
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,020
elements.

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,530
And that gives us, as
we'll see, higher accuracy.

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,530
So I want to connect the
degree of the polynomials

32
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:41,820
to the accuracy of
the approximation.

33
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,020
Part of that connection
is to recognize

34
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,950
that these problems have
a strong form, as we know,

35
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,770
the equation; a
weak form, that's

36
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,380
the one that has test functions;
and also a minimum form

37
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,260
that we'll see.

38
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,830
So how would I get some
quadratics, so second degree

39
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:09,650
elements, parabolas,
into the picture?

40
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,910
You remember Galerkin's idea?

41
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,270
Choose trial functions.

42
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,190
And we're taking those to be
the same as the test function.

43
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,160
So these are the trial
functions we've chosen.

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,700
One, two, three, four of them.

45
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,590
And they're linear.

46
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,690
And that limits the
accuracy that you can get,

47
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,190
because your approximations
then are combinations of those.

48
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,250
So they're like
broken-line functions,

49
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,040
linear approximations.

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,650
And the accuracy is not great.

51
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,220
It's sort of the
lowest level possible.

52
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,590
So how would you get parabolas?

53
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,910
So this was first guy.

54
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:08,500
The second guy is going to
be continuous and quadratic.

55
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,880
So it's going to have
new trial functions.

56
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,300
In addition to these, I'm
going to put in some more.

57
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,450
Galerkin's happy with that.

58
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,940
I still proceed as usual.

59
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,170
My approximation is some
combination of those.

60
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,050
It's only going
to be continuous.

61
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,350
So it'll just be a
C zero guy again.

62
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,090
That means jump in slope.

63
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,220
The first derivative
isn't there.

64
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,880
Eventually, I want
to get to a C one

65
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,080
where the slopes are continuous.

66
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,970
OK, but how would I
get some quadratics?

67
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,970
All I want now is my functions,
my space, my combinations,

68
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,650
should be the
piecewise parabolas

69
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,590
instead of piecewise linear.

70
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,450
And the pieces are
broken at the nodes.

71
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,370
OK, so here is a way to do it.

72
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,090
Inside each interval,
I'm going to add,

73
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,250
I'll just call them
bubble functions.

74
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,200
So these will be
new additional guys.

75
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,930
So this will be my first phi.

76
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,720
You remember that half hat?

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,830
Because the problem I was
doing was a free fixed problem.

78
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,070
That's why I had a
half hat at this end,

79
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,330
because there was no boundary
condition that my functions had

80
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,900
to satisfy.

81
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,560
At this end, there was.

82
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,370
It was fixed.

83
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,100
So that's why the hat ended,
and there was no half hat,

84
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,350
there's no extra function there.

85
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,770
So I have right now
one, two, three, four.

86
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,330
I'm going to add four
more bubble functions.

87
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,060
Each one will be
inside an interval.

88
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,210
So it'll be a little parabola.

89
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,250
This is function
number whatever.

90
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,830
If I number this number one,
let's say, phi_1, now --

91
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,640
that's probably a
change in numbering --

92
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,770
phi_2 is going to be my bubble.

93
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,150
And you see what my
bubble function is?

94
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,400
It's a function that
goes there and straight.

95
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,200
So it is continuous, no jumps,
and it is second degree.

96
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,200
It's a parabola, and
I'll make its height one.

97
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,320
And then there'll
be another function.

98
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,090
If I had another
color I could draw it.

99
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,610
Well, I'll just do it
with broken lines, maybe.

100
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,720
So there'll be another
bubble function in here,

101
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,970
a third bubble function
in the third interval,

102
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,180
and a fourth in the
fourth interval.

103
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:50,280
You see that I've now got
my old phi_1, phi_3, phi_5,

104
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,110
and phi_7 were
the hat functions.

105
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:59,910
But now I've got a phi_2,
phi_4, phi_6, and phi_8 that

106
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,980
are these new trial functions.

107
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,940
So part of the
message is, we can

108
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,410
throw in additional functions.

109
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,280
They don't have
to be polynomials,

110
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,000
but those are the
simplest choices.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,410
Why are they simple?

112
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,310
Because, you remember, that in
the end when I made the choice,

113
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,320
I have to do various
integrations.

114
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,940
So you remember that I have to
integrate to find entries K_ij.

115
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,150
Do you remember what that
integral looked like?

116
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,790
You certainly remember F_i.

117
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:43,790
That was the integral from zero
to one of whatever function

118
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:50,850
phi_i we had, times the
f(x)dx, times the load.

119
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,710
And we computed these.

120
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,800
You remember we computed these
for the piecewise linear guys.

121
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,380
But I don't think I wrote
down the expression that we

122
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,080
were really doing, so
let me just do that.

123
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:22,170
It's c(x), there's a du--
No. d phi_j/dx and a dV_i/dx.

124
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,890


125
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,020
Those were the integrals
that we had to do.

126
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,320
And we were taking phis
to be the same as V's.

127
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,210
Maybe I'll just do that here,
because I don't plan to make

128
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,990
any other choices
at all. d phi_i/dx.

129
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,190


130
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,770
It's a symmetric matrix now.

131
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:52,840
K_ji, because when I'm
choosing phis the same

132
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,340
as the V's, this is
what it looks like,

133
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,120
and if I switch j and i, I
don't see any difference.

134
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,920
So these are the things
that have to be integrated.

135
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,160
And those are the
ones we did integrate

136
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,440
when phi was piecewise linear.

137
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,090
When phi was piecewise
linear, the slope

138
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,670
was piecewise constant, and
we had really easy integrals.

139
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,810
Very easy integrals.

140
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,080
We had to pay
attention to where we

141
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,500
were was the slope on a minus
interval or on a plus interval,

142
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,460
but they were easy to compute.

143
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,190
And they led us back
to the kind of matrix

144
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,090
that we've seen before.

145
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,600
The twos and minus ones.

146
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,840
And our right hand
sides looked familiar.

147
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,980
Now, we've got new functions.

148
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,360
We still have the same formulas.

149
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,600
No change in formulas.

150
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,140
The system is really
quite successful,

151
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,530
because these are the things
that we have to compute.

152
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:02,710
So now I'll have to
integrate these parabolas,

153
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,010
these little parabolas,
half of the phis

154
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,100
will be little parabolas,
and their derivatives

155
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,610
will be linear.

156
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,300
So you see, I'll have
more calculations to do.

157
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,080
Which I don't plan to do,
but more integrations to--

158
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,650
For example, the
diagonal entry, say

159
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:31,520
2, 2, which will come from
that bubble with itself.

160
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,420
K_22, then, will be
the integral of c(x),

161
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,690
times the derivative
of that bubble, which

162
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:44,050
will be a straight line times
itself, so it would be squared.

163
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,570
And c is positive,
so this K_22 is

164
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,360
going to be some
nice positive number.

165
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,420
But we'll have to
figure out what it is.

166
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:01,900
Maybe I'll just say one fact
that we'll come back to.

167
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:08,610
That this K is symmetric
positive definite.

168
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,390
You thought it would be.

169
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,000
By using the letter K, we
kind of expected it to be.

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,120
And it will be.

171
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,620
It'll be symmetric because the
phis and the V's are the same.

172
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,970
And it turns out it's
positive definite.

173
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,860
So it's just great.

174
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,850
Just great.

175
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:35,400
We have a little more effort,
either to use a formula

176
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,840
for integrating polynomials,
or using numerical integration.

177
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,650
One way or another, and I
won't concentrate right now

178
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,450
on that point, we
get these numbers.

179
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,220
Okay.

180
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,200
Here's something
to concentrate on.

181
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,200
What kind of a
matrix K do we have?

182
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,450
Where will it be non-zero?

183
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,780
So it'll be eight
by eight, right?

184
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,190
I'll follow through
on that choice.

185
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,610
Just to say, where will
I see non-zeros here?

186
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,960
Because if you get
that point, you

187
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,300
see the way things
come together.

188
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,410
I'll just put a
little x for non-zero.

189
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,370
So K_11.

190
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,110
So what's that first row of K?

191
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,140
It's coming from the
first function, integrated

192
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,230
against itself.

193
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,050
K_11, if for 1, 1, we'll
get something there.

194
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:46,300
Will we have something
in the 1, 2 position?

195
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,820
That's my question, do we have
something in the 1, 2 position?

196
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,370
What's 1, 2?

197
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:57,110
That's this function against
the bubble function, yes?

198
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,100
Right?

199
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,690
They're non-zero
at the same place.

200
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,040
We can expect something there.

201
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,390
What about K_13?

202
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,410
That's what we've done
before, that's this one

203
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,680
against this one.

204
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,130
Yes?

205
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,640
We expect a non-zero there.

206
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,070
But then what?

207
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,600
After that, what will
the rest of that row be?

208
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,450
Zero.

209
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,660
Because that first
half hat doesn't

210
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,490
touch any of the others.

211
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,710
So let's go on.

212
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,080
Of course it'll be symmetric.

213
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,330
I know this much.

214
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:43,200
So this is the half hat row, and
this is the first bubble row.

215
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,720
Because the half hat
was phi_1 and now

216
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,710
the first bubble is phi_2.

217
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:53,020
What non-zeros do we get
in the stiffness matrix?

218
00:12:53,020 --> 00:13:00,130
Again, we could unconstruct
it entry by entry.

219
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,030
Another way to construct it
will be element by element,

220
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,500
stamp them in.

221
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,710
You're beginning to
see the idea of that.

222
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,680
So what do I get
for that bubble?

223
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,870
I just look to see which
elements touch that bubble.

224
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,870
And which ones do?

225
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:26,340
One, two and three,
and not four.

226
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,020
Right?

227
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,020
In that row, we only get
-- so from that bubble,

228
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,000
I think we only get that much.

229
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,530
Now, we're not quite
seeing the picture yet.

230
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,450
Let me go to the next hat.

231
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:45,020
The hat, phi_2, and
then I'll do the bubble.

232
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,150
Oh, no, sorry, the
hat's numbered phi_3,

233
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:53,480
and then the next bubble
is numbered phi_4.

234
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,680
Where do I get zeros?

235
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,400
You can tell me,
where do I get zeros?

236
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:05,210
From inner products, from
these guys, when i is three.

237
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:10,180
So which phis does phi
number three overlap?

238
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,210
That's all I'm asking.

239
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,550
Does it overlap number one?

240
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,460
Yes.

241
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,530
Does it overlap phi number two?

242
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,940
You want to highlight,
so we're now

243
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,100
looking at phi_3, at this hat.

244
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,790
God, where's it gone?

245
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,460
That's the one we're doing now?

246
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,640
So what does it overlap?

247
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,120
It overlaps the half hat, does
it overlap the first bubble?

248
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,970
Yes.

249
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,370
Does it overlap itself?

250
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,200
Yes.

251
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,620
Does it overlap
the second bubble?

252
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,200
Yes.

253
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,130
Does it overlap the next hat?

254
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,490
Yes.

255
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,040
And then all zeros.

256
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,110
Okay, and now do one more row.

257
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,570
Bubble four.

258
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:01,090
So now I'm looking at this
guy, this next bubble. phi_4.

259
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,880
What does that overlap?

260
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,090
Does it overlap
the first half hat?

261
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:08,850
Nope.

262
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,130
Of course, symmetry
told us that.

263
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,250
Does the second bubble
overlap the first bubble?

264
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,550
No.

265
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,480
Big point: zero there.

266
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,440
Does the second bubble
overlap the hat?

267
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,860
Yes.

268
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,920
Does the second
bubble overlap itself?

269
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,140
Certainly, on the diagonal
we have something.

270
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,840
Does the second bubble
overlap the next hat, phi_5?

271
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,900
Yes.

272
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,140
And that's it.

273
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,860
I think.

274
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,680
The second level does not
overlap the following bubble.

275
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,170
I don't know if you see what
pattern we're getting here.

276
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,590
Those were special rows, because
that was only a half hat.

277
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,960
These are typical rows.

278
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:03,080
A typical hat function, that row
is showing us five non-zeros,

279
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,210
because it overlaps itself,
the neighboring hats,

280
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,080
and the neighboring bubbles.

281
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,210
But the bubble row
only has three,

282
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,750
because a bubble overlaps
itself, the neighboring

283
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:20,840
hat on each side, but not
the neighboring bubbles.

284
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,100
So we have only three non-zeros.

285
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,730
Do you see that the
next row will have five?

286
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,170
Will I get it right?

287
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,120
I hope so.

288
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:38,340
The next row we'll have,
I think they'd be here.

289
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,790
And then the next row will have
only three guys, maybe here,

290
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,150
here, here.

291
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,580
Well, it's certainly
a band matrix.

292
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,530
So you could say, okay,
it's a band matrix.

293
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,510
I wouldn't call it
tri-diagonal anymore.

294
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,130
If I showed you that matrix and
said, what kind of a matrix,

295
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,860
you'd say a band matrix.

296
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,500
If you wanted to tell me
that it had five bands,

297
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,740
you could maybe say
penta-diagonal, or something.

298
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,460
But it's easy to
work with, of course.

299
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,810
That's the point
of finite elements,

300
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,900
is that all the
functions are local,

301
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:28,520
so that we get all zeros when
trial functions don't overlap.

302
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,130
My additional point
was just a small one

303
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:38,570
that's not a big deal, but it's
a little bit worth noticing.

304
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:48,330
These rows with only three
entries, three non-zeros.

305
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,800
I guess what I want to say
is I have to solve eight

306
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,250
equations and eight unknowns.

307
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,880
And the normal way to do it
would be just elimination.

308
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,670
LU, that would work fine.

309
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:08,690
Start from the top,
eliminate, and you've got it.

310
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,240
And of course in one dimension,
nobody would do anything else.

311
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,130
That would be simple.

312
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,170
I just want to
say, these bubbles,

313
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:22,990
by giving me extra zeros, I
could eliminate the bubbles

314
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,470
first.

315
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,170
Can I just make this
point but not labor it?

316
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,020
I could eliminate
the bubbles first.

317
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:39,520
I could use this equation to
express the bubble coefficient

318
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,190
in terms of its neighbors.

319
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,770
I could use this one to
express the bubble coefficient

320
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,220
in terms of it neighbors.

321
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,500
And I could plug back
into the other equations.

322
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,310
I could simplify this.

323
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,250
I could get the bubbles
done first if I wanted.

324
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:03,320
I can see that to go
into the gory details

325
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,290
is probably not wise.

326
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,340
But bubbles are easy to do.

327
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:17,390
However there are
better elements.

328
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,500
So that's my discussion
of quadratic elements,

329
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,400
almost complete.

330
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,750
It's not a big favorite,
because cubics are better.

331
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,810
So why are cubics better?

332
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,050
Why are cubics better?

333
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,470
So you're going to say,
okay, upgrade to cubics.

334
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,970
How shall I do that?

335
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,590
And I want to say a word
about the error here.

336
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,700
Of course, the
reason quadratics are

337
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,800
better than cubics-- Sorry,
the reason why quadratics

338
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,050
are better than
linear, and cubics

339
00:19:52,050 --> 00:20:00,850
will be better than quadratics
is I'm getting more accuracy.

340
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:06,360
Suppose my true solution
may be some curve like that.

341
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,190
Okay.

342
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,510
My piecewise linear
elements, suppose

343
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,350
the piecewise linear
elements happen to be,

344
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:19,690
as they would in a special model
problem, right on the money,

345
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,930
at the nodes.

346
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,410
Usually they won't be.

347
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,410
But what would be the
error in that one?

348
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,370
Well, no error at all at
the nodes as I've drawn it.

349
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,840
But that's not what
I'm interested in.

350
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,810
I'm interested in,
how big is that?

351
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:42,740
How far off is the displacement?

352
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,260
What's the maximum error
in the displacement?

353
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,460
Do you have any idea?

354
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,440
If this is size h.

355
00:20:51,440 --> 00:21:01,950
Delta x, shall I call
it delta x, or h?

356
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:08,430
How far does a curving function
escape from the-- I need

357
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,420
to blow that up, don't I?

358
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:15,320
So I have a curving function
and a linear function,

359
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,270
and I want to know
how far apart they

360
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:21,800
are over a distance
of length delta x.

361
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,920
What's this scale?

362
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,180
That's the question.

363
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,990
It's just good, it'll
have a simple answer

364
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,010
and it's great to know it.

365
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,530
Anybody want to make a guess?

366
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,360
Is that scale of size delta x?

367
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,980
Is it of size delta x
squared, size delta x cubed?

368
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,300
It's that exponent of
delta x that is telling me

369
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,730
how big is the error?

370
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,860
And it's easy to find once
you get the hang of it.

371
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,630
Anybody want to make a guess?

372
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,350
Delta x?

373
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,990
Squared.

374
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,020
Squared would be
the right guess.

375
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:07,580
Squared would be
the right guess.

376
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:13,550
I could just turn that picture,
if we wanted, to-- Again, this

377
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,190
is delta x.

378
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,100
Now it would look like
that, pretty much.

379
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,910
Doesn't have to be
symmetric, of course,

380
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,920
because this could be
a complicated function.

381
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,750
But when I focus on a
little delta x interval,

382
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:38,460
every function looks
like a little polynomial.

383
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,280
The error there, let's see.

384
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:55,000
What would that function be?

385
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,910
I could go forever on this.

386
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,520
But look, if the
slope is something,

387
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,990
whatever, let me
change numbers here.

388
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,500
Let me call it from
zero to y, what

389
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:18,020
would be a little parabola
that has a slope of one,

390
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,440
let's say, at both ends.

391
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,360
What would that parabola be?

392
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,190
We probably have
seen that before.

393
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:33,990
If I wanted a slope
of one at both ends,

394
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,580
the polynomial
would be something

395
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,540
like-- What would it be?

396
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,590
Sorry, tell me that
little polynomial.

397
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,940
It's a polynomial in x,
it's just a quadratic.

398
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:52,190
Its slope is one, so it
maybe starts with an x.

399
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,400
I've got to bring it down here.

400
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:02,080
Is it x times one
minus x over-- I

401
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,774
didn't like y ever
in the first place.

402
00:24:07,774 --> 00:24:08,940
What do I want to put there?

403
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,520
I don't want to put a one.

404
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:18,240
That would make it
look big. y is there.

405
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,930
Okay, I think that
quadratic is zero at zero,

406
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,520
because of that term.

407
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,160
It's zero at x=y,
because of that term.

408
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,710
It's second degree.

409
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,270
And I think its height
is a maximum right there.

410
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,680
And what is that height?

411
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,120
At y/2, this is
y/2, this is y/2.

412
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,470
That height is y
squared over four.

413
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,810
That's what I was shooting for.

414
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,210
The square.

415
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,690
That, in a little interval of
length y, for length delta x,

416
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,770
if I draw a little parabola
and I'm matching at the ends,

417
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:02,040
then the height it
reaches is like y squared.

418
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,180
That's the scale.

419
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:09,760
So my conclusion is that if I
use these basic hat function

420
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:17,330
elements, the error I get
is-- So can I list the errors?

421
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:22,190
The error is delta x squared.

422
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,700
That's the displacement error.

423
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,610
The error in u.

424
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,330
I'm not proving anything.

425
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,390
The careful discussion
of the accuracy

426
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,590
is a later section in the book.

427
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,900
But I'm trying to
make the main point,

428
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,370
is that if we're fitting
functions by straight lines,

429
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,540
then we have an error
of delta x squared.

430
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,350
And what's the slope error?

431
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:56,390
What do you think
is the slope error?

432
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,980
Because for us that
slope is important.

433
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,170
That's the error in the
stretching and the strain.

434
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,130
So the error in the
function is delta x squared.

435
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:10,600
The error in the slope will be
one order less, just delta x.

436
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,200
Okay, I'll come
back to all this.

437
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,920
Now, make a guess.

438
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:23,810
Suppose I include
these bubble functions.

439
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:30,780
With delta x as my length
scale horizontally,

440
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,220
what will be the
scale of the error?

441
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:38,930
What do you guess is the
expected error in displacement

442
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:44,610
for a general problem, for
a general c(x) and f(x).

443
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,560


444
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,160
Which I won't get exactly right,
but how close will I come?

445
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,040
I'll come within
delta x to what power?

446
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,410
Make a guess, please.

447
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,020
Four is an optimist.

448
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,861
I won't get up to four.

449
00:27:02,861 --> 00:27:03,360
Cubed.

450
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,490
I'd only get cubed.

451
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:10,330
I'll get one by increasing
the degree of the polynomial

452
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:15,160
by one, I'll get
one degree better.

453
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:20,380
So you could look
at it this way.

454
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,820
Suppose I have any function.

455
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,500
This is a another way to
think about the accuracy.

456
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,210
Suppose I have
any function F(x).

457
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,340


458
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:37,920
The whole point of calculus
is that I could start,

459
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:46,600
if I start where it is at zero,
then I add in F'(0), the slope,

460
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,990
times x.

461
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:54,480
Then I add in 1/2 F''(0)
times x squared, and so on.

462
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,120
Right?

463
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,000
It's called the Taylor series.

464
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,990
And we're not paying any
attention to convergence,

465
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,080
or high order.

466
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,380
It's the early terms
that I'm interested in.

467
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,440
And the point is that
if my functions include

468
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,380
linear functions,
which the hats did,

469
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,010
they will be able to
get these terms right,

470
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,950
and this will be the
error that I missed.

471
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,840
I'm just looking to see what's
the first term in the Taylor

472
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,240
series that I will not get.

473
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,890
And if I only have
hat functions,

474
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,520
I can't get an x squared.

475
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,050
I can't get a parabola.

476
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:41,390
But when I go here and
include the x squareds,

477
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,060
I can get that term right.

478
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,040
So then it'll be the 1/6
f triple prime x cubed

479
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,220
that I miss.

480
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:55,240
So the error will be
the next missing term.

481
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,550
Okay, so that's thoughts
about the error.

482
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:04,010
And of course that's why those
elements are better than these.

483
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,050
They take more work,
but they are worth it.

484
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,870
But now I want to tell you
about the next elements.

485
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,680
Cubics.

486
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,600
Where you're going to expect
to get delta x to the fourth.

487
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,250
So now we're getting
serious accuracy.

488
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,740
Now we're getting good accuracy.

489
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,230
Of course our problem is not
the most difficult problem.

490
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,740
It's in 1-D. But this is good.

491
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,540
Okay.

492
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,620
This was now the fun in the
golden age of finite elements.

493
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,900
To construct cubics.

494
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,860
What shall I use as basis
functions for cubics?

495
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,240
So I want to have a
cubic in each piece.

496
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,870
First of all suppose I just
want no more than that.

497
00:29:54,870 --> 00:30:02,150
Suppose I'm happy with
just continuous functions

498
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:06,270
and I let the slope jump.

499
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,830
What new trial function
shall I put in?

500
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,160
So I'm going to put in
new trial functions.

501
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,570
What will they look like?

502
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,910
Little cubics?

503
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,490
Little third degree pieces.

504
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:23,430
Instead of parabolas, they'll be
little pieces of third degree.

505
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:27,850
And I could put in
four more bubbles.

506
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,020
Four cubic bubbles.

507
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:37,450
So I would be up to
twelve degrees, twelve

508
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,180
by twelve matrices,
twelve functions.

509
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,850
And for that size delta x,
that would give me delta

510
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,830
x to the fourth.

511
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,780
So that would be okay.

512
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,360
There's a better idea.

513
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,530
You can see that I left space.

514
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:59,470
I'm going to make the
slope also continuous.

515
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,850
I'm not going to
allow jumps in slope.

516
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,400
Think, how will I do that?

517
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,280
So I'm going to call those
C-- what will I call that when

518
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,600
the slope is continuous?

519
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,490
The first derivative,
I'll call that C one,

520
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,280
continuous first derivative.

521
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,070
Okay.

522
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,040
Now I'm actually in
section 3.2, where

523
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,050
these better elements,
these really nifty elements

524
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,870
are constructed.

525
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,740
C^1, continuous slope, cubics.

526
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,330
Okay.

527
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,540
Ready for those?

528
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,940
What shall be my trial function
for continuous slope cubics?

529
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,750
So I have to start again.

530
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:44,090
I have to start again because
the hat functions are out now.

531
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,460
Those hat functions
have a jump in slope.

532
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:53,520
The bubble functions
have a jump in slope.

533
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:59,640
I'm rethinking here to
create a better element.

534
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,140
Okay.

535
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:05,610
So let's just think, if
we've got a chance at it,

536
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,200
how could these elements work?

537
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,590
Okay, so here is the idea, then.

538
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:15,490
Here is my interval.

539
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:18,370
Zero to one, and here's
a typical interval.

540
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:22,190
And now at a typical
node, like node one,

541
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:27,040
I plan to have as unknowns
the height of the function, as

542
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,730
before, and also the slope.

543
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:33,270
So I want the function,
my trial function

544
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:38,850
is going to have some
height and some slope.

545
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,540
And at node two,
it's going to have

546
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,380
some height and some slope.

547
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,310
And here's the question.

548
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,080
Here's the good point.

549
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:55,390
That those four numbers, the
two heights and the two slopes,

550
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:00,200
that gives me four
things, four quantities.

551
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,720
How many quantities do I
need to determine a cubic?

552
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,390
So by a cubic, of course,
I mean by a cubic something

553
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:14,400
like a_0 plus a_1 x plus a_2
x squared and a_3 x cubed.

554
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,050
It's called a cubic
because it's x cubed.

555
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,281
So how many numbers here?

556
00:33:20,281 --> 00:33:20,780
Four.

557
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,200
Perfect match.

558
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,160
There's exactly
one cubic that has

559
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,440
a specified height and a
specified slope at these two

560
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,490
ends.

561
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,910
There's one cubic
that'll do that.

562
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,220
And then whatever
the height here is

563
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,700
and whatever the slope
there is, there'll

564
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,180
be one cubic with that
height and that slope

565
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,650
that comes into this one.

566
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:48,360
And you see that they will
have continuous slope.

567
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,820
Because of course the slope
is continuous in between;

568
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,470
it's a polynomial.

569
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,990
The question is
always at the nodes.

570
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,660
But I use the same number
coming from the left

571
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,930
and from the right.

572
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:05,250
The slope has become
an extra unknown.

573
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,420
The slope has become
an extra unknown.

574
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,110
So I have height,
slope at every point.

575
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:17,400
So that's one way to describe
these trial functions now.

576
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:27,840
The trial functions have height
and also slope at each node.

577
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,890
So what does that mean?

578
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,820
That means that I'm going
to have two unknowns.

579
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,630
Two functions, two
trial functions,

580
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:40,210
each with its own
coefficient at each node.

581
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:45,170
So if I take a typical node
there, I want two functions.

582
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:49,230
Okay, this is interesting.

583
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,650
But you see what I'm creating.

584
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:55,780
I think I'm going to
get two functions there,

585
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,610
two functions there,
two functions there,

586
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,150
two functions there, right?

587
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,110
Because nobody's
constraining that.

588
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,320
So I'm up to eight.

589
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,160
And how many
functions do you think

590
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,400
I'm going to have
associated with that node?

591
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,140
Only one.

592
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,100
Why?

593
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,950
Because the height is fixed.

594
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:20,270
So I think I've got nine
trial functions here.

595
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,330
And if we can see
what those are,

596
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,030
then the system will take over.

597
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:29,700
They're my phi_1
to phi_9, whatever,

598
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,740
they plug in here, they
plug in the right-hand side,

599
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:37,680
I'll have a nine by
nine stiffness matrix.

600
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,920
It'll be local again.

601
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,100
Well, let's see if we can
figure out these functions.

602
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,030
Okay, so you have the idea?

603
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,190
I'm expecting two
trial functions.

604
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,240
One is sort of a round hat.

605
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,490
All right, let me draw that.

606
00:35:54,490 --> 00:36:02,720
The round hat function
will be the function--

607
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:10,740
These will be the round hats,
and they'll be associated with,

608
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,190
they give me heights.

609
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:19,040
And then I'll also
have an additional one,

610
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,000
except at the last node.

611
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,620
And these will be-- I don't
know what to call them yet.

612
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,340
You'll have to give me a name.

613
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,950
These will give me the slopes.

614
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,630
Okay.

615
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,520
So what does a
round hat look like?

616
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,110
Now these have to
be, follow my rules,

617
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,290
they have to be
continuous, their slope

618
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,850
has to be continuous.

619
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,430
And I want to take the one
that has height one and zero

620
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,750
slope there.

621
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:47,190
And it should have height
zero and zero slope, here.

622
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:52,460
Height zero, zero slope.

623
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,330
You see what it's going to be?

624
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,760
This phi, whatever
number it is, it'll

625
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,070
be the phi whose
coefficient tells me

626
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,130
the height at node one.

627
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,670
So here's node one.

628
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,700
What will it look like?

629
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,270
What will this function do?

630
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:16,270
Well, there is
exactly one cubic that

631
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,260
starts from zero with
slope zero and ends there,

632
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,470
ends at one with slope zero.

633
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:21,970
Right?

634
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:26,590
That's what we said; four
numbers determine that cubic

635
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,300
in that interval.

636
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:34,160
Then there's another cubic that,
with those two numbers again,

637
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,532
that keeps the continuous
slope, and these two numbers

638
00:37:37,532 --> 00:37:38,240
in this interval.

639
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,880
And of course it'll
just be symmetric.

640
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,020
You see the round hat?

641
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,710
So that's the basis
function, the trial

642
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,980
function that has continuous
slopes and heights, of course,

643
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,370
and it has height
one at that point.

644
00:37:55,370 --> 00:38:01,100
And now let me draw the one that
has height zero, slope zero;

645
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,090
height zero, slope zero.

646
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:10,610
And what do I want
it to do there?

647
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:16,370
What should this
function be like?

648
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,510
It should be the one that
tells-- Its coefficient will

649
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,230
tell me the slope.

650
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:28,390
So I want it to have a slope
of one and a height of zero.

651
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,180
Do you see these
functions, shall

652
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,560
I call these, the height
functions, phi h 1?

653
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,660
That's the phi, that's the
trial function that tells me

654
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,780
the height at node one.

655
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,740
When I take
combinations, it gets

656
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:51,270
multiplied by U h 1, which is
exactly the height at node one.

657
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,090
Now what about this guy?

658
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:58,640
This guy is going to start
with zero slope at zero.

659
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,810
It's going to be a cubic,
and there's exactly

660
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,180
one cubic that'll do it.

661
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,800
It'll look a little like this.

662
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,860
Then there'll be
exactly one cubic

663
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,360
that does that and
gets back to zero.

664
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,260
You see that that's possible?

665
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,480
In each interval,
I've got four numbers:

666
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,210
two heights, two slopes.

667
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:23,540
So this would be a picture
of the phi slope at node one

668
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,290
function.

669
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:30,280
So that's a standard function,
it's a cubic, piecewise cubic.

670
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,200
Local again, because in all
these intervals it's zero.

671
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,110
And it will be, when I
go to take combinations

672
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,390
of all these guys,
it'll be multiplied

673
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:43,910
by its coefficient, U slope one.

674
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:48,420
And then I'll have
nine altogether.

675
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,950
But those two are
the typical ones.

676
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:57,650
Do you do see how that's going?

677
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:03,460
It's more subtle
than hat functions.

678
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:09,950
Suppose whoever's writing
the finite element code

679
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:16,510
gets a formula for those
phis and plugs them

680
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:23,600
into the integrals, comes
out with a stiffness matrix.

681
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,750
Actually, we could even look
at that stiffness matrix.

682
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,810
This is a good way to
understand the picture.

683
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,900
Now it'll be nine by nine.

684
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,130
Right?

685
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:41,080
So here we'll have a typical,
this'll be our phi height 1

686
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,630
row, and this'll be
our phi slope 1 row,

687
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,970
and this'll be our phi
height 2 row, and so on.

688
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:53,590
Of course, I didn't
leave room for all--

689
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:59,710
What will a typical row of this
stiffness matrix have in it?

690
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,750
I'm just asking about the
overlaps. phi_1 height

691
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,970
certainly overlaps itself.

692
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,730
Does phi_1 height
overlap phi_1 slope?

693
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,690
Yes or no?

694
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,450
Sure.

695
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,350
Sure.

696
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:21,580
Does phi_1 height
overlap phi_2 height?

697
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,030
Yes.

698
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,650
Yes.

699
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:28,910
Because the phi_2 height
will go up like that.

700
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:29,540
You see?

701
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,840
And the phi_2 slope.

702
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:38,920
So actually we'll have,
I think we'll have

703
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,600
six non-zeros on a typical row.

704
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,560
Is that right?

705
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,880
Six non-zeros?

706
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,650
Because a typical h-- this
is maybe not so typical,

707
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,040
because to the left of
it there's only one,

708
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,140
there's no-- No, there are two.

709
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,050
Right?

710
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,520
There's a phi_0, phi
h 0 and a phi s 0.

711
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,210
Sure, there are two
here, the two guys

712
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:11,350
here, there's one
height guy, and there's

713
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:17,350
one-- what's cooking in that?

714
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:21,970
Oh, it's got a slope of one
and it gets back to zero.

715
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,040
What I'm drawing now
in little dashed lines

716
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,370
was the phi slope 0.

717
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:32,830
The one that gives
me a slope at node

718
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,000
zero, and this is the one
that gives me a height.

719
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,050
Yes.

720
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:40,910
Do you see it?

721
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:46,040
So above this was a phi
slope 0, and stuck in there

722
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:54,680
was a phi height 0.

723
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,190
Six-diagonal matrix.

724
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:02,310
I think it helps to draw
that little thing with x's

725
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,630
and zeros, because then you sort
of see how things are fitting

726
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:06,700
together.

727
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,020
Okay.

728
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:18,360
So these functions now, I've
gone into section 3.2 for that.

729
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,420
I want to go to a
slightly different topic,

730
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:28,130
and then I'll come back in
section 3.2 to these cubics.

731
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,350
So these are C^1 cubics,
continuous slope cubics.

732
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:35,460
Very interesting construction.

733
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,110
Are you seeing how it could
go in more dimensions?

734
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:45,040
I mean, that's what we'll
see for Laplace's equation,

735
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,310
how can you construct
quadratics, cubics in a plane.

736
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,210
It gets interesting.

737
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:56,340
But you'll get the
knack of these guys.

738
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:02,920
These are pretty
direct, and very useful.

739
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,280
So what's the effect?

740
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,990
The effect is that
we get a matrix.

741
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:13,710
It looks quite like
a difference matrix.

742
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,740
Well, actually, the height
rows and-- the numbers

743
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,180
in the height rows and the
slope rows look different.

744
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,880
We're getting
something new here.

745
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,800
We're getting a matrix, a KU=F,
that's going to give us fourth

746
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,860
order accuracy.

747
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:37,500
So the accuracy has moved up.

748
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,720
So we've got up to
fourth order accuracy,

749
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,830
which we could get
by finite differences

750
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:47,190
by a lot of patience.

751
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:50,360
We get them from finite
elements in a straight way.

752
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,010
Okay, any question
or discussion?

753
00:44:53,010 --> 00:45:00,040
I'm talking real fast to get
this new idea of constructing

754
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,000
finite elements here.

755
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:13,190
I do want to say
something about that line.

756
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:17,070
Because that's a
part of this business

757
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:21,040
of estimating the accuracy.

758
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:28,670
It's a key idea in the
background of the Galerkin

759
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,380
method.

760
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:34,490
And the minimum form would
be associated with names

761
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:37,060
like Rayleigh and Ritz.

762
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:37,930
All right.

763
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:42,610
I'll just go directly
to that, if I may.

764
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:49,940
So what I want to do is tell
you, for our model problem,

765
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:58,970
I want to tell you the strong
form-- Let me do it this way.

766
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:03,720
I'll put the strong
form, the weak form,

767
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:09,610
and then I want to add
in the minimum form.

768
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,340
Okay.

769
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,720
So the strong form of
our equation was minus

770
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,190
the derivative of
c*du/dx equal f.

771
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:24,670


772
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:28,180
Okay.

773
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:33,460
What was the weak form?

774
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,070
This is an f(x).

775
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:39,880
The weak form, how do
you get to the weak form?

776
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,110
You multiply both sides by a
test function, you integrate,

777
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:47,980
you integrate by parts, and you
get this beautifully symmetric

778
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:57,250
form that we have up
there, du/dx*dv/dx*dx,

779
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,490
equals the integral
of f(x)*v(x)*dx.

780
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:03,740


781
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,060
I write that again, just so
you see the nice symmetry

782
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,280
of that weak form.

783
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:21,470
And it's for all test
functions v. Okay.

784
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,500
I'm shooting for a
third description.

785
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,760
A third description
of the same problem.

786
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,600
And it's really neat to
see that you have that.

787
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,870
Let me just see it first
in the discrete case.

788
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:40,680
The discrete case, the strong
form would be A transpose C

789
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,940
Au=f.

790
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,430
That's the strong form.

791
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,030
Right?

792
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:50,430
I always like to see
the discrete one first,

793
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,100
and then the continuous.

794
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,840
Okay, what would be the weak
form in the discrete case?

795
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,560
I would multiply by
a vector v, and I

796
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:04,180
would take inner products, A
transpose C Au inner product

797
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:11,745
with v, equals f inner product
with v. You can use dot,

798
00:48:11,745 --> 00:48:18,350
or-- So that would
be the weak form.

799
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:21,070
I've just taken the dot
product of both sides

800
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:27,931
with v. Now you'll see the weak
form better if, what should I

801
00:48:27,931 --> 00:48:28,430
do?

802
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:32,640
What would make that look nice?

803
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,450
So that's the dot product
of A transpose C Au with v.

804
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:41,890
And what do I do to
make that look nice?

805
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:44,420
Do you get the idea yet?

806
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,640
It doesn't look pretty to me.

807
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,820
It's all lopsided.

808
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:50,450
Right?

809
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:53,200
So what can I do
with A transpose?

810
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,700
What's the rule
about A transpose?

811
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,890
That if I have A
transpose times something,

812
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:02,610
dotted with something,
what can I do?

813
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:08,640
I can move the A transpose
over to the other guy.

814
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,230
And what will it
be when I do that?

815
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:19,280
So I take it away from here,
and what do I put there?

816
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,970
A. That's the whole
point of transposes.

817
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:28,480
Transposes, you put them on the
other side of the dot product,

818
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,020
you take the transpose, so
it would be literally, maybe

819
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,750
A transpose
transpose, which is A.

820
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:37,620
What I just did there
is integration by parts.

821
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,800
Well, summation by
parts, because I'm

822
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,170
in the discrete case.

823
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:44,240
The whole idea of
integration by parts

824
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,110
amounted to taking A transpose
off of u, off of this,

825
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:51,820
and putting A over there.

826
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,810
Isn't that neat?

827
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:58,420
And you see that this CAu,
Av is just what I have here.

828
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:03,450
C, A is derivative,
so this is CAu, Av.

829
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:07,540
Inner product.

830
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,730
That's cool.

831
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:13,710
That's just like
how it should be.

832
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:17,270
I just followed that rule,
that A transpose times

833
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:22,540
something, shall I call it
w, inner product with u,

834
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:26,630
is the same as (w, Au).

835
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,650
That if I bring
A transpose over,

836
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,300
it becomes an A. If
I bring an A over,

837
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,140
it would become an A transpose.

838
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,880
All right, what about
the minimum form?

839
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,320
Have I got one minute
to do the minimum form?

840
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,130
Yes.

841
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:44,220
So what's the minimization
that's hiding behind this?

842
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:49,570
The minimization in the
discrete case, do you remember?

843
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:53,050
We're looking at Ku=f.

844
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:57,860
And some quadratic quantity from
least squares has its minimum

845
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,230
when Ku=f.

846
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:07,170
And it's 1/2 u transpose
Ku minus u transpose f.

847
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:11,620
Where K is A transpose C A.
This is the minimum statement

848
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,620
of the problem.

849
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:17,810
That if I look for the u that
minimizes that quadratic,

850
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:21,190
it leads me to
the equation Ku=f.

851
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:22,860
So that's the minimum statement.

852
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:27,330
And if we want it to really
look perfectly like the others,

853
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:39,510
I would put in A
transpose C A. Okay.

854
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:42,720
Can I write down next time,
because our time is really up.

855
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,120
It's not fair to-- Al I'm
going to do is write down

856
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,680
the same thing here.

857
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,280
I'm minimizing 1/2-- Oh,
I'm going to do it anyway.

858
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:58,790
c(x) du/dx squared, minus
the integral of f(x)u(x).

859
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:02,470


860
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:05,130
So that's the minimum problem.

861
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:12,400
Minimize over all
u, this quadratic.

862
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,080
This is the right way
to see these problems.

863
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,450
You see a differential
equation, which

864
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,820
we use for finite
differences; you

865
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,090
see a weak form, which we
use for finite elements;

866
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,340
and now you see a minimum form.

867
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,540
Okay, that gives you
something to think about.

868
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,180
And there'll be a homework
on finite elements

869
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,370
that'll give you a
chance to use them.

870
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,300
Okay, thank you.
