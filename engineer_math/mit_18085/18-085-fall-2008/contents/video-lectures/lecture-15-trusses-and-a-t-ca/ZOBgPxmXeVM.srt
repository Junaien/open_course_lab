9
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:20,930
PROFESSOR STRANG: Alright.

10
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,290
So this is Lecture 15.

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,530
It's the last topic, today and
Friday, like just 15 and 16.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,630
Trusses within Chapter 2.

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,480
The last topic we'll do
for discrete systems.

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,810
Then it's a lot of fun.

15
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:48,620
I wanted to say a few words
first about last night's exam.

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,720
Several words first.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,920
Overall, I'm sure
it's going to be fine.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,430
Ramis is grading the
first two problems,

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,590
he'll pass them to
Peter for the next two.

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,140
And I'll get them back.

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,180
I'm pretty sure
it'll be next week.

22
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,490
I felt it was a fair
exam, except I should

23
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:18,220
have done a better job in
helping you with the matrix A.

24
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,700
Especially in problem one.

25
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm glad that hint was
there, the matrix A_0, that

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,150
goes with free-free, to sort
of say what kind of matrix

27
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,570
to be looking for.

28
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:42,450
And I thought I'd just repeat,
make the connections that I

29
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,700
should have made earlier.

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,800
So we all see the
point about these.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,350
These A's and the
A transpose A's.

32
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,050
So if I take, for that
A_0, free-free one.

33
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,130
Everybody sees that this is--
And this connects of course

34
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,650
with our graphs.

35
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,650
Our graph is just this
simple graph with well

36
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,840
actually is that how
many, is it five nodes?

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,810
I guess there are five.

38
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,760
Because as it stands I have one,
two, three, four, five columns,

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:32,180
I've got five u's,
u_0 down to u_4.

40
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,030
And if I take A_0
transpose A_0, that

41
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,640
would be the free-free matrix.

42
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,150
What size would it be?

43
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,320
And what matrix would it be?

44
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,580
Just if we do that
multiplication,

45
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,170
this is a first
difference matrix.

46
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,670
When I do A_0
transpose A_0 I'll get

47
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,740
one of our second
difference matrices.

48
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,120
So it'll be one of
our special ones.

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,980
Which special one would it be?

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,480
B. It'll be the matrix B
that has both ends free.

51
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,110
And what size will it be?

52
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:14,230
I guess it'll be five by five.

53
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,380
That's right; that would be
five by four times A_0, which

54
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,520
is four by five.

55
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,380
So it'll be the five by five
matrix B. Can I call it B_5?

56
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,580
OK.

57
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,020
So that was there as a hint.

58
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,480
That isn't the correct
matrix for problem one

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,100
because problem one
was fixed-fixed.

60
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,930
Let's get there in two steps.

61
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,240
Suppose it's fixed-free.

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,600
So suppose I make u_0 equal 0.

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,340
So I ground the top node,
I support the top node--

64
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,110
Oh no, shall I do u_0?

65
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,670
Yeah.

66
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,790
I'll do u_0.

67
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,700
So that would
knock out this one.

68
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,870
If I say fix u_0, say,
at zero or whatever.

69
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:09,910
Now I've got, the next A, I
won't call it A_0 anymore.

70
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:16,550
So now four by four, now
if I do A transpose A,

71
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,510
which of our special
matrices am I going to get?

72
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:26,170
T. It'll be T. It'll be
the one that has the first,

73
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,110
the (1, 1) entry
will only be a one.

74
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,490
So that'll be the
fixed-free matrix.

75
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,900
It'll be of what size?

76
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,010
Four.

77
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,380
Now I've only got four
unknowns. u_1 to u_4.

78
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,650
OK, that still is not
what problem one is.

79
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,910
Problem one was fixed-fixed.

80
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,850
So as I did in the review,
that would knock out

81
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,840
both of these columns.

82
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:59,850
So this now is the matrix that I
was looking for in problem one,

83
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,750
and I wish I had emphasized
these steps in advance.

84
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,130
I apologize.

85
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,330
OK, so what fixed-fixed if,
without the C part in it.

86
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,120
Just focusing on the A, what
fixed-fixed matrix would I get?

87
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,330
Which one of our
guys would it be?

88
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,570
K of size three.

89
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:29,880
And while we're at it, what
would be the story, how would

90
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,390
I get one of these
circular ones, which

91
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,640
is sort of on our special list.

92
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,040
For Fourier it's the
really special guy.

93
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:47,750
So a circular one I'm going
to connect u_4 back to u_0.

94
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,190
So I'm going to put
these guys back in.

95
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,780
And what else would change, if
u_4 was connected back to u_0,

96
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,960
now I'm aiming for
this circulant.

97
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,450
What matrix A is going
to give me the circulant?

98
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,980
So again, these guys
are the A transpose A's.

99
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,500
This over here was the A, and
over here is the A transpose A.

100
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,800
And now I want to
fix A, and then

101
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,550
I want to see that A
transpose A. So suppose

102
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,310
I give you that graph, then.

103
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,520
Oops, I should have, well.

104
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,770
Just connect the whole guy.

105
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,790
So fifth node coming
back to the first.

106
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,890
So that's my circle of nodes.

107
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,140
That's a simple graph.

108
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:49,240
What's the A_circulant now?

109
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,500
So this would be the A
for the circulant case.

110
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,590
So it's got that back in.

111
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,020
That shouldn't be erased,
that shouldn't be erased.

112
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,930
And what else has it got?

113
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,610
If I ask you for the incidence
matrix, now I'm in Section 2.4,

114
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,530
like I've given
you a graph, or you

115
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,480
can think of masses and
springs in a circle.

116
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,660
So I've got five
masses, five springs.

117
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:25,140
What's my matrix A missing?

118
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,070
It needs another row.

119
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,690
We just put in another
edge, it needs another row.

120
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:39,350
That edge went from the last
node back to the first node.

121
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:45,510
So we've got a fifth row.

122
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,090
So you see, now it
really is circulant.

123
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,430
I would call this one
also a circulant matrix.

124
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:58,750
The diagonals are constant.

125
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,850
That's what I and MATLAB
and everybody else

126
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,620
would call a Toeplitz matrix,
and the command toeplitz

127
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,740
could create this.

128
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,460
That diagonal is constant.

129
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,620
That diagonal is constant.

130
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,590
The other diagonals
are constant.

131
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,600
But more than that,
what's additional

132
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,080
here in the circulant,
which is the thing that

133
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,500
makes Fourier happy?

134
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,930
The diagonal circles around.

135
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,430
That diagonal has only
got four entries in it,

136
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,190
but it circles around
sort of periodically

137
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,030
to its fifth entry.

138
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,210
So that's more than Toeplitz.

139
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,820
It's circulant because
it's coming around again.

140
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,570
This we'll see in the
discrete Fourier transform.

141
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,270
It's really all good stuff.

142
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,240
And now there is my a circulant.

143
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,620
And what would be my A
transpose circulant A_circulant?

144
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,770
What would be A transpose A if
I take that five by five matrix?

145
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:09,790
C. Finally I've created, so
I've already got B, I've got T,

146
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,780
I've got K, all those
three special guys.

147
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,220
And now the A transpose
A for this circulant,

148
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,210
so that's a first difference
matrix for a periodic problem.

149
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,790
And A transpose A will
be a second difference

150
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:27,200
matrix for a periodic
problem, C_5, I guess.

151
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,305
It'll be five.

152
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:29,805
OK.

153
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:34,130
I hope that brings together
what I, if I was on the ball,

154
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,370
I would have brought it
together before the quiz.

155
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:45,030
Can I just say a few words
about the quiz and grades?

156
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,650
They come out fine.

157
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,070
Really they do.

158
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,130
I've been doing
this a long time.

159
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:59,050
And just, enjoy October.

160
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,760
I'm sorry to give
you any exam at all,

161
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,230
but it's a chance for you yeah,
I'm working on this stuff.

162
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,590
I'm learning it.

163
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,940
Everybody didn't
learn it first time.

164
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,820
I don't learn it
first time, every time

165
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,080
I teach the course I
learn something more.

166
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,400
And if you're learning from this
course then I'm totally happy.

167
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,430
And I believe that's the case.

168
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,380
So I am entirely happy.

169
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:32,120
And I hope the quiz,
some points of it

170
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,030
I wish I'd prepared better.

171
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:39,740
But I feel pretty good about it.

172
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,680
I feel good about
it, let me just say.

173
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,340
So, and I'm happy to have any
comments, email or in person.

174
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,740
But allow me to go
forward with trusses.

175
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,980
However, I'm ready
always for a comment.

176
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,740
Yeah.

177
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,100
OK.

178
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,680
Anyway, enjoy trusses.

179
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,990
Enjoy life.

180
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,150
Yeah.

181
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,740
And this should have been
in the book, this page.

182
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,170
So if it wasn't too late
I would paste it in.

183
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,120
Because this connects
A transpose A

184
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,680
to special matrices, in
the way I had in my mind,

185
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,250
but I didn't put it on
the board until just now.

186
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:29,020
OK, so I'll cover that up
and ready to go with trusses.

187
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,180
OK.

188
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,840
So trusses, we want
to know what's up.

189
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,500
We want to get the setup right.

190
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:45,000
Once we get the setup we'll
know we're looking for.

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,100
OK, so a truss is a bunch of
elastic bars with pin joints

192
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,900
connecting them.

193
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,110
Now, what do I mean
by a pin joint?

194
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:05,570
I mean that stretching
the bars takes force.

195
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,810
Turning around the pin
joint doesn't take force.

196
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:18,130
So the pin just lets
them turn, so we'll

197
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,740
have forces in those bars.

198
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,210
So it's like masses and springs.

199
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,300
Exactly like masses and springs.

200
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,140
But yet we have a 2-D problem.

201
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,800
So it's a two
dimensional problem

202
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,340
with masses and springs.

203
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,550
And we could certainly
have a 3-D truss,

204
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,680
but 2-D makes all
the important points.

205
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,650
And then I can count the bars.

206
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,360
One, two, three, four, five.

207
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,800
And I can count the nodes.

208
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,720
There happen to be five here.

209
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,710
But now comes the moment.

210
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,370
I have to tell you,
what are the unknowns?

211
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,380
What are the u's.

212
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,090
Because of course,
you know that I'm

213
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:05,220
going to go from u's to
e's to w's, to forces, f.

214
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,780
And you know that a matrix
A is going to do that.

215
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,080
A matrix C is going to do that.

216
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,650
A matrix A transpose
is going to do that.

217
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,090
You're all ready, we need
to know what's the setup.

218
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,890
What are these matrices.

219
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,490
OK, and how many-- So
let me explain the setup.

220
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:31,630
Typical node, node one. we
have forces in these bars,

221
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:38,250
so that node one
could have a force.

222
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,960
We're in the plane.

223
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,200
So we have a horizontal
force and a vertical force.

224
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,060
Together, that would
give, produces a force

225
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,460
in any direction whatever.

226
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,880
So this is the key point.

227
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:59,340
That there is a horizontal
force. f horizontal one.

228
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,440
The one being the
force on node one.

229
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,700
But there's also
a vertical force.

230
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,940
And let me take
horizontal to the right,

231
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,510
positive to the right.

232
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,320
Vertical positive upwards.

233
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,550
Just to have a convention.

234
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,180
So how many f's have I got?

235
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,140
Well, the point is I
now have two per node.

236
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,610
That's the difference.

237
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,960
I have two per node, two forces.

238
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,480
And I have two
displacements per node.

239
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,410
Because that point under,
there will be more forces.

240
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:38,020
Some maybe pulling
this way, whatever.

241
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,030
Maybe let's look at node two.

242
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,710
So node two could have a
couple of forces on it.

243
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,420
f h two, and f v two.

244
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,000
And it moves like
the other nodes.

245
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,140
So now I'm introducing
the unknowns. u

246
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,680
is the movement. u,
again horizontal,

247
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,240
and again, now we're
talking about node two.

248
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,080
And it moves up.

249
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,870
Or doesn't, or moves down.

250
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,470
But that's an unknown.
u, a displacement,

251
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,130
a vertical displacement
of node two.

252
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,330
Do you see the setup?

253
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,350
Two forces per node.

254
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,210
Two displacements per node.

255
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:27,650
So that's like, the number
of unknown is like doubled.

256
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:33,220
Like, doubled, and that produces
an interesting situation.

257
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,180
I've marked supports here.

258
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,860
So let's just speak
about supports.

259
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,310
So what's happening
at the supports?

260
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:49,110
At the support
there's no movement.

261
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,940
The whole-- That
point is pinned.

262
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,120
So this is telling me
that u horizontal five

263
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,920
is zero and u vertical,
sorry that was four

264
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,830
and it'll be the same for
five. u vertical five is zero.

265
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,760
It's like grounding a node
in the electrical case.

266
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,580
We just see this
pattern over and over.

267
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,090
And we want to see OK, what
does it look like for trusses?

268
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,140
So here's a support
that fixes those.

269
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,090
So those are not unknowns.

270
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,480
And similarly, they're
not unknowns there.

271
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,420
Still saying five
when I mean four.

272
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:34,300
So those are boundary
conditions, n conditions,

273
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,870
whatever.

274
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,330
And similarly here.

275
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,500
So how many unknowns are there?

276
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,120
Now look at this picture, how
many unknown displacements

277
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,830
are there in this truss?

278
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,380
Six.

279
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,320
Six, right?

280
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,180
Two here, two here, two
here and none there.

281
00:16:53,180 --> 00:17:00,520
So the number of
actual unknowns is six.

282
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:06,340
My idea would be that it's
twice the number of nodes

283
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:13,980
minus the number of fixed
things, reaction, whatever.

284
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,250
That R would be
four in this case.

285
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,490
I've got two fixed here
and two fixed here,

286
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,190
so this would be two times five.

287
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,980
Ten possible
displacements but R counts

288
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,580
the number of fixed
displacements, four,

289
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,580
and leaves us with six.

290
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,320
OK.

291
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,590
So my matrix A will now
be, it's always m by n.

292
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,880
My matrix A will be five by six.

293
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,060
OK.

294
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,340
Now you're going to ask
what is that matrix.

295
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,940
But let me hold that
off for a little moment.

296
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,910
I want to just see
its shape first.

297
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:02,160
So you could now do this
for a large truss, right?

298
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,500
You count the bars, and
you could count the nodes.

299
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,990
And then you could count the
unknown displacements, u.

300
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:17,190
So there are six u's here.

301
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,460
And there are five e's.

302
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,530
And there are five bar forces.

303
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:29,700
And there are six equilibrium,
balance, force balances.

304
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,920
Six, six for the node count,
for the unknowns count,

305
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,480
five, five for the bars count.

306
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:44,520
OK, now here's a point
about this particular truss.

307
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,440
It's not safe to get on it.

308
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,570
Right?

309
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,650
And I want to say
why is it not safe.

310
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:54,860
So this is a feature that comes
into the truss question that

311
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,040
makes it a little new
and more interesting.

312
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,850
A little twist compared
to the previous examples.

313
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,450
That bar, that truss,
I wouldn't stand on it.

314
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,150
Now, why not?

315
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,980
Well, purely for
linear algebra reasons.

316
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,230
Of course.

317
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,650
The matrix A is five by six.

318
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,840
So now what do we know about
a matrix that's five by six?

319
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,790
So A is five by six.

320
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:28,420
Five rows, as always the m;
six columns, because now we

321
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,850
have six unknowns.

322
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:36,240
And what do I know about
any five by six matrix?

323
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,400
I want to ask about
the equation Au=0.

324
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,320


325
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,810
So I want to ask about it
in linear algebra language

326
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,700
and then I want to ask about
it in physical language.

327
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,610
And the beauty is the thing
that makes trusses sort of fun

328
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,070
is, these matrices, A,
get pretty big fast.

329
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,590
Because when I put
a few more nodes on,

330
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,460
the book has a picture
of a sort of treehouse.

331
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,220
Then A is growing.

332
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,030
And I don't, all the time,
write down the matrix A.

333
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,950
I haven't written it down here.

334
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,330
What I've written
down is just its size,

335
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,540
because that's enough to tell
us something about this set

336
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,290
of equations Au=0.

337
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,200
What's the story on Au=0?

338
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,900
Well of course it
has the solution u=0.

339
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,940
Nothing moving.

340
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,710
If I have no displacement,
if the u's are all zero,

341
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,840
then I have no stretching.

342
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,290
The e's are stretching.

343
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,890
Elongation, as before.

344
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,250
How far does the bar stretch?

345
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:44,940
OK.

346
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,760
So if I have zero
u's and zero e's.

347
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:55,700
But, what other possibility
am I going to have here?

348
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,520
I'm going to have
probably one solution

349
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,800
to this system that isn't zero.

350
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,910
I'm probably going to have one
set of displacements u, look

351
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,140
what's happening here.

352
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,750
This is Au is the e.

353
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,900
So I'm going to have at least
one and probably in this case

354
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:26,530
it will be one, there will
be one, the neat word for it

355
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,930
is a mechanism.

356
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,850
And what does that mean?

357
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,000
A mechanism is a
solution to Au=0.

358
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,370
So that, a mechanism is
a movement of the bar.

359
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,410
So it's going to be non-zero.

360
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,080
The bars are going
to move a little.

361
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,060
Sorry, the nodes are
going to move a little.

362
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,180
The nodes will
move a little bit.

363
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,660
In this u, because
it isn't zero.

364
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,420
But the bars won't stretch.

365
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:04,060
So that tells us we've
got instability here.

366
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,880
If there's a solution
to that, that's

367
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,020
always telling us that A
transpose A is singular.

368
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,020
So let me just put
that A transpose A --

369
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,950
or A transpose C A, C couldn't
save it -- will be singular.

370
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:24,910
It's just like our free-free
thing in being singular,

371
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,450
but the picture doesn't
look free-free, does it?

372
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,000
It's got supports in here,
just not good enough.

373
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,190
And I believe that if
you look at this truss,

374
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,430
you could describe,
you could tell me,

375
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:47,620
and you could draw, a movement
of that truss in which

376
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,040
there is displacement
but no stretching.

377
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,560
Let me ask you how to draw that.

378
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,410
And I believe--
Everybody understood,

379
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,240
why was there a solution?

380
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,070
It was because we
have six unknowns

381
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,320
and we only have five equations.

382
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,720
So this was five equations.

383
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,640
Any time you have five
equations with a zero

384
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,540
on the right-hand side,
so five homogeneous

385
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,315
equations, whatever you
want to say when that's zero

386
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:20,190
on the right and six unknowns.

387
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,160
Six u's.

388
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,340
Then you're going
to have solution.

389
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,460
You can't help it.

390
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,990
You've got that many
degrees of freedom,

391
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,940
you've only got that
many constraints, there's

392
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,220
going to be solution.

393
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,540
OK, tell me how to draw that.

394
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,570
Let me put in the truss now.

395
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,940
What's the solution?

396
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,570
So this is the fun part
in a particular example

397
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,140
at the start.

398
00:23:52,140 --> 00:24:04,790
How could that move
without stretching bars?

399
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,340
Let me see.

400
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,690
What could happen?

401
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,400
What do you mean now,
who's going to move where?

402
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,280
What's the movement here?

403
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,830
And I want to draw
it over there.

404
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,480
So you give the answer
by drawing it as well

405
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,160
as by telling me
the six unknown u's.

406
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,300
So what can happen
at this thing?

407
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:40,200
So you're going to say the
truss could, these bars could,

408
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,630
turn a little?

409
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,750
And notice that word a little.

410
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,050
We're talking
small displacement,

411
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,980
small stretches
all the time here.

412
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,240
I'll show you why
we're always making

413
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,430
that linearity assumption,
or small assumption.

414
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,290
OK, those move a little.

415
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:05,090
And what happens to that
triangle at the top?

416
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,630
It sort of just
moves along, right?

417
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,190
So the picture you
would draw would

418
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:16,210
be that you started there.

419
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,820
And it moved along
a little, I'll

420
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:24,030
make it a larger displacement
than I really have in mind.

421
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,380
These guys of course are here.

422
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,180
So they come out and
the rest of the truss,

423
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,470
the top of the truss,
just kind of goes with it.

424
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,720
Goes with the flow.

425
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,970
That would be the answer
that I would be looking for,

426
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,720
to draw the mechanism.

427
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,230
That would show it.

428
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,970
And if I wanted to
write down the u that

429
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,450
goes with it, what would it be?

430
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,230
Let me again number these
guys; this is one, two,

431
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,780
and this is three.

432
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:02,880
So what are the displacements
of nodes one, two, and three?

433
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,940
I'll always write u_1
horizontal before vertical.

434
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,620
Can we make an agreement?

435
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,440
So I want to know about
the horizontal movement

436
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,780
then the vertical
movement of node one,

437
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,860
then node two, then node three.

438
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,080
So I'll have six numbers there.

439
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,710
And what could I put in
for those six numbers?

440
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:27,120
So the horizontal, let me
suppose that that first guy,

441
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,140
I'll put a one.

442
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,370
Really that's a bigger
number than I should put,

443
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,980
but it's a convenient number.

444
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,860
So I'll just take it to be
one even though I really

445
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,500
have in mind-- Let's say
that's one angstrom, or one

446
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,320
tiny little person.

447
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:51,820
OK, so what about the rest?

448
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:58,630
What's the vertical-- Oh yeah,
this is a key point here,

449
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,600
what's the vertical movement?

450
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,110
This movement to
me is horizontal.

451
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:09,910
I'm going to say that the
vertical moment is zero.

452
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,830
Of node one, just moves over.

453
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,780
And node two does the same.

454
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,440
And node three does the same.

455
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,840
So that's my solution.
[1, 0, 1,  0, 1, 0].

456
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,370
That's a simple movement, a
simple set of displacements,

457
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:30,820
think most to the right.

458
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,340
I have not written
down the matrix A,

459
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,610
but probably won't even
do it until next time.

460
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,320
But you will see that
when we do the matrix A

461
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,490
for this particular truss
will have this particular u

462
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,210
as a mechanism.

463
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:56,130
In linear algebra, u is in
the null space of A. Au=0,

464
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,410
that's all that means.

465
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:04,260
OK, do you see more
or less what's up?

466
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,610
But now there's one little
thing that may be bothering you.

467
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:13,070
Which is what?

468
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:18,650
If I come back to the
zero, zero, zero there,

469
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:23,520
you could correctly
say wait a minute,

470
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,590
if those bars didn't
stretch, if they just

471
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:29,170
rotated as you
told me to do, then

472
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:35,130
this was mostly across but
a little bit down, right?

473
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,570
And I'm saying no.

474
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,120
I'm saying zero.

475
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,930
OK, how do I get away with that?

476
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:47,520
So I'm saying in
18.085 it's a zero.

477
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,480
And why?

478
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,080
So this is like a little
time-out just to focus in on,

479
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,490
let me focus in on node two.

480
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:02,420
So here's the bottom
node four, so it

481
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,060
used to be vertical up to two.

482
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,920
This was node two and
this was number four.

483
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,620
And then it rotated
a little, to there.

484
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,690
To this position.

485
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,370
So it went, if this
angle was, let's say,

486
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:26,560
theta, then what is
that actual position?

487
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,760
So let's say this was, let's
say the bar had length one.

488
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,450
This is the origin, (0, 0).

489
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,760
This is the point
(0, 1) above it, OK?

490
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,280
And now, that's before it moved.

491
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,780
Then it moved a little bit.

492
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,470
It moved to an angle theta.

493
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,090
What's the position of that bar?

494
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,890
Of that node?

495
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,030
What's the new
position of the node,

496
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,700
and then we'll look
at the difference

497
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,760
and we'll see the movement
u, the displacement.

498
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:06,820
So how far did it move?

499
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,390
What's the x-coordinate?

500
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,400
How far did it go across?

501
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,470
If I put in that
line you'll know.

502
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,760
So the movement across
was, sin(theta)?

503
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,220
Good. sin(theta).

504
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:28,630
And the movement down, well,
yes, so let's find its position

505
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,550
and then we'll take
the difference.

506
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:41,530
So what's the vertical
new position for that guy?

507
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:47,470
It moved by, it moved
across by sin(theta).

508
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,470


509
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:56,810
And down by 1-cos(theta).

510
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,940
Are you agreed with that?

511
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:04,680
Because here is cosine
theta, right there.

512
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,150
And here's the little
bit it moved down.

513
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,490
OK.

514
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,410
So these are exactly correct.

515
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,550
Yeah this is in the position
of sin(theta), cos(theta),

516
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,540
and the difference
was the 1-cos(theta).

517
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,150


518
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,970
OK, so now here
comes the key point.

519
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,590
Approximately, sin(theta)
is approximately,

520
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:31,680
if theta is small and now here
comes the smallness, sin(theta)

521
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,480
is approximately
theta. sin(theta)'s

522
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,840
approximately theta.

523
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,440
And 1-cos(theta) is
approximately what?

524
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:48,180
Now, this is the
important point.

525
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,690
So theta is like the first term.

526
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,450
If I expand, I
mean, the exact term

527
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:59,380
would be theta minus theta
cubed over six, dot dot dot.

528
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,490
But I'm only keeping that term.

529
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:08,740
And 1-cos(theta), now what's
the formula for cos(theta)?

530
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,350
This is like worth,
just should--

531
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:15,070
It's a one, because of
course cos(0) is one,

532
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,570
and then you subtract what?

533
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,420
Theta squared over two.

534
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,710
And so on.

535
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,540
And then plus theta fourth
over 24 or whatever.

536
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,640
OK, so the ones
cancel as we expect.

537
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,580
And I'm getting theta
squared over two.

538
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:40,100
And this, here was theta
to the first power.

539
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,810
Theta cubed was, we didn't care.

540
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,440
And we don't care
about theta squared.

541
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,870
So that's why it's zero.

542
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,050
Because it's a second
order movement.

543
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:57,330
If theta is small, as I'm going
to assume, small displacement,

544
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,690
theta squared would, if
I allowed theta squared

545
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,910
and cos(theta) in here, I'd
have a non-linear problem.

546
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,120
And I don't want that.

547
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,630
And I don't need it.

548
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:14,740
I mean, finite elements,
structures, bridges, whatever.

549
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,300
Your first hope and
expectation and calculation

550
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,030
is small theta, linear problem.

551
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:27,990
So to a linear person
theta squared is zero.

552
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,490
That's why those guys are zero.

553
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:36,890
OK, so that's an
assumption we'll often see,

554
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:41,990
so it kind of was.

555
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:45,750
There are two kinds
of non-linearities

556
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,650
in structures and elasticity.

557
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:54,980
One would be to allow this
geometric non-linearity.

558
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,670
Thetas, large
displacements, theta large

559
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:01,200
enough so that you can't
neglect theta squared.

560
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,330
That's a tough one.

561
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,960
If you allow geometric
non-linearity in,

562
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,320
as finite element
codes have to do.

563
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,660
If you-- ABAQUS is a code
that does major finite element

564
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,420
calculations, nonlinear ones.

565
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,060
I mean they, at the
beginning they were studying

566
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,410
what happens, what are
the stresses on cables

567
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,800
under the Atlantic.

568
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,910
I mean, those are
fascinating problems.

569
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:29,690
Or I mention car crashes.

570
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,170
I mean, car crashes,
the geometry changes,

571
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,950
you have big displacements.

572
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:38,340
But we're talking here about
linear small displacement

573
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,060
cases.

574
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,200
OK, so don't forget that part.

575
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,120
That when the truss
gets more complicated,

576
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,090
the principle stays the same.

577
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:55,070
That we distinguish between
the thetas that matter

578
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,220
and the theta
squareds that don't.

579
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,220
OK, so now what?

580
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,960
Now I guess I'm
ready to complete

581
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,661
this picture a little more.

582
00:35:06,661 --> 00:35:07,160
OK.

583
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,740
So let me, so we've understood
what's the idea of a mechanism.

584
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:17,220
Oh, how could I
prevent a mechanism?

585
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,450
In other words, if I
stood on this truss,

586
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:29,410
the slightest bit of wind
would crash it down, right?

587
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:32,150
So that's unstable.

588
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,780
That's an unstable truss.

589
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,310
How could I make it stable?

590
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:43,630
I mean if you were designing
this thing, what would you do?

591
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,790
Add another edge.

592
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,370
You'd stick in another bar.

593
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:49,370
Maybe stick in a bar there.

594
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,650
What would happen now?

595
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,392
Would it now be stable?

596
00:35:53,392 --> 00:35:54,850
You'd have to answer
that question.

597
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,580
You couldn't just put
in bars, whatever.

598
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,120
You want to put bars
that do the job.

599
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,560
OK, now how many bars?

600
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,940
We've now got six bars.

601
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,500
So m is now up to six.

602
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,720
The matrix A is six by six now,
whatever that matrix may be.

603
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,940
We have six bars,
six displacements.

604
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,280
We can hope that we now
have a six by six, well,

605
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,220
we do have a six by six
matrix, whatever it looks like.

606
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,300
And we can hope that
it's not singular.

607
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,180
We can hope it's
invertible, we can hope

608
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,820
that that mechanism is killed.

609
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,040
And you see it is killed.

610
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,410
The six by six, that
truss is now stable.

611
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:42,350
No mechanism there, right?

612
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,780
Again I haven't written
down the matrix,

613
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,920
but I'm really calling for
engineering intuition here.

614
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,630
That this truss is now
stable, and of course I

615
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,120
can make it even more stable
by adding a seventh edge.

616
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,690
A seventh bar.

617
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:03,960
So when it was six I had square
matrices, A transpose and then

618
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,250
C and then A would
have been square.

619
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:12,630
Now I've got seven bars and, so
now I've put in a seventh guy.

620
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,400
m is now up to seven.

621
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:24,010
My matrix a would
now be seven by six.

622
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,150
Mechanism will be
gone because I've

623
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:32,270
now got, what, seven equations.

624
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,990
Same six u's.

625
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:39,350
So we begin to get a feel of,
are there solutions or not?

626
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:44,750
What I'm saying is, I can't
tell just from the count

627
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,730
that A is not singular.

628
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:51,880
I could have a lot of bars
and still be unstable.

629
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,300
Invent a truss for me.

630
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:58,450
Just because, how could you
invent a truss that had, maybe

631
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,850
it has seven bars.

632
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:05,000
With those seven bars, those
diagonal guys, that did it.

633
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,870
That made it stable.

634
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:10,640
Our eye tells us that before
we do any linear algebra.

635
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,330
Tell me a seven by-- A thing.

636
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,460
Well, yeah.

637
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:23,300
OK, so here would be, shall
we support both of these?

638
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,860
I'll start out the same, OK.

639
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:32,950
Now, yeah, how could I, let's
see, I've haven't prepared.

640
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:36,230
How could I get a
whole lot of bars.

641
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,340
I might not get seven by
six exactly, but how could

642
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:44,610
I have plenty of bars
and still unstable?

643
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:48,000
Well, suppose I do this.

644
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,640
Oh yeah, that's a good example.

645
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,350
That's not stable, right?

646
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:54,860
OK.

647
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,610
Every let's practice
with that one.

648
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:01,140
That's just my idea,
and problems in the book

649
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,410
just ask you to practice
with things like that.

650
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,070
Tell me the count, first.

651
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,220
What is m, the number of bars?

652
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,260
Six.

653
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,480
What is n, the number
of unknowns, little n,

654
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,560
the number of unknowns?

655
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,200
What's the shape
of my matrix here?

656
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:25,220
A is, it's got six bars
and how many unknowns?

657
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,650
Eight.

658
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,700
Eight, right?

659
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,580
Two here, two, two, two.

660
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,650
None here.

661
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,310
Six by eight.

662
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,010
OK.

663
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:38,900
And how many mechanisms
am I now expecting?

664
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,200
Probably two.

665
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,850
Probably two, there would be
two independent mechanisms here.

666
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,350
Can you tell me
what they look like?

667
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,790
Draw them.

668
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,600
What would they look like?

669
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,430
What would be two different
things that could happen,

670
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:58,870
could go wrong with that truss?

671
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,210
You see it, right?

672
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,400
This could turn.

673
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,100
As in our example with the
top part moving with it.

674
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:13,190
Or, a second one possibility
would be the top part goes.

675
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,260
And the bottom part stays.

676
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,620
Or any combination.

677
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,540
So the whole thing
could go like that.

678
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,540
That would be one.

679
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,230
But that wouldn't be
the only one, of course.

680
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,020
So in other words, we have
a two-dimensional space

681
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,690
of mechanisms and you could
give me two different,

682
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:35,590
and there are not just two
guys, all their combinations

683
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,250
are there.

684
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:40,436
So this would have
two mechanisms.

685
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:41,060
Two mechanisms.

686
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:45,040
And I could put in
bars, of course,

687
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,940
that would try to save it.

688
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,870
Well, how many bars, what's
the minimum number of bars

689
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:54,910
I absolutely need to make
this thing stable again?

690
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,990
Two.

691
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:00,790
Well, now suppose I
put in these two bars.

692
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,480
Right?

693
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,540
I've got enough bars, I've
got an eight by eight matrix,

694
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,250
but I haven't saved it.

695
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,340
Right?

696
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,700
Because it still
has that mechanism.

697
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:14,980
So you can't assume that
because the count is right

698
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,980
you've avoided mechanisms
because in that example you

699
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,990
haven't.

700
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:23,740
OK, so that would be a case
of square eight by eight,

701
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:29,740
but not good.

702
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,280
So as soon as I say
there's a solution to Au=0,

703
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,270
I know that A transpose
A will be singular.

704
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,020
And unstable.

705
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:44,420
OK, before I go to the framework
let's just do one more thing.

706
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:51,680
Suppose I take
away the supports.

707
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,360
All right, let me put
in some bars, though.

708
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,200
I'll put in some bars.

709
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,640
OK, plenty of bars.

710
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,840
Want another one?

711
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,960
OK, how many bars have I got?

712
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,720
Lots, right?

713
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,490
OK, now the matrix A, what
do you think about this?

714
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,084
Are there solutions?

715
00:42:16,084 --> 00:42:18,000
You haven't even seen
the matrix A, of course,

716
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,280
but you've seen the truss,
that's what matters.

717
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,190
How many solutions, are
there solutions to Au=0?

718
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:31,090
Are there ways that this truss
could move without stretching?

719
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,010
Are there ways that this truss
could move without stretching?

720
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,300
And what are they, and
how many are there?

721
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,800
And what name should we use?

722
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,640
OK, what are they?

723
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,410
How could that move
without stretching?

724
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,570
Well, it's got no
supports at all.

725
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,660
It's just free out
there in space.

726
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,540
So it could move.

727
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,290
How many ways could it move?

728
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,220
Three.

729
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,980
It could move, everybody
could move this way.

730
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,710
All ones on the horizontal guys.

731
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,990
Everybody could move
this way, all six

732
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:08,660
ones on the vertical guys,
it'll be 12 unknowns here.

733
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,690
And it could also rotate,
what would be the rotation?

734
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,490
I'm not talking
about this rotation.

735
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,810
This could not happen.

736
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:17,970
What could happen?

737
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,720
What rotation could happen here?

738
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,020
For this, there's a
third rigid motion.

739
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:30,300
Translation, translation,
and rotation around,

740
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,090
well take this
one as an example.

741
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:37,450
The whole thing could
swing around this.

742
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:38,830
That would be a motion.

743
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:40,370
Well now you're
going to say well,

744
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,750
why didn't I swing
it around that one?

745
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,200
And of course it could.

746
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,630
But what would be the deal?

747
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:56,240
It would have to be, there
are only three rigid motions,

748
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,030
right, up and around.

749
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,730
So if you give me another
one, like, around this one,

750
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,370
then somehow it had to be
a combination of those.

751
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:07,620
I don't even want to think
what combination it is.

752
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,630
But there are three
rigid motions.

753
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:15,610
So I sort of distinguish
mechanisms, this word

754
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:16,560
mechanism.

755
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,800
So that's where
the truss deforms.

756
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,060
In these-- And rigid motions,
so I'll say plus, possibly.

757
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,610
Plus rigid motions,
and rigid motions

758
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:42,020
would be, you know, it
doesn't deform internally,

759
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,400
the whole thing moves.

760
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,450
And this is of
course what we get

761
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,140
in the case of not
enough supports.

762
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,750
And this is what we get in
the case of not enough bars.

763
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,250
Yeah.

764
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,950
So maybe it's worth
separating those two.

765
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:02,320
In the examples we do, we'll
usually put in enough supports

766
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,470
to kill the rigid motions.

767
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,630
And then the question would
be are there some mechanisms.

768
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:08,490
OK.

769
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:14,890
Now, I have to start
on what this is.

770
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,960
Well it'll be just
a very quick start.

771
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,710
So what I'll do at the
beginning of Friday,

772
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,250
so Friday's the other
lecture on this topic.

773
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,700
And then the homework will
ask you to do some trusses

774
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,490
in this section.

775
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:31,260
It's probably Section
2 point something.

776
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:38,220
2.7, maybe.

777
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,640
What's the matrix C?

778
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,560
Last second question, what's
the matrix C, what size is it?

779
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,070
What size is the matrix C
for our original problem?

780
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:51,360
Or no.

781
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,730
What size is C, is C
involving, if I know

782
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:00,150
these numbers, what size is C?

783
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:02,520
Five by five. m by m, right?

784
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,990
C is the diagonal matrix,
one entry for each bar,

785
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:15,790
C is just C. It has a c_1,
c_2, c_3, and this w=Ce,

786
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,040
it's just Hooke's
Law on each bar.

787
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,160
So, simple.

788
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,140
It gets there in the
middle, just the way that C

789
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:29,300
in the first exam problem
popped in, and other C's.

790
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,080
That gets there in the middle.

791
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,580
But it's very,
extremely, simple.

792
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:38,970
OK, so the real attention
is on A, as usual.

793
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,990
And that will come
Friday morning.
