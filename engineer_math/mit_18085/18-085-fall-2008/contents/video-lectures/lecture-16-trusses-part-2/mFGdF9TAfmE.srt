00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,880
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, so this
is the second, last lecture

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,800
on trusses.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,440
Then we've got a
holiday on Monday.

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,230
And then after that
we'll be into Chapter 3.

13
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:37,030
I thought I'd write down just
in case it's any use to you,

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,060
the four problems that
I intend to include

15
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,100
with the next homework.

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,560
That won't be due for quite
a while, a week from Monday.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,430
So these will be the
problems on trusses

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,570
that come from particular
trusses drawn in the book.

19
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,650
And then there'll be some
problems from the new material,

20
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,510
that we do next week.

21
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:04,480
So trusses and really, there's
two main jobs for today.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,220
One is to identify
this matrix A,

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,080
the strain-displacement matrix
or the stretching matrix.

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,400
How far do the bars stretch?

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,870
Everybody remembers A is
going to come in this step.

26
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,450
If we have displacements,
then, of the nodes like,

27
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:32,320
this would be like a u_1, this
would be a u_1^H and a u_1^V,

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,070
this would be a
u_2^H and a u_2^V,

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:42,070
so there are four movements
of the ends of the truss

30
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:47,060
and of one particular bar, and
then we'll stretch that bar.

31
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,220
And the question, is how much?

32
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:57,470
So that will be one row of
A. So if we follow one bar,

33
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,910
you remember in the
matrix A, there's

34
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,790
going to be a row for every bar.

35
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:09,090
So a row for each, row
of A. For each bar.

36
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,560
And if we track down
one of those rows,

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,310
we'll have the idea.

38
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,570
And then of course
at the end we'd

39
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,860
maybe be constructing A
without, sort of a free-free A.

40
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,090
And then at the end,
any fixed displacements

41
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,350
that will knock out columns
of A. So that's one job.

42
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,835
And then to see,
so the A is going

43
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:39,430
to be a little more messy.

44
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,930
It's because we're
in two dimensions.

45
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,380
So compared to the
network problems, and

46
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,320
and the line of springs,
now we have more happening.

47
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:57,990
We've got more columns
because every node has now two

48
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,590
unknowns.

49
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,140
A horizontal and vertical.

50
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,990
So A is kind of bigger.

51
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:07,410
And therefore A transpose
C A, you might think,

52
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,480
it's going to be hard
to see what's going on.

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,600
But you'll see the
right way to look

54
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,880
at A transpose C A
is a bar at a time.

55
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,700
That's the nice fact
about A transpose C A,

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,330
I might focus on that first.

57
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,820
And then comes the fun part.

58
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,760
I'll draw some more
trusses, that may or may not

59
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,410
have mechanisms.

60
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,510
They may or may not be stable.

61
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,820
And we can try to
identify the mechanisms.

62
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,370
Actually, as before.

63
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,390
We'll do it by
engineering instinct

64
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,320
rather than by solving.

65
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,840
I mean, in principle, we
could always use elimination.

66
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,830
Or ask MATLAB or any
other system to do it,

67
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,030
and look for the
solutions to Au=0.

68
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,860
And decide are the
columns of A independent.

69
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,280
In that case the
truss is stable.

70
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,610
This matrix is
invertible, we know

71
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,690
all the good possibilities.

72
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,140
And then there's the more
interesting possibility,

73
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,850
of having some
solutions to that.

74
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,520
In which case that
matrix will be singular.

75
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,310
There'll be some modes
in our big system

76
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,990
that will cause it to fail.

77
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,040
But it's kind of
fun to find those.

78
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,730
OK, while I've written
A transpose C A,

79
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:43,560
may I remind you about a good
way to do that multiplication.

80
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,310
OK, so imagine I'm
just putting a number.

81
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,420
Here's going to be the
matrix A. So the matrix A

82
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,930
will have a bunch of rows,
row one, row two, so on.

83
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,410
These rows will correspond
to bar one, bar two, and bar

84
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,620
three.

85
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,390
OK.

86
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,750
OK, then we have C, so
that's a square matrix.

87
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,100
That each bar has a spring
constant, so c_1, c_2, c_3,

88
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,210
and then we have A transpose.

89
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,710
And those rows, or
columns of A transpose.

90
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:26,270
So that's the sort of
picture of A transpose C A,

91
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,140
for a three-bar,
three bars only.

92
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,870
But the point is
made right here.

93
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,470
There's a row of
A for every bar.

94
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,210
Right?

95
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,970
Because our matrix A is m by n.

96
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:47,110
If there are m bars, a
row for every bar, and it

97
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,670
tells us how far that
bar is stretched.

98
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,510
And we'll figure out
what its entries are.

99
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,210
That's our main job.

100
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,440
I'm just looking ahead.

101
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,820
Suppose we've got that row.

102
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,320
And that row, and that row.

103
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,790
So a row for every bar.

104
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,960
Now, here I've taken three bars.

105
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,150
Now, how do I multiply
those matrices?

106
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,380
Well, I can do it
different ways.

107
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,800
But here's a cool way to do it.

108
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,400
Just-- The way I want to
point out is column times row.

109
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,750
If you multiply matrices you're
allowed to-- The effective c_1,

110
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,950
c_2, c_3, is going
to be very simple.

111
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,850
So I'm really paying
attention here

112
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,740
to A transpose A. If I want
to multiply A transpose A,

113
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,680
I can do row times column
as usual and get one number.

114
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:46,140
Or I can do column times row
and get a whole little matrix.

115
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,720
And that's the bar one matrix.

116
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,620
It's the element
matrix, and that's

117
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,350
how finite elements
will be assembled,

118
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,710
and that's why I should
keep mentioning this point.

119
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,880
So the way to do
that column times

120
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,170
row thing, and then of course
that c_1 just multiplies

121
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,750
that row, that'll be c_1.

122
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:18,360
Row one, transpose, that's
the column, times row one.

123
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,580
That's what's
coming from bar one.

124
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,150
That column multiplies
the c_1 and that row.

125
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:30,390
You see how nice, that's the
element matrix associated

126
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,720
with the first bar.

127
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,850
And then there'll be a
second column times the c_2,

128
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,050
times the second row.

129
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:43,710
So plus c_2, row two
transpose, row two.

130
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,230
That's a matrix again.

131
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:52,840
Plus c_3, row three
transpose, row three.

132
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,320
I focus on that because you
don't think of this as a way

133
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,980
to multiply matrices, but it's
really a nice thing to notice.

134
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,220
And it's better to
notice it now when

135
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:10,420
we have three bars or something,
than in a big finite element

136
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,210
code.

137
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,020
Yeah.

138
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:18,840
So this is, just if I complete
it, complete this thought,

139
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,490
this I would call
a one bar matrix.

140
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,640
That's the matrix A transpose
A if there's only one bar.

141
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,790
Actually, one of the problems
at the end of this section

142
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,770
is find the element
matrix for one bar.

143
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,810
And I guess it's
about what we're

144
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,970
going to get to when
we do that one bar.

145
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,030
Do you remember
what it was in the,

146
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,480
just to connect
this thought, what

147
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,740
was the little matrix
in the case of networks?

148
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,790
So in the case of
networks, there

149
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,220
was just one unknown
for each, not two.

150
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,920
So for networks, just, I'm
just going to put down the,

151
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,010
and you'll recognize
it immediately.

152
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,480
The little element matrix
was the c for that,

153
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,010
and there was a
[1, -1; -1, 1] what?

154
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:22,280
Do you remember that guy that
was the [-1, 1] from a row?

155
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,680
[-1, 1] from a column?

156
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,590
So this was exactly
c times the [-1, 1]

157
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,800
from the column times the
[-1,  1] from the row.

158
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,000
That's where this simple
little matrix came from.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,290
And you remember
that the, so what's

160
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,870
involved in creating
this big A transpose

161
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:52,020
C A is just create all
these little pieces, which

162
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,042
are like this, but they're
going to be a little bigger.

163
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:56,750
In fact, in a minute
I'm going to ask you

164
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,860
what size they'll be.

165
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,770
Well, they're
really big matrices.

166
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,950
There are a whole lot of zeroes
there that I didn't even put.

167
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,210
Zeroes are there for rows
and columns that aren't

168
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,270
touching this particular edge.

169
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,300
And again, this matrix.

170
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,440
There'll be all
kinds of zeroes in A.

171
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,070
Because a typical
row of A, bar one,

172
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:27,450
is going to have non-zeroes only
for the, yeah what's the size?

173
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,350
How many non-zeroes
in a typical row of A?

174
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,390
Getting the count right first
is like half the battle.

175
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,620
How many non-zeroes
in a typical row of A?

176
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,430
This was the network case
where we had a couple of nodes.

177
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,830
And they were connected.

178
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,730
And we had an
unknown at each end.

179
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,110
So two unknowns were involved.

180
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,590
The little matrix
was two by two.

181
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:58,040
It properly has lots of zeroes
for all the other nodes that

182
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,470
are not involved.

183
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,080
And then that matrix
kind of gets, assembled

184
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,840
is the word I
think usually used.

185
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,190
All these little guys
get assembled, you

186
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:15,330
know, pasted, stamped, I hear
as the verb sometimes now.

187
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,980
Take these little matrices
for this little element.

188
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:27,290
And stamp them into the big A
transpose C A. This is the c_1,

189
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,630
so this gives the
c_1's in the matrix.

190
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,980
And the c_2's and the c_3's.

191
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,830
Alright.

192
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,560
Now, just before we-- I'm
like doing this preliminary,

193
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,740
before I write down
anything, the exact row.

194
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:48,030
What's the size of, for
trusses, how many non-zeroes

195
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,390
in a row of A?

196
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,930
So that's my question.

197
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:58,460
How many non-zeroes in a
typical row, like for that bar,

198
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:05,470
non-zeroes in a row of A?

199
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:12,620
So A is the matrix that tells
us how much, that row of A

200
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,990
is the row that tells us how
much this bar stretched when

201
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:24,010
this moved along by u H
1, and up by you u V 1,

202
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:32,520
and this moved along by
say, u H 2, and up by u V 2.

203
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,010
Well, I've written all those in.

204
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,980
So that you can
tell me this number.

205
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,940
How many?

206
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,280
What's your guess?

207
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,520
When I tell you,
you'll say of course.

208
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,350
How many u's are involved in
the stretching of that bar?

209
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,560
Four.

210
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,700
Four.

211
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,680
Exactly.

212
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,940
Instead of one at each end,
we have two at each end.

213
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,700
So the answer is four.

214
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,970
How many, the answer is four.

215
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,800
And now the only remaining
question is, what are they?

216
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,730
What are those four numbers?

217
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,850
The four non-zeroes in the row?

218
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,320
So let me just answer that.

219
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,130
They are, so here is that row.

220
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:22,770
So we the two non-zeroes
associated with it.

221
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,549
Well, the way I've numbered
these nodes one and two--

222
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:28,090
Since I've numbered
them one and two,

223
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,570
the non-zeroes are going
to come right at the start.

224
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,340
And then a whole
lot, then this is all

225
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,930
going to be zero after that.

226
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,810
Because those will be nodes
three, four, or five, whatever,

227
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,280
that don't involve bar one.

228
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,530
So bar one just connects
node one to node two.

229
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,020
Now, what do you think?

230
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,570
Well, let me put in
the key quantity here.

231
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,460
This bar is at an angle.

232
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,670
It's at an angle theta.

233
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,760
So there's a theta.

234
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,650
Angle theta.

235
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,300
OK.

236
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:10,840
And so that angle is going
to enter these things.

237
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,980
In fact, here's what you get.

238
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,920
You get, I think if I put the
one up there and the two down

239
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,250
there, let's see.

240
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,250
What am I thinking now?

241
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,490
I'm saying if u 1 H
is positive, that's

242
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,330
going to stretch the bar.

243
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,180
That's a positive stretching.

244
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,370
So I'm expecting a
positive u 1 H to give me,

245
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,660
I'm expecting that sort of
to come in with a plus sign.

246
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:42,100
Now suppose the
bar is horizontal.

247
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,790
Suppose the bar is
horizontal, then

248
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,960
how much does the
u 1 H stretch it?

249
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,840
It stretches it by the
whole u 1 H, right?

250
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,170
If the bar was horizontal,
so theta equals zero.

251
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:02,230
I'm just doing these, we got
to sort out this theta angle

252
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,770
stuff.

253
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,270
So here's my thing.

254
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,940
If the bar happens
to be horizontal,

255
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:13,660
then that stretching by
u H 1, will completely

256
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,370
stretch the bar.

257
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,210
If the bar happened
to be-- Yeah yeah.

258
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,210
And of course, this way.

259
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:26,820
So that for a horizontal bar,
I'll just be back to this step.

260
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,990
I'll have a one and a minus
one. u-- Oh yeah, remind me

261
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,160
about that.

262
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,900
Why doesn't u vertical, for
a horizontal bar like this,

263
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:46,400
why does this one
not stretch the bar?

264
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,960
You remember that
from last time,

265
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,810
that was the little bit of
trig that we did when we forced

266
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,300
ourselves to stay linear.

267
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,680
So we dropped the second
order correction, that

268
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,160
would come from going this way.

269
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,690
Right?

270
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,710
I mean you must have
noticed, like walking?

271
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:14,050
Suppose you want to walk from
here to the end of the bar, OK?

272
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,690
Well, if somebody moves
the end of the bar forward,

273
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,520
you have to take
those extra steps.

274
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
The bar really stretches.

275
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,140
But, if somebody moves
the bar this way,

276
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,590
then the extra bit of
length is much less.

277
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:33,860
In fact, it's zero
to first order.

278
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,590
This is like taking
shortcuts when

279
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,410
you walk across the courtyard.

280
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:45,310
So when the angle's
theta, I'm only

281
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,090
expecting a one and a minus one.

282
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,030
On the horizontal.

283
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,260
And zeroes on the vertical.

284
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,970
OK, now I'm ready
to write it in.

285
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,480
I think when the angle's
theta, when the angle's theta,

286
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,500
any theta, that was
when the angle was zero,

287
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,050
I think we get a cos theta.

288
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,390
Doesn't your instinct
say that this

289
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,940
is on the u_1, u horizontal 1.

290
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:17,970
And then the u vertical 1,
tell me what these should be.

291
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,870
And then we'll make,
what do you suppose

292
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,650
is the entry, second non-zero,
the one that corresponds

293
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,020
to a vertical movement.

294
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,970
Here it would be,
for a horizontal bar

295
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,790
when theta is zero, I'm
going to see a zero there.

296
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,590
But if the bar is at
an angle like this,

297
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,280
what am I going to see?

298
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,670
Everybody's going
to get it right?

299
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,510
What do I put in there?

300
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,320
Sine theta.

301
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,330
What else could it be?

302
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,760
Right, OK, sin(theta).

303
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,680
And now what about the next
guy, the other end of the bar?

304
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,790
u H 2 and u V 2, those are
the other two non-zeroes.

305
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,380
What your guess
for u 2 H, u H 2?

306
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:11,820
If I move this forward,
what's the change

307
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,030
in length of the bar?

308
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:20,110
What would your guess
be that goes into there?

309
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,110
Say it again?

310
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,110
-cos(theta).

311
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,550
-cos(theta), right, yeah.

312
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,020
The movement of
the other end, like

313
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,910
if I move this guy a
little bit to this side.

314
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,240
That will shorten the bar.

315
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,340
Forget about that one.

316
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,770
If I move this over,
the bar becomes shorter.

317
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:51,860
And the cosine tells me
the key number there,

318
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,710
how much it becomes shorter.

319
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,660
If the bar was horizontal,
the cos(theta) was one,

320
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,300
it counts a hundred percent.

321
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:05,570
If the bar is vertical,
and I move it horizontally,

322
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,940
it comes zero percent.

323
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,810
Because the linearity says
there was no first order change.

324
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,980
And now tell me the
final non-zero entry.

325
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,280
And I see I didn't leave
much room for all the zeroes.

326
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,580
OK, what's the u 2 V entry?

327
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,910
-sin(theta), of course.

328
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:33,810
And then come all the zeroes,
for whatever other joints

329
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,950
are not involved with bar one.

330
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,750
So let me, maybe to
make this picture best,

331
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,340
I should move that over
to where it belongs.

332
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,160
Now, if I add up along a bar,
add up the four numbers there,

333
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,980
what do I get?

334
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,360
Zero.

335
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,180
You expected that, right?

336
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,260
In fact, if I add just
that and that I get zero.

337
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,090
If I add that and
that I get zero.

338
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,030
Just the way I got zero here.

339
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,000
In the incidence matrices.

340
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,670
The column of all ones is
certainly going to solve Au=0.

341
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,390


342
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:22,300
Unless the supports
remove those, of course.

343
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,230
If the supports
don't allow all ones

344
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,040
because some have
to stay at zero,

345
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,840
then I could have
a stable truss.

346
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,160
OK, that's a typical bar.

347
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,840
A typical row.

348
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,910
That's a typical row.

349
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:43,320
OK, and now maybe while I'm
on the same subject, what

350
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:52,940
is the size, what does
this thing look like now?

351
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,070
This is in A. This
is in the matrix A,

352
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,970
and now I want to
ask you before I even

353
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,340
come back to all this stuff,
what about in A transpose A?

354
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,620
In A transpose A, A transpose
C A, it the whole deal.

355
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:17,210
The element for-- The little
matrix, the element matrix,

356
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,640
can I call it that?

357
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:25,790
Or the one-bar matrix,
call it the one-bar matrix.

358
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:31,200
Will be, is what?

359
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,550
So I want this, it would
be typical-- c_1, row one

360
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:41,030
transpose, row one,
that's the typical guy.

361
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:48,300
And how many non-zeroes in that?

362
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,160
Multiplying a row.

363
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,490
Sorry, multiplying
a column that has

364
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,640
four non-zeroes
times a row that has

365
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,880
four non-zeroes times a
number, which is just fine.

366
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,860
How many non-zeroes are
going to sit in this element

367
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,610
matrix, this one-bar matrix?

368
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,110
16.

369
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:18,180
16 non-zeroes.

370
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:24,590
And they're going to be, I have
cosine, sine, minus cosine,

371
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:30,400
minus sine, multiplying cosine,
sine, minus cosine, minus sine.

372
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,620
And all multiplied by c_1.

373
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,850
So that's the matrix.

374
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:40,550
And you see what it looks
like. c squared, cs, so on.

375
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,470
16 guys.

376
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:50,170
So we have four squared as our
element matrix, where here we

377
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,920
had two squared.

378
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:59,490
And in finite elements,
when you get to elasticity,

379
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:07,250
and you've got triangles,
you've got triangular elements,

380
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,280
then there are three
nodes involved.

381
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,120
So you're up to higher numbers.

382
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,320
But this gives you the idea.

383
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,480
And remember that this four
by four, the way I've done it,

384
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,330
the way I've numbered
it, one, two,

385
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,430
happens to sit up in
the upper left corner.

386
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:29,550
Of A transpose C A. But
can you sort of imagine

387
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,810
how the code would be written?

388
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,570
The code would be
written, take each bar,

389
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,410
and what do I have to
know about the bar?

390
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,540
Just imagine a code
that would do trusses.

391
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,940
Actually, the final
problem that I'm not

392
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,520
assigning in this section says
what would the code be like?

393
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,380
Can we just have a think
about what the code would look

394
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,780
like if we were to write it.

395
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,850
What would the input have to be?

396
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:08,180
For each bar, what
input do I need?

397
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:14,710
For this bar, I need to know--
And for the whole truss.

398
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,190
What do I have to tell,
what's the information that I

399
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,390
need for the whole truss?

400
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,610
I have to know the positions
of all of the joints, right?

401
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,830
So I'd have to know the
coordinates of that, (x, y),

402
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:34,930
the coordinates of this one,
(x_1, y_1) for joint one,

403
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,010
(x_2, y_2).

404
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,130
So I'd have to have a little
list of what would that be?

405
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,420
m by two?

406
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,260
Oh, no.

407
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:44,980
N. N by 2.

408
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:50,070
I have N, what do I have now?

409
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,160
Think of what
information do I have

410
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,680
to report about this truss?

411
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,090
I guess I have N,
capital N, joints.

412
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:02,560
And I need two coordinates,
x, y for each position.

413
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,440
So that's N by 2, this.

414
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,650
OK, and then for every bar,
what do I need to tell it?

415
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,980
What do I need to put in
the code for a typical bar?

416
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:19,550
I certainly have to put
in the c for that bar.

417
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,780
And what else do I need to know?

418
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,980
I need to know which
joints it's connected.

419
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,660
Right?

420
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,360
I have to tell the system
that this bar is between two

421
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,770
and one, one and two.

422
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,970
I have to tell it which pair.

423
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:42,690
So I guess I have a list
of m bars, and for each bar

424
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:48,840
I must tell the system
the two node numbers,

425
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,460
and the c, the stiffness.

426
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,860
The constant for Hooke's Law.

427
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,600
Right, do you see this picture?

428
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,080
Just sort of visualizing,
creating a code here.

429
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,580
And then the code
would do all this,

430
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,800
oh, have I given enough
information to find theta?

431
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,860
Or do I have to
import theta also?

432
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,720
No.

433
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,120
I told you the
positions, so it'll

434
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,090
figure out cos(theta)
theta and sin(theta).

435
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,820
It actually won't
figure out theta,

436
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,670
that's always a
dumb thing to do,

437
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,990
find the actual
angle. cos(theta)

438
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,760
and sin(theta) is the
quantities we want.

439
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,950
So given that position, (x, y),
and this position (x_2, y_2),

440
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,460
it would know cos(theta)
and sin(theta).

441
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,170
And having drawn
his picture allows

442
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,280
me to make once
more the key point

443
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,530
about small displacements.

444
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:49,360
What's the angle of the
bar after it's moved?

445
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,720
After it's displaced?

446
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,180
It was theta before
it was displaced,

447
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,990
and the angle after is theta.

448
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,980
To first order, the
angle doesn't change.

449
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,690
Because these are little
tiny movements of the ends.

450
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,840
I've drawn them much bigger
than they should be drawn.

451
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,870
They're little, tiny
movements of the ends

452
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:18,520
so that the angle is not
significantly changed.

453
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,200
Otherwise we're into
geometric nonlinearity

454
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,600
and that stuff, that makes
the problem much, much harder.

455
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,140
OK, are you seeing
sort of the picture?

456
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:34,660
I guess what I
haven't completely--

457
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,890
I've really depended
more on your intuition

458
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,980
than on a calculation to
say that these are the four

459
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,410
non-zeroes.

460
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,270
What did I ask you to do?

461
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:51,440
I asked you to check that that
was right in the extreme cases,

462
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,570
like if theta is zero,
the bar is horizontal,

463
00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:00,270
then we just have a 1, 0, -1,
0; vertical isn't happening.

464
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:04,350
If the bar is vertical so that
the angle is 90 degrees then

465
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:09,350
we would have a 0, 1, 0,
-1; everything's vertical.

466
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:14,040
And the book draws
a little picture,

467
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:20,620
and computes delta l from
these four small movements.

468
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,100
And takes the leading
term and sure enough it

469
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:30,790
produces that row of the matrix.

470
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,910
Gosh, I talk real fast.

471
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:38,880
But do you think you could
now create the stiffness?

472
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:46,430
If you had a real truss, you
could create the matrix A

473
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,180
for it?

474
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,390
C is simple, it's given to you.

475
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,970
You could create
A transpose C A?

476
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:58,870
You might just want to
write the command as A'

477
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:03,900
* C * A or something.

478
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,280
And let MATLAB do the thinking.

479
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,760
But I wanted to
just see what these,

480
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:18,530
how this four by four piece
appears in this product,

481
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,660
from each bar.

482
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:26,170
The 16 non-zeroes will
appear in different positions

483
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:30,750
and you told the code
what those positions are.

484
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,190
You had to give the code
a local-to-global picture.

485
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,670
This is the local picture.

486
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,370
Watch one bar.

487
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:45,040
Then it has to fit in
this big n by n matrix,

488
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:50,470
and that means you
have to know what

489
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,700
joints was that bar connecting.

490
00:29:52,700 --> 00:30:05,560
So which positions do these
16 non-zeroes assemble into?

491
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,680
That's some time
devoted to a job

492
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,770
that I actually don't
plan to require you to do.

493
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,220
Creating this truss problem.

494
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:23,760
What I think is kind of more
fun and that's, these homework

495
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,050
problems would deal with it,
is part two of the lecture.

496
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,870
Going back to
mechanisms, and now

497
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:42,870
thinking about more
complicated trusses.

498
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:47,140
We now in principle could
find the solutions to Au=0

499
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,010
because we now
have constructed A,

500
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:55,000
and we could get MATLAB to do
the work or Python or whoever.

501
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,660
But can I go to part
two now and draw a truss

502
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,080
and ask you about
the mechanisms?

503
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:10,240
Let's see.

504
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,600
I guess somewhere
in the problem set,

505
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:25,810
but not one of the assigned ones
is-- Start with those six bars.

506
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:33,350
And six joints, so
these are six joints.

507
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:42,400
And OK, as it stands, how
many-- That's a good question.

508
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,100
As it stands, what's the
shape of the matrix A?

509
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,720
How many rows has it got?

510
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,760
So as it stands, so
I'll call it A_0,

511
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,560
for no supports have been added.

512
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,990
A_0, just the full matrix.

513
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,140
Is what shape?

514
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,330
6 by 12.

515
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:06,830
Good.

516
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,260
6 by 12.

517
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,490
Is 6 by 12.

518
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,890
OK, of course it's not stable.

519
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,770
We know that.

520
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,340
We haven't supported anything.

521
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:24,050
So in a typical case,
how many solutions to A,

522
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:28,430
so I'm going to ask you
how many solutions to Au=0?

523
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,470


524
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,730
And what's your guess?

525
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,570
Six.

526
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:42,170
Got six equations,
we've got 12 u's, 12-6,

527
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,990
so this is going to be 12-6.

528
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:49,560
And of course six
solutions to that equation.

529
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,300
It's what I would expect.

530
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,510
There could be, it
could be possible

531
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:59,400
that the six equations
are not independent.

532
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,740
If they really dropped
to five then this

533
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,710
would bump up to seven, I don't
think it's going to happen.

534
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,930
Now, can you describe those
six solutions, not with

535
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:13,980
numbers, just with, tell me.

536
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,640
I hope you can, because
I can't right now.

537
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,560
OK, three of them we know.

538
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:31,130
So with no supports at all,
what are three rigid motions?

539
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,470
And what are they?

540
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:38,190
The whole truss could move to
the right, the whole hexagon.

541
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,780
It could all move up, it could
all rotate about one point.

542
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:47,090
All three of those would
be movements, displacements

543
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,930
that don't stretch anything.

544
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,150
OK, three rigid motions.

545
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:59,200
Across, up, and rotate.

546
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,110
OK, and I can get rid of those
by supporting some nodes.

547
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:07,690
But let me see, I don't
know what's going to happen.

548
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:14,290
When I describe this topic
as the fun one in 18.085,

549
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,420
it's more fun for
you than for me.

550
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,580
Because I draw something like
that and I start worrying can

551
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,010
I think of three-- How many
mechanisms to look for?

552
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:26,930
Three.

553
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:31,570
That's a big number.

554
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:36,490
I bet you I can find one but
you guys have got to, alright,

555
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,700
tell me some mechanisms.

556
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,290
Let me try to draw them.

557
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:44,970
What would be one mechanism?

558
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,230
Collapses, yeah, somehow.

559
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,720
How shall I make it collapse?

560
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,980
Can squeeze in, yeah,
maybe that's the first one.

561
00:34:53,980 --> 00:35:05,320
This guy comes in, this
guy, what does that do?

562
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,490
I've got 15 minutes here, I
could pull that board down

563
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,560
and draw another one.

564
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,080
What is this one here?

565
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,780
Let's see, if that comes in, do
these guys have to go up a bit?

566
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,550
Yeah, because that
angle's not 90 degrees.

567
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:24,680
So we've got a first
order change in this.

568
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,000
So this comes in a little,
this goes up a little,

569
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,480
this guy maybe stays straight.

570
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,160
Would you go for this,
I mean, please say yes?

571
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,990
Something happens there, right?

572
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:50,430
These things go in
and those go out.

573
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,330
Could you create
the-- I mean if this

574
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:57,930
was a equal-side,
regular hexagon,

575
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:03,000
you could put in all
the numbers for all 12,

576
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,440
I would be looking
for 12 numbers.

577
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,870
Six joints and they
each have two u's,

578
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:15,180
so that wouldn't be so
simple but you could do it.

579
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:20,600
So that would be one.

580
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,220
Looking for number two.

581
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,820
What would be another one?

582
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:32,460
So sort of squeezing
in like whatever.

583
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,360
What do you think?

584
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,080
Any others?

585
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,580
Maybe that's possible.

586
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:49,690
Maybe I just look at it,
you think that would work?

587
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,350
We could hope those
were independent,

588
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:54,390
but I wouldn't
put my life on it.

589
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:59,696
I have this squeeze in, this
squeeze in and this squeeze in,

590
00:36:59,696 --> 00:37:03,170
I would worry a little bit.

591
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,860
I can see another one.

592
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,350
AUDIENCE: Half, for--

593
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,780
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Fold it in half.

594
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:16,679
AUDIENCE: Along, I guess that
sort of gets into 3-D, but.

595
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,970
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah, we've
got to stay in the plane,

596
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:24,220
right.

597
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,790
I have instead of what?

598
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,400
OK.

599
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

600
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,440
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Squeeze that out.

601
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,420
Yeah.

602
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,170
Good.

603
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,530
Number two.

604
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:47,210
And then I can see, here's one,
here's an easy one to think of.

605
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:51,420
Leave these three alone
and just rotate these guys.

606
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,950
Bring this down, right?

607
00:37:54,950 --> 00:38:03,880
Just bring these three
vertically down, or something.

608
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:11,890
You see why it's sort of, did
you like that one alright?

609
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,440
It seems simple to me, looking
at it, just leave these guys--

610
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,060
Rotation, let this turn down.

611
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,490
This turn down, let's
say, and this go down.

612
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:27,640
Maybe these would all
drop by the same amount.

613
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:33,310
Maybe.

614
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:38,650
So anyway, whatever.

615
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,480
Let's put some supports on them.

616
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,290
And get these numbers down.

617
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:50,400
So let's support, as
usual, the bottom guy.

618
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,190
OK, so different problem now.

619
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:58,970
I won't call that A_0, I'll
call it A. I'll ask myself,

620
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,620
is it stable or unstable?

621
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:06,400
The matrix is now six by what?

622
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,570
Eight, because
I've taken away, I

623
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:14,290
have four reaction forces,
two at each support,

624
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,930
horizontal and vertical.

625
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:20,170
I've got four free nodes.

626
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,200
And six by eight.

627
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,440
Let me put in-- So six by
eight, what am I expecting now?

628
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,830
Any rigid motions?

629
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,770
No, no rigid motions now.

630
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,360
How many solutions
am I expecting?

631
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,380
Two, I think.

632
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,350
Probably two.

633
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,760
How many mechanisms?

634
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,790
Well, no rigid motions.

635
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,060
So probably two mechanisms.

636
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,400
Now, can we find two mechanisms?

637
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,840
Alright, this is
like more reasonable.

638
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,430
We can see whether whether
we get two mechanisms

639
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,370
and whether they're
really different.

640
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,870
OK, what are the mechanisms now?

641
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,830
These guys are fixed.

642
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:13,180
So forget my little sketch
here, and think again.

643
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,910
What do you see?

644
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,140
Alright, let's
have one mechanism.

645
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:23,380
What would one mechanism be now?

646
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,720
There have to be two.

647
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,240
What do you think?

648
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,950
Sit on it.

649
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,680
Alright, bring these guys
down, and then these guys

650
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,730
will go out, is that it?

651
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:43,340
OK, so a number, mechanism
number one, sit on truss.

652
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,080
OK.

653
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,680
Alright.

654
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,890
Now, I don't know
what number two

655
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,850
is, that's why I'm taking time.

656
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:56,162
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

657
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,120
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

658
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,450
Or could we do this, could we
bring these guys in and let's

659
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,260
go up?

660
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,720
It's the same thing.

661
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:10,220
OK, so squeeze truss.

662
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,370
Squeeze sides.

663
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,260
Is that the same
thing that I had,

664
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,610
number one the same as two.

665
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,390
Oh jeez, OK.

666
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:24,590
Is that what-- Everybody
is agreeing with this?

667
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,090
OK.

668
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,521
So I didn't get, my
number two was no good.

669
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:29,020
OK.

670
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,250
What's a better number two?

671
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,490
Hold an edge?

672
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,440
Like that one.

673
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,690
I'm just doing what
you say, I'm not.

674
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:47,300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Just
this guy, rotates like so.

675
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,710
And this guy will
rotate, and this guy.

676
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:56,020
That looks pretty good to me.

677
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,510
Good, is that correct?

678
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,110
Say that one again?

679
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,550
So the first one was
when these two came down

680
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,730
and these went out.

681
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,600
Right, OK.

682
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,650
And now your suggestion
is, you picked on this guy

683
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,570
and held it fixed.

684
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,370
And then this one came
down a little bit.

685
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,820
It'll, of course,
how will it move?

686
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,190
It will move
perpendicular, right?

687
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,690
Small movement.

688
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,460
The bar is not going
to change length,

689
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,830
that's the whole point, right?

690
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,670
The bar is not changing length.

691
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:32,550
So the movement must be, it
must be a simple rotation.

692
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,860
Around here.

693
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,420
OK.

694
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,340
Right, and of course
again you might say well,

695
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:42,500
the bar really did change
length because that's not

696
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,510
quite the same as that.

697
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,890
But then again that's
my second order basis.

698
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,300
So that one came down,
and what did this one do?

699
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,740
Came down the same.

700
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:58,530
OK, and this one it also moves.

701
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:03,770
What is that?

702
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:07,800
OK, so what am I going
to call this one?

703
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,670
Fix one.

704
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,170
Yeah.

705
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,520
Fix one node.

706
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,530
And that makes sense.

707
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,720
Fix one joint, yeah.

708
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,420
And then, and rotate the rest.

709
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,210
I think that would be possible.

710
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,460
Yep.

711
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:29,960
OK, a small prize
for anybody who,

712
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:37,430
maybe handwritten, a picture
of two really nice mechanisms.

713
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:40,870
Somehow this one seems
a little un-symmetric

714
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:43,340
in a problem that's
so symmetric,

715
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,820
so I would guess that
somewhere along the line

716
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:50,850
we could find a kind of
more some symmetric one.

717
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:55,890
But I don't see what
it is right now.

718
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:03,520
Can the whole thing
rotate a little?

719
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,890
Could that rotate, could
the whole thing rotate?

720
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,510
Yeah, maybe it could.

721
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:15,540
This guy would go up,
maybe that's possible.

722
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:20,370
That's somehow got
everybody into the action.

723
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:23,310
So I'll put "or rotate".

724
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:27,440
OK, so you see what
questions you get into.

725
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,630
May I just draw a
different truss?

726
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:38,930
So those homework questions
are other trusses.

727
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:46,090
Here's one that I drew
in the book itself.

728
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:52,290
Yeah, may I draw this,
I called it a treehouse.

729
00:44:52,290 --> 00:45:01,210
OK, so I have, so here's one
that's actually in the book.

730
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:07,680
And it's got a couple of
bars going up, and one over.

731
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,850
So that's the start.

732
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:14,170
Then it's got a
diagonal and that one.

733
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,530
And then here comes
the treehouse.

734
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:23,000
OK, right.

735
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,190
Well, just to get, let's
again get the count right.

736
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:34,220
So what's the matrix
A for this treehouse?

737
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,920
A is how many by how many?

738
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,770
How many bars are
you seeing here?

739
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:46,820
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, eight bars.

740
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:51,720
And how many unknown
displacements?

741
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,530
Ten.

742
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,550
We got five joints
that are not supported,

743
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:59,010
and each one has two unknowns.

744
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,770
So A is eight by ten.

745
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:06,130
So I expect two mechanisms.

746
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:15,300
OK, so again I'm looking
for two mechanisms.

747
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,245
OK, what's one?

748
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:20,120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

749
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,970
PROFESSOR STRANG: It's what?

750
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:29,400
This guy just falls, right.

751
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,450
This looks unfortunately
very much like the treehouses

752
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:36,630
that I built for my kids.

753
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:44,540
Well, so linear algebra
sentenced them to fall, right?

754
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,370
OK, that's one.

755
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,830
I probably propped
it up with one more

756
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,340
bar, but of course that
wouldn't be enough,

757
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:56,690
because it's got two mechanisms,
so if I make it nine by ten

758
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,530
I haven't saved the kids.

759
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:06,780
OK, with eight by ten,
what's the other mechanisms?

760
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,770
The whole thing could
turn the-- Nothing

761
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,320
preventing turning here.

762
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,340
They can't move but
they could turn.

763
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:19,760
So the whole thing could go
over, right, the whole thing

764
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,720
could just-- That would be a
horizontal movement of all five

765
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,220
nodes.

766
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,730
The horizontal of
all five nodes.

767
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:31,970
And again, slightly downwards,
but that's a second order

768
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:34,220
effect.

769
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:38,930
OK, so that's the second truss.

770
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,140
OK.

771
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:47,250
So this is really like
practice for discrete problems,

772
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:50,310
for the problems of
plane elasticity.

773
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:57,860
And the point is that there are
two unknowns for each point.

774
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,347
If we have
differential equations.

775
00:47:59,347 --> 00:48:00,930
So the differential
equations of plane

776
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:04,190
elasticity are
not really simple.

777
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,790
They're not really simple.

778
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:08,620
And 3-D elasticity even more.

779
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:15,100
Because the points
are physical points

780
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:22,140
and they can move three ways,
and it gets quite interesting.

781
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:28,130
And those are the major problems
of computational mechanics.

782
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:34,540
OK, let's say, holiday time,
and I'll see you next Wednesday

783
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,820
for Chapter 3.

784
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,953
Which moves to partial
differential equations.

785
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:40,453
