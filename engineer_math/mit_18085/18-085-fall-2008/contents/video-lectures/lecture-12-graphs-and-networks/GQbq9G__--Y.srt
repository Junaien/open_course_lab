00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,430
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK,
so this is the start --

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,780
I won't be able to do
it all in one day --

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:34,380
of what I think of as the number
one model in applied math,

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,540
in discrete implied
math, I'll say.

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,430
Let me review what
our four examples are.

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,700
Just so you see the big picture.

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,290
So the first example was
the springs and masses.

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,360
That was beautiful.

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,750
It's simple.

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,850
The masses are all in a
line, and the matrix K,

19
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,840
the free-fixed and
fixed-fixed and free-free

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,480
come out closely related
to our K, T, B matrices.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,120
So that was the
natural place to start,

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,290
and actually we
also got a chance

23
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,390
to do the most important
equation in time.

24
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,750
Ku''-- Sorry, Mu''+Ku=0.

25
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,330
So that was a key example.

26
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,740
Then least squares.

27
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,930
Very important, I'm
already getting questions

28
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,430
from the class about problems
that come up in your work,

29
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,120
least square problems.

30
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:46,840
Maybe I'll just mention that
the professional numerical guys

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,050
don't always go
to A transpose A.

32
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,740
If it's a badly
conditioned problem,

33
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,470
and that conditioning is
a topic that was in 1.7

34
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,860
and we'll eventually
come back to, if it's

35
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,190
a badly conditioned problem,
matrix A then-- A transpose

36
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,090
A kind of makes it worse.

37
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,844
So there's another way to
orthogonalize in advance.

38
00:02:08,844 --> 00:02:10,760
And if you're working
with orthogonal vectors,

39
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,870
or orthonormal vectors,
numerical calculations

40
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,090
are as safe as they can be.

41
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,520
Yeah.

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,080
Wall Street is more
like A transpose A.

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,930
And the orthonormal
is the safe way.

44
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,270
Alright, this is
today's lecture.

45
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,870
You'll see the matrix a
for a graph, for a network.

46
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:46,310
It's simple to construct, and
it just shows up everywhere.

47
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,930
Because networks are everywhere.

48
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,720
And, just, looking
ahead, trusses

49
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,250
are there partly because
they're the most fun.

50
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,790
You'll enjoy trusses.

51
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,520
I mean, it's kind
of fun to figure out

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,920
is the truss going
to collapse or not.

53
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,450
It's good.

54
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,450
And actually, what's the
linear algebra in there?

55
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:15,740
The collapsing or not will
depend on solutions to Au=0.

56
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:21,220
Let me just recall
the equation Au=0.

57
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,310
If A is our key matrix
in each example,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,700
it's different in each example.

59
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:34,050
And we sort of hope that
Au=0 doesn't have solutions,

60
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,780
or that it has
solutions we know.

61
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,270
Because if Au=0 has solutions
that's the case where A

62
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:48,170
transpose A is not invertible
and we have to do something.

63
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,630
Very useful to review.

64
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:56,280
What were the solutions to
Au=0, in the case of springs?

65
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,070
Well, there were some
in the free-free case.

66
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,130
The all ones vector
was the solution u,

67
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,740
or all constant
was the solution u

68
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,040
in the free-free case and that's
why we couldn't invert it.

69
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,230
But the fixed-free
or the fixed-fixed,

70
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,410
when we have one
support or two supports,

71
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,640
that removed the
all ones solution.

72
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,020
Good.

73
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,680
Least squares, we assume
there weren't any.

74
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,740
We assumed-- Because we
wanted to work directly

75
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,690
with A transpose A,
the normal equations,

76
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,910
so we assumed that the
columns of A were independent.

77
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,010
We assumed that there were no
non-zero solutions to Au=0.

78
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,600
Because if there
were, that would

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,920
have made A
transpose A singular,

80
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,650
and we would have had to
do something different.

81
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,100
Here, this'll be a
lot like this one.

82
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:59,370
Today, once you see A, you'll
spot the solutions to Au=0.

83
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,530
This is A for a network.

84
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,770
And the solution is going to
be that same guy, all ones.

85
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,840
And that only tells us again
that we have to ground a node,

86
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,350
I may use an electrical term.

87
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,710
Grounding a node is like
fixing a displacement.

88
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,420
Once you've fixed one
of those, say at zero,

89
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,430
whatever, but zero's
the natural choice.

90
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,040
Once you've said one of the
potentials, one of the voltages

91
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,670
is zero, then you
know all the rest.

92
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,700
You can find all the
rest from our equations.

93
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,650
So this is like this in
having this all ones solution.

94
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,980
And as you'll see
with trusses, that

95
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,500
could, depending on the
truss, have more solutions.

96
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,340
And if there are
more solutions that's

97
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,170
when the truss collapses.

98
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,670
So the trusses need more
than just a single support

99
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,800
to hold up a whole truss.

100
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,590
OK.

101
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,330
So that's the Au=0.

102
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,220
Now we're ready for
the lecture itself.

103
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,290
Graphs and networks.

104
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,850
OK, let me start
with, what's a graph.

105
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:18,190
A graph is a bunch
of nodes and some

106
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,390
or all of the
edges between them.

107
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,840
Let me take just a particular
example of a graph.

108
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,570
And this of course
you spot in the book.

109
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,070
Oh and everybody
recognized that,

110
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,050
and it's probably now corrected,
that in the homework where

111
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,560
it said 3.4 it meant
2.4, of course.

112
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,080
And this is Section 2.4 now.

113
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,920
Let me draw a different graph.

114
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,080
Maybe it'll have four
nodes, at those four edges,

115
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,300
let me put in a fifth edge.

116
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,000
OK, that's a graph.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,970
It's not a complete
graph because I

118
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,930
didn't include that extra edge.

119
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,100
It's not a tree because
there are some loops here.

120
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,750
So complete graphs
are one extreme where

121
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,350
all the edges are in.

122
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,860
A tree is the other
extreme, where you

123
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,610
have a minimum number of edges.

124
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,560
It would only take
probably three edges.

125
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,860
So just while we're
looking at it,

126
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,490
there are a bunch
of possible trees

127
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,540
that would be sort
of inside this graph.

128
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,220
Sub-graphs of this graph, if
I knock out those two edges

129
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,670
I have a tree, going out.

130
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,120
Or a tree could be like this.

131
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,720
Or a tree could be like this.

132
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,830
Anyway, five edges is in this
graph, six in a complete graph,

133
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,640
it would be three
edges in a tree.

134
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,270
OK, and the number
of edges is always m.

135
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:59,040
So five edges.

136
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,160
And the number of nodes
is always n, for nodes.

137
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,720
So A will be five by four.

138
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,030
OK.

139
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:15,020
And it's called, so we get a
special name in this world,

140
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,490
it's called the incidence
matrix of the graph.

141
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,820
The incidence matrix.

142
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,290
Or, of course,
these things come up

143
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,380
so often they have
other names, too.

144
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:32,120
But incidence matrix is
a pretty general name.

145
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,960
OK, I have to number
the nodes just

146
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,610
so we can create the matrix
A. One, two, three, four.

147
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,180
And I have to number the edges.

148
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,860
If I don't number them, I
don't know which is which.

149
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,250
So let me call this edge
one, from one to two,

150
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,320
and I'll draw an
arrow on the edges.

151
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,890
So from one to
two, maybe this'll

152
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,020
be edge two, from one to three.

153
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,590
This'll be edge three.

154
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,670
Oh no, let me put edge three
there, would be a natural one,

155
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,640
say from two to three.

156
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,330
And how about edge four
there, from two to four.

157
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,070
And edge five going
from three to four.

158
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:18,450
OK, so now I have numbered,
I've identified the nodes,

159
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,640
and I've identified the edges.

160
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,390
And there were five
edges and four nodes.

161
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,590
Usually m is bigger than n.

162
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,590
We're in this--
Except for trees,

163
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:34,720
m will be at least
as large as n.

164
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,630
And I've put arrows
on, so you could

165
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,370
say it's a directed graph.

166
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,280
Because I've given a direction.

167
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,020
You'll see that the directions,
those arrow directions, which

168
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:51,180
are just to tell me which way
current should count as plus,

169
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,490
if it's with the arrow, or which
way it should count as minus

170
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,970
if it's against the arrow.

171
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,600
Of course, current
could go either way.

172
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,970
It's just, now I have a
convention of which is plus

173
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,230
and which is minus.

174
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,745
OK, so now let me tell
you the incidence matrix.

175
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:10,700
So everybody can
get it right away,

176
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,950
how do you create
this incidence matrix?

177
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,270
A five by four.

178
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,710
So it's going to have five
rows, one for every edge.

179
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,670
So what's the row for edge one?

180
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,320
And it's got four columns,
one for every node.

181
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,710
So these are the nodes.

182
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,370
Nodes one, two, three, four.

183
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,750
So there's a column for every
node and a row for every edge.

184
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,900
OK, edge one.

185
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,720
This is just going to tell me
everything about the graph.

186
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,330
So exactly what's in that
picture will be in this matrix.

187
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,650
If I've erased one,
I could reproduce it

188
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,170
by knowing the other one.

189
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,350
OK, edge one goes from
node one to node two.

190
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,270
So it leaves node one,
I'll put a minus one there.

191
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,530
In the first column.

192
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:05,660
And a plus one in
the second column.

193
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,680
Edge one doesn't touch
nodes three and four.

194
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,670
So there you go,
that's edge one.

195
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,690
Let me do edge two
and then you'll

196
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,080
be able to fill in the rest.

197
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,850
So edge two goes from one to
three, minus one, and a one.

198
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:27,170
Edge three goes from two to
three, I'll just keep going.

199
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,980
Minus one and a one.

200
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:35,660
Edge four goes from two to four.

201
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:43,370
And edge five goes
from three to four.

202
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,910
OK.

203
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,060
Simple, right?

204
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,910
Got it.

205
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,510
That matrix has got all
the information that's

206
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:56,700
in my picture, and the matrix--
But the point about matrices

207
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,360
is, they do something.

208
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,740
They multiply a vector
u to produce something.

209
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,890
They have a meaning beyond
just a record of the picture.

210
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,460
So A is a great thing.

211
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,300
In fact, what does it do?

212
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,430
Let's see.

213
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,050
So that's the matrix
A that we work with.

214
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,930
Oh, first tell me about Au=0.

215
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,500
Because we brought up
that subject already.

216
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,460
Are those four
columns independent?

217
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,010
I've got four columns,
they're sitting

218
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,540
in five-dimensional space,
there's plenty of room

219
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,100
there for four
independent vectors.

220
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,530
Are these four columns
independent vectors?

221
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,400
No.

222
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,420
No, they're not.

223
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,780
Because what combination
of them produces the zero

224
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,100
vector? [1, 1, 1, 1].

225
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,010
If I take that column plus
that, plus that, plus that,

226
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:54,160
I'm multiplying by-- So, A,
I'll just put that up here

227
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,920
and then I won't have
to write it again.

228
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:05,430
A times [1, 1, 1, 1],
is five zeroes.

229
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,670
So that u, that
particular u, of all ones,

230
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:17,260
is, I would say, in the
null space of the matrix.

231
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,970
The null space is all
the solutions at Au=0.

232
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,830
In other words, so
these four columns,

233
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,690
tell me about the
geometry again.

234
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,300
These four columns, if I take
all their combinations, yeah.

235
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,320
Think about this.

236
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,020
If I take all four
combinations, all combinations,

237
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,910
any amount of this
column, this column,

238
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,780
this column, that
fourth column, those

239
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,430
are all vectors in
five-dimensional space.

240
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,270
Now, this isn't
essential but it's good.

241
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,770
Do you have an idea
of what you'd get?

242
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,140
What would you get if you took,
so this, think of four vectors,

243
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,890
pointing along, take
all their combinations,

244
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,180
that kind of fills in.

245
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,540
Whatever fill in may mean.

246
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,030
And what does it fill in?

247
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,320
What do I get?

248
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,620
What's your image?

249
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,700
Frankly, I don't know.

250
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,990
I can't visualize
five-dimensional space.

251
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,840
That well.

252
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,060
But still, we can use words.

253
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,290
What do you think?

254
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,480
You get a something subspace.

255
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,180
You got a something,
you get something flat.

256
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,110
I don't know if you do.

257
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,520
It's pretty flat, somehow.

258
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,200
Like I'm just asking you to
jump up from a case we know.

259
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,780
Where we had columns in
three-dimensional space

260
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,830
and we took a combination
and they gave us a plane.

261
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,830
Right, when they were dependent?

262
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,970
Now, how would you
visualize the combinations

263
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,250
in five-dimensional space?

264
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,780
Just for the heck of it?

265
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,250
It's some kind of a
subspace, I would say.

266
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,600
And what's its dimension, maybe
that's what I want to ask you.

267
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,640
What's the dimension?

268
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,770
Do I get, like, a
four-dimensional subspace

269
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,950
of five-dimensional space
when I take the combinations

270
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,800
of these particular four guys?

271
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,680
Yes or no?

272
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,880
Do I get a
four-dimensional subspace,

273
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,730
whatever that may mean?

274
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,870
No.

275
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,680
Right answer, I don't.

276
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,210
I don't.

277
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,900
Somehow the dimension of that
subspace, whatever I get,

278
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,990
isn't four because
this fourth guy is not

279
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,060
contributing anything new.

280
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,270
The fourth one is a
combination of the first three.

281
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,620
So I get a
three-dimensional subspace.

282
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,340
The rank of this
matrix is three.

283
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,960
If you allow me to
introduce that key word,

284
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:52,360
rank is the number of
independent columns.

285
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,240
It tells you how big
the matrix really is.

286
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,140
You know, if the
matrix, if I pile

287
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:05,290
on a whole lot of zero
columns, or a lot of zero rows,

288
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,490
the matrix looks bigger.

289
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,050
But of course it
isn't truly bigger.

290
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,930
The heart of the matrix,
the core of the matrix

291
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,170
is somehow just three.

292
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,690
And actually, I tell you
now and we'll see it happen,

293
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,090
can I tell you the key
result in the first half

294
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,960
of linear algebra?

295
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,160
It's this.

296
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,100
That if I have three independent
columns, and by the way

297
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,170
any three are independent,
it's just all four

298
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,790
together are dependent.

299
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,690
This has three
independent columns,

300
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,090
then the great fact is, it
has three independent rows.

301
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,880
That's kind of fantastic.

302
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,040
Since it's such a beautiful
and remarkable and basic fact,

303
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,100
look at the rows.

304
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,070
That what linear
algebra is all about.

305
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,920
Looking at a matrix by
columns, and then by rows,

306
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,090
and seeing what are
the connections.

307
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,770
And the connection
is, the key connection

308
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:09,750
is, that these five rows,
now what space are they in?

309
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,840
What what space
are these rows in?

310
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,300
Four-dimensional space.

311
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,280
They only have four components.

312
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:24,220
So I had four columns in
5-D, I have five rows in 4-D.

313
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,720
But now, are those
five rows independent?

314
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,780
Let me just ask that question.

315
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,060
Are those five
independent rows, are

316
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,370
they pointing in
different directions,

317
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,690
or could any combination
give the zero vector in 4-D,

318
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,950
looking at those five rows?

319
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,500
What do you say, wait a minute.

320
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,760
Five vectors, in
four-dimensional space?

321
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,190
Dependent, of course.

322
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,690
Right.

323
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,870
So they're dependent.

324
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,240
There couldn't be five
independent vectors in 4-D.

325
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,050
But are there four in
this particular case?

326
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,850
And here's the great
fact, no, there are three.

327
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,190
If there are three independent
columns and no more,

328
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,270
then there are three
independent rows and no more.

329
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,200
And we'll get to see which
rows are independent.

330
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,140
And which are not.

331
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,290
That's a question
about A transpose,

332
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,340
and we haven't got
to A transpose yet.

333
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,650
OK, are you OK with
that incidence matrix?

334
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:36,640
Because this is like the
central matrix of our subject.

335
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,310
We can figure out A transpose
A, that's kind of fun.

336
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,860
If I do A transpose
A then you'll

337
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:49,210
see the core computations
of this neat section.

338
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,990
So if I do A transpose A, so I'm
going to bring in A transpose

339
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,570
and you know that I'm not just
bringing it in from nowhere,

340
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,740
that networks--
the balance law is

341
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,890
going to involve A transpose.

342
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,930
So let's just anticipate.

343
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,390
What do you think A
transpose A looks like?

344
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,730
Now, how am I going
to do this for you?

345
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,280
May I write-- May I
erase this for a moment,

346
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,780
and try to squeeze
in A transpose here?

347
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:25,570
So that you can multiply it
by sight and see the answer,

348
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,150
and then you'll see the pattern.

349
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,370
That's the great
thing about math.

350
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,660
You do a few
examples, and you hope

351
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,860
that a pattern reveals itself.

352
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,500
So let me show A transpose.

353
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,950
So now I'm going to take that
column and make it a row.

354
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,530
I'm going to take that
column and make it a row,

355
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,770
it's going to be a little
squeezed but we can do it.

356
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:56,510
Take that column,
[0, 1, 1, 0,  -1].

357
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:01,060
And the last column,
[0, 0, 0,  1, 1].

358
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,300
OK.

359
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,130
So I just wrote
A transpose here.

360
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:10,040
And now could you help
me with A transpose A.

361
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,350
Which is the key matrix
in the graph here.

362
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,040
What size will it be?

363
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,160
Everybody knows it's
going to be square,

364
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,010
it's going to be symmetric,
and just tell me the size.

365
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,940
Four by four.

366
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,170
Right, we have a four by
five times a five by four,

367
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,110
we're expecting this
to be four by four.

368
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,840
And what's the first entry?

369
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,120
Two.

370
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,770
Right, take row one,
dot it with column one.

371
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:44,070
I get two ones and then a bunch
of zeroes, so I just get a two.

372
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,030
What's the next entry?

373
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:50,140
Take row one against column two,
can you do that in your head?

374
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:56,890
Row one, column two, the top one
is going to hit on a minus one,

375
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,790
and I think that's
all there is, right?

376
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,840
Then this one hits a zero
and those three zeroes, so.

377
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,810
And then what about
the next guy here?

378
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,830
A minus one.

379
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,170
And the last guy?

380
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,940
A zero.

381
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,310
So that's row one
of A transpose A.

382
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:24,000
Can I just look at that
for a moment before I fill

383
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,750
in the rest?

384
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:30,490
And then, when you fill in the
rest it'll confirm the idea.

385
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,950
Why do I have a zero there?

386
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:38,040
Why did a zero appear
in the 1, 4 position?

387
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,260
If I look back at
the graph, what

388
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,390
is it about nodes one and four
that told me ahead of time?

389
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:49,060
You're going to get a zero
in that A transpose A.

390
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,580
Everybody see what
nodes one and four are?

391
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,460
Yeah, say it again.

392
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,540
Not connected.

393
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,360
No edge.

394
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,980
Here there was an edge
from node one to two.

395
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,070
Here is an edge from
node one to three.

396
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,330
Those both produce
the minus ones.

397
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:11,300
And on the diagonal came
the two to balance it.

398
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,900
What does that two represent?

399
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,000
That two represents
the number of edges

400
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,600
that do go into node one.

401
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,450
See, that row is
all about node one.

402
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,520
So there are two edges into
it, and then an edge out,

403
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,310
and an edge out, and the
edge out and the no edge.

404
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,410
OK.

405
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,990
So, now I know it's going
to be a symmetric matrix,

406
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,040
so I could speed up
and fill those in.

407
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,590
What's the next entry here?

408
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,670
What's the guy on this diagonal?

409
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,500
So that's row two
against column two,

410
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,770
so I have a one
there, a one there,

411
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,300
a one there, that makes a three.

412
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,510
Why a three?

413
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,970
Because there are,
yeah, you got it.

414
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:04,460
There are three edges
into node number two.

415
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,770
Three edges into
node number two,

416
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,070
and now I'm going to have some
minus ones off the diagonal

417
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,900
for those edges.

418
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,050
So what are these
entries going to be here?

419
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,890
They're both minus ones.

420
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,320
Edge two is connected to
all three other nodes.

421
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,100
So I'm going to see a minus
one and a minus one there,

422
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,530
and it's going to be symmetric.

423
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:32,770
And I'm nearly there.

424
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,860
Of course, I'm
describing a pattern

425
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,040
that you're just
seeing unfold, but I'm

426
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,430
doing it that way so
that you'll feel hey,

427
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,180
I can write down A
transpose A, or check it

428
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:50,620
quite quickly, without
doing this complete matrix

429
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,620
multiplication.

430
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,510
So what number goes there?

431
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,530
That's to do with
node three, and I

432
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,090
see node three connected
to all three other nodes,

433
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,000
and so what do you expect there?

434
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,310
Minus one there, and
a minus one there,

435
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,190
and what do you expect here?

436
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,600
Two.

437
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,500
And so now I have my matrix.

438
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,490
The A transpose A matrix.

439
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,660
And that's square
and it's symmetric.

440
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,150
Now I ask you, is it
positive definite?

441
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,980
Or is it only semi-definite?

442
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,090
Right, we know that A transpose
A is always positive definite

443
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,720
in the best case.

444
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,030
But only positive
semi-definite if it's singular,

445
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,790
if there's some vector
in its null space,

446
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,390
if a transpose a times
some vector gives zero.

447
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,540
If some combination
of those columns

448
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,360
gives me the zero column.

449
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,110
Which is it?

450
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:52,510
Have I got a singular matrix
or an invertible matrix here?

451
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,070
Singular.

452
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,650
Why singular?

453
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,750
Because a had some
solutions to Au=0.

454
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:06,020
So if Au equaled zero, then
I could multiply both sides

455
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,710
by A transpose, that same
u, A transpose times zero

456
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,480
will still be zero, it might
be a different size zero,

457
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,140
but it'll be zero.

458
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,750
And what's the u, then?

459
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,740
It's the all ones vector.

460
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:27,360
What am I saying about the
columns of A transpose A?

461
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,050
They're dependent.

462
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:32,480
They add up-- Because
it's the [1, 1, 1, 1]

463
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,240
vector that's guilty,
every row adds to zero.

464
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,480
Every row adds to zero.

465
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,360
Let me just say for a moment,
introduce two notation

466
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,040
for the diagonal matrix.

467
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,640
D, that's the diagonal matrix,
two, three, three, two.

468
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,220
And then I'll put
in a minus sign,

469
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,780
and this is and I'll
call it W. So you

470
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,270
can pick out what D and W are,
but let me do it for sure.

471
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,880
So D, the degree matrix.

472
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,750
See, this is this is like fun
because I'm not doing anything

473
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,250
yet.

474
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,440
I'm just giving names here.

475
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,380
Two, three, three, two.

476
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,340
The degree of a node,
the degree means

477
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,100
how many edges go from it.

478
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,290
How many edges touch it.

479
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:32,890
And W is also a
great matrix, it's

480
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:42,920
called the adjacency matrix.

481
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,440
It's also beautiful.

482
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,800
Now it'll have plus ones
because I wanted minus W,

483
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:55,310
so it has, these nodes are
not adjacent to themselves

484
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,090
but it's got this
one and this one

485
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,400
and this one this one and
that one, and that's a zero.

486
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,000
So there are five,
the adjacency matrix

487
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,510
tells me which nodes are
connected to which other nodes.

488
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:13,890
And of course the connections
are going both ways.

489
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,350
So I see five ones
from five edges.

490
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,610
And I see five more
ones below the diagonal,

491
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:27,050
because the edges are
connecting both ways.

492
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,760
Ones connected to three, and
three is connected to one.

493
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,540
One is not connected to
four, and four is not

494
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,740
connected to one.

495
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,270
One is not connected to itself.

496
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,440
By an edge.

497
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,970
If we allowed, like, little
self loops, then a one

498
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,500
could appear on the diagram.

499
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,830
But we don't.

500
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,360
OK, so that's D and W.

501
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,840
Here are the key matrices.

502
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,930
This is actually, I venture to
say that any afternoon at MIT

503
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:59,980
there's a seminar that
involves these matrices.

504
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,770
One name for this is
the graph Laplacian,

505
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,490
from Laplace's equation.

506
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:11,170
And we'll see pretty soon
where that name's coming from.

507
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,370
But it's there.

508
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:19,920
And should I think, I think I
should, just about networks.

509
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,710
Like where, does the
networks come from?

510
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,700
I think we've got
networks all around us.

511
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,820
Right?

512
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:33,040
Electrical networks are the
simplest, maybe in some ways

513
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,000
the simplest to visualize.

514
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:54,970
So that's the example,
that's the language I'll use.

515
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:58,640
Now, I get a network,
I use the word network

516
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,380
when there's a c_1,
c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5.

517
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,550
Those extra numbers.

518
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,690
I've got the A,
and now the network

519
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:11,670
comes from the C part,
that diagonal matrix.

520
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:17,360
And if I'm talking electricity,
these could be resistors.

521
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,670
Instead of springs,
they're resistors.

522
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:27,160
So it's the conductance
in those five resistors,

523
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,250
are c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, and c_5.

524
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,130
So I'm ready for that.

525
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,560
Ready for the C matrix,
because we got the A matrix.

526
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:44,160
And we've got A transpose
A, but the applications

527
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,060
throw in the C matrix also.

528
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,930
What are other
applications, I was

529
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:54,510
saying, like this one is the
one, I'll use the word current,

530
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:59,080
for flow in the edges, or
I'll use the word flow.

531
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,890
A network of oil, or
natural gas, or water pipes

532
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:09,090
would be just that, and
then the electrical-- People

533
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:16,090
study the-- Professor
Verghese in Course 6 studies

534
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,210
the electric grid.

535
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,690
The US electric
grid, or the western,

536
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,470
often the western half
of the US electric grid.

537
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:27,350
So that's got a
whole lot of things.

538
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,650
Pumping stations.

539
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,490
You see it?

540
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,350
Actually, the world
wide web, the internet,

541
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:39,210
is a giant network that people
would love to understand.

542
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,270
And the phone company
would love to understand

543
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,140
those networks of phone calls.

544
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:48,090
I mean, those are really, that's
what, giant businesses are

545
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:55,360
are dependent on understanding
and maintaining networks.

546
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,540
OK, so I'm going
to use resistors.

547
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,110
Of course, I'm staying linear.

548
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:04,260
And I'm staying steady state.

549
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,680
So by staying linear there
aren't any transistors

550
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,620
in this net.

551
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,750
By staying steady state,
there aren't any capacitors

552
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,750
or inductors.

553
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,050
Those guys would
be linear elements,

554
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:20,510
but they would be coming in
a time-dependent problem.

555
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,250
A u_(tt) problem.

556
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:29,350
And I'm just staying now with
Ku=f, I'm trying to create K.

557
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,790
The stiffness matrix, which
maybe here we might call

558
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,910
the conductance matrix.

559
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,810
OK, so ready for
the picture now?

560
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:42,790
That these come into?

561
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,060
You know what the
picture looks like, it's

562
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:50,600
going to have the
usual four, we'll

563
00:31:50,600 --> 00:32:00,290
start with these potentials u at
the nodes, potentials at nodes,

564
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:05,380
so those will be
u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4.

565
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,850
Voltages, if I'm
really speaking,

566
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:18,350
those units would be volts,
and now comes the matrix A.

567
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:22,130
And now I get, what
do I get from A?

568
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,040
What do I get from A?

569
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,640
Key question.

570
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,480
If I multiply A times u, and
you know that's coming, right?

571
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,160
If I multiply A times u, so
I'll erase A transpose now,

572
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,920
because we've got that.

573
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,940
So there's A, and now I'll
make space to multiply by u,

574
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,710
alright?

575
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,650
So now I want to look at Au.

576
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,750
So A multiplies a
bunch of potentials,

577
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,520
a bunch of voltages.

578
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,630
And let's just do
this multiplication

579
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,970
and see what it produces.

580
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,490
This is the great
thing about matrices,

581
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,380
they produce something.

582
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:10,800
OK, what's the first
component of Au?

583
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,400
Of course, Au is going
to be five by five.

584
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,090
It's going to be
associated with edges.

585
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,560
Right, u's associated
with nodes, Au with edges.

586
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,850
Just, the pattern is so nice.

587
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,680
Alright, what's the
first component?

588
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,730
Just do that multiplication
and what do you get?

589
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,230
u_2-u_1.

590
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,980


591
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,840
What do you get in
the second component?

592
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,100
Do that multiplication
and you get u_3-u_1.

593
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,660
The third one will be u_3-u_2.

594
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:48,550
The fourth one would be
u_4-u_2, and the fifth one

595
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,040
will be u_4-u_3.

596
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:56,610


597
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:03,490
Just like our first
difference matrices.

598
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:12,660
But this one deals with, I mean,
our first difference matrices

599
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:17,140
were exactly like this when
the graph was all in a line.

600
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:21,490
The big step now is that
the graph is not in a line,

601
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,420
not even necessarily in a plane.

602
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:29,960
Could be in, it's a bunch
of points, and edges.

603
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,290
Actually, the position of those
points, we don't have to know

604
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,760
are they in a plane.

605
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,720
I think of them as
nodes and edges.

606
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:44,340
OK, what's the
natural name for Au?

607
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,980
I would call those potential
differences, right?

608
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,462
Voltage differences.

609
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,170
So that's what we see
here and those will

610
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:55,430
be e. e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5.

611
00:34:55,430 --> 00:35:00,120
will be potential or
voltage differences.

612
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,350
Voltage drops, you might say.

613
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,390
Potential differences,
voltage drops.

614
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:10,810
Oh well, now.

615
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:16,710
When I say voltage drops, that's
because, as we noted before,

616
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:21,440
the current goes from a
higher to a lower potential.

617
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,200
It goes in the
direction of the drop.

618
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:31,570
And I think that what we
need now is minus Au, for e.

619
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,940
So I think we need a minus
sign and it's quite common

620
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,910
to have the minus sign.

621
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:40,490
We saw it already
with least squares.

622
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:48,390
And let me say
also, so this is e.

623
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:53,060
I'll abbreviate those five e's
I just wrote down, five of them.

624
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,490
So you would remember
there are five.

625
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,180
We're talking
about the currents.

626
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,970
We're talking about,
this is the e in E=IR.

627
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:06,310
The electromotive--
The voltage drop.

628
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,680
That makes some current go.

629
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,290
Now, also, just as
with least squares,

630
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,330
so it was great that
we saw it before,

631
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,960
there could be a
source term here.

632
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,750
So I'm completing the picture
here, allowing the source term.

633
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,670
And we'll come back to what
does that mean, physically.

634
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:32,280
But at that point could
enter b, and b is really

635
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,730
standing for batteries.

636
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:40,100
I work hard to make the
language match the initials.

637
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,210
These letters.

638
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:45,590
OK, now what?

639
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:51,080
That step just involved
A, nothing physical.

640
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:57,500
Now comes the step that
involves C, so w will be Ce.

641
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,430
And these will be the
currents on the edges.

642
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:08,730
And that's the law,
then, with a matrix C,

643
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:14,670
of course C is our
old friend c_1 to c_5.

644
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,800
And tell me first the name.

645
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,720
Whose law is this?

646
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,580
That the current is proportional
to the voltage drop?

647
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,520
Ohm.

648
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,070
So this is Ohm's law.

649
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,380
Instead of Hooke's
law, it's Ohm's law.

650
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,690
And I've written it with
conductances, not resistances.

651
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:42,250
So resistances are 1 over-- R,
the usual R in E=IR, would be--

652
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,810
I'm more looking at it
as I, current, equals Ce,

653
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,140
instead of E=IR.

654
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:55,320
So I'm flipping the, the, the
resistance, or the impedance

655
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,830
to give the conductance.

656
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:04,920
OK, and now finally
can you tell me

657
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,380
what the last step
is going to be?

658
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:15,540
If life is good, well you might
wonder whether life is good,

659
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:21,300
reading the papers, but
it's still good here.

660
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,210
OK, what matrix shows up there?

661
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,170
Everybody knows it.

662
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,960
A transpose.

663
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,750
So the final equation,
the balance equation,

664
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,480
will be, let me write it so
I don't catch it up here.

665
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,690
Will be A transpose
w equals whatever.

666
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,090
Will be the balance equation.

667
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,115
The current balance,
it's the balance

668
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:48,890
of currents, balance of charge,
whatever you like to say.

669
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,740
At each node, it's the
balance at the nodes.

670
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,210
Because when we're
up on this line,

671
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,620
we're in the node picture.

672
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,920
We have four
equations here, right?

673
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,770
We're talking
about at each node.

674
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,200
Here we're talking
about on each edge.

675
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,670
There it's so critical.

676
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,910
These two variables.

677
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,230
Which we're seeing physically
as node variables and edge

678
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,040
variables.

679
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,920
That pair of variables
just shows up everywhere.

680
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,420
In displacements and stresses,
it's fundamental in elasticity.

681
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:35,360
And oh, there are just
so many in optimization,

682
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,160
it's everywhere.

683
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,340
And a big part of this course
is to see it everywhere.

684
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:46,770
OK, why don't I, just so
you see the main picture.

685
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:51,140
We're going to have the A
transpose C A matrix that I'm

686
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,000
going to maybe call K again.

687
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,910
And now of course there
could be current sources.

688
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:04,110
Just the way there could be
forces that we had to balance.

689
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:08,540
There could be, not
always but there could be,

690
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,470
current sources from outside.

691
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,410
External current sources.

692
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,230
So these are external
voltage sources.

693
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,480
These are external
current sources.

694
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,810
So in a way, we now have
combined our first two

695
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:28,650
examples, our springs and
masses only had forces external.

696
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:33,280
Our least squares problem
had an external b.

697
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,380
Measurements.

698
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,930
This picture is the whole deal.

699
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,420
It's got b and f, and
actually I could put in

700
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:46,050
even a little more.

701
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:55,940
Sources like, well, we already
kind of caught on to the fact

702
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,720
that we'd better ground the
node or A transpose C A,

703
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,530
as it stands, A transpose C A
as it stands will be singular.

704
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,670
You know, it's the matrix,
there's A transpose A

705
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,130
and the C in the middle
isn't going to help any.

706
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,790
That's singular.

707
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:17,720
If we wanted to be able
to compute voltages,

708
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,774
we've got to set one of them.

709
00:41:19,774 --> 00:41:21,190
It's like setting
one temperature,

710
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,990
it's like deciding
where is absolute zero.

711
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:29,740
Let's put absolute
zero down here. u_4=0.

712
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,260
Grounded the node.

713
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,900
OK, so we've fixed a potential.

714
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,350
So here's a boundary
condition coming in u_4=0.

715
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,050


716
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,040
That's another source
term, another thing coming,

717
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,880
you could say sort of from
outside the A transpose C

718
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,660
A. We could fix
another voltage at,

719
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:58,270
I mean, I'm thinking now
about what's the picture.

720
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:04,430
What's the whole problem?

721
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:09,300
So the problem could have
batteries, in the edges.

722
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,170
It could have current
sources into the nodes.

723
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:19,340
It could fix u_1 at
some voltage like ten.

724
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,690
Our problem could fix--
We must fix one of them.

725
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:28,420
Otherwise our matrix
isn't-- is singular.

726
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,250
But once we've
set up the matrix,

727
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,580
and when we fix
u_4=0 by the way,

728
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,510
what happens to our matrix?

729
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:39,430
Let me take u_4=0, so
this is a key step here.

730
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:43,500
When I set u_4=0,
I now know u_4.

731
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,620
It's not an unknown any more.

732
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:52,440
So I've removed u_4
from the problem.

733
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,730
And then it'll be also
removed from A transpose A.

734
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:58,450
So this, is you could
say, like a reduced A,

735
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:03,410
or a grounded matrix A.
It's now five by three.

736
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,490
And A transpose
A, what shape will

737
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:08,720
the a transpose a matrix be?

738
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,760
It'll be three by three, right?

739
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,520
I now have five by
three, three by five.

740
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,640
Multiplying five by three
gives me three by three.

741
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,150
This column is gone,
and that row is gone.

742
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:24,370
Because the row came from
A transpose and the column

743
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,360
came from A, and we've
just thrown them away.

744
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,570
By grounding that node.

745
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:37,510
Now give me the key fact about
that A transpose A matrix?

746
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,320
What do you see there?

747
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:44,010
Now, you see a reduced,
a grounded A transpose A.

748
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,720
What kind of a
matrix have I got?

749
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,740
Positive definite.

750
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,240
Good.

751
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,870
Positive definite.

752
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:54,410
It's now not singular
any more, its determinant

753
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,540
is some positive number.

754
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:00,200
And everything is positive, its
eigenvalues are all positive,

755
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,510
everything's good
about that matrix.

756
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:07,600
OK, and I guess what I
was starting to say here,

757
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:13,860
if I wanted to fix, this
would be a natural problem.

758
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,870
Fix the top voltage at one, say.

759
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:22,040
Fix u_1=1 and see how
much current flows.

760
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,170
That would be a
natural question.

761
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:28,100
What's the system resistance
between the top node

762
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:33,180
and the bottom, if I'm given--
Or the system conductance.

763
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:40,530
If I'm given a c_1, a c_2,
a c_3 a c_4 and a c_5,

764
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,740
I could say I could fix
that voltage at one,

765
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,340
I could fix this at zero.

766
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,030
Maybe one of the
homework problems

767
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:48,410
asks you for
something like this.

768
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:52,430
And then you find
all the currents.

769
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,900
And the voltages, you
solve the problem.

770
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,820
And you know what
the currents are.

771
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,860
You know the total current
that leaves node one,

772
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:07,880
enters node four when the
voltages drop by one between,

773
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,410
right?

774
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:11,490
So current can flow down
here, cross over here,

775
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,720
down here whatever.

776
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,040
Somehow all these
five numbers are

777
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:21,760
going to play a part in
that system resistance.

778
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,640
So that would be an
interesting number to know.

779
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,820
Out of those five
numbers, somehow five c's,

780
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,997
there's a system resistance
between that node

781
00:45:31,997 --> 00:45:32,580
and that node.

782
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,100
And we can find it by
setting this to be one,

783
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,090
this to be zero, having the
reduced matrix-- Oh, well

784
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,150
what will happen?

785
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:43,640
How many unknowns will I have?

786
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,780
Just do this mental experiment.

787
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:51,180
Suppose I introduce u_1
to be one, for example.

788
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,270
This is just one type
of possible problem.

789
00:45:54,270 --> 00:46:03,320
If I take u_1 to be one,
what happens to my matrix A?

790
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,850
It loses its first column, too.
u_1 is not unknown any more.

791
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:12,300
u_1 will not be unknown.

792
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,445
And that value one
is somehow going

793
00:46:15,445 --> 00:46:17,990
to move to the
right-hand side, right?

794
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,200
People have asked
me after class, well

795
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,200
what happens if a boundary
condition isn't zero?

796
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,990
Suppose we have
this fixed springs

797
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:32,090
and we pull this spring down
to make its displacement 12.

798
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,410
Well, somehow that 12
is going to show up

799
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:36,460
on the right side
of the equation.

800
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,390
It's a source, it's
an external term.

801
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:43,040
OK, so if we had
u_1 equals whatever,

802
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,990
this u_1 would disappear.

803
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,350
I would only have a
two by two problem.

804
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:49,380
Because I would
only have two, I now

805
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,400
have only two
unknown u's, right?

806
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,550
So that's where
sources can come.

807
00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:01,920
And can I just complete the
picture of the source stuff?

808
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:08,450
We could fix, we could.

809
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,590
Look, here's what
I'm going to say.

810
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:12,210
External stuff.

811
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:15,630
Sources can come into here.

812
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,450
They can come into here.

813
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,730
They can come into here,
so of course everybody

814
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,010
says why shouldn't
they come in here?

815
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,930
And the answer is we
could send them here.

816
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:33,470
So we could fix, we
could fix some w's.

817
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:36,040
Of course, you understand
we can't do everything.

818
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:41,720
I mean, there's a limit to how
much we can put on the system.

819
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,530
We want to have
some unknowns left.

820
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,770
Some matrix still, but anyway.

821
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:50,790
I like this picture
now, it's more complete.

822
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:57,470
That you now see the node
variables and node equations,

823
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:00,220
the edge variables, e and w.

824
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,830
The currents.

825
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:06,380
These guys are the
big ones. w and u

826
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,700
are what I think of as
the crucial unknowns.

827
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,480
e is sort of on the
way. f is the source.

828
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,300
But now we have the
possibility of sources

829
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,680
at all four positions.

830
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,340
OK, let's see.

831
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:31,270
If I wrote out, If I
looked at A transpose C A,

832
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:34,560
would you like to tell me, yeah.

833
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,460
Have we got?

834
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,460
No, we don't.

835
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,940
I was going to say, what's a
typical row of A transpose C A,

836
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,480
can I just say it in words?

837
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,980
It'll be too quick
to really catch.

838
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,630
So without the C,
this is what we had.

839
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,970
So what do you think
that two becomes

840
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:56,400
if there's an A transpose C A,
if there's a C in the middle.

841
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,970
Have you got the pattern yet?

842
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:02,400
That two was there
because of two edges.

843
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,350
Edges one and two,
it happened to be.

844
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:10,980
So instead of the two,
I'm going to see c_1+c_2.

845
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,480
Right.

846
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,320
When those were
ones, I got the two.

847
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,630
So this will be c_1+c_2,
this'll be a minus c_1,

848
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:21,300
and that'll be a minus
c_2, when we do it out.

849
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,920
And you could do it
out for yourself.

850
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,380
Just tell me what
would show up there.

851
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:31,510
In A transpose C A, so I'm
talking now about A transpose C

852
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:37,520
A. So instead of one plus
one plus one, what do I have?

853
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,480
What am I going to have, and you
really want to multiply it out,

854
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,500
because it's so nice
to see it happen.

855
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,570
What do I have?

856
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:50,410
I'm looking at node two, I'm
seeing three edges out of it.

857
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:56,740
And instead of one, one,
one, I'll have c_1+c_3+c_4.

858
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:00,110
c_1+c_3+c_4 will
be sitting here.

859
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:02,870
And minus c_1 will be here,
and minus c_3 will be here,

860
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:06,150
and minus c_4 will be there.

861
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:08,110
The pattern's just nice.

862
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:14,230
So if you can read this
part of the section,

863
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:19,330
I'll have more to say
Friday about the A transpose

864
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,760
w, the balance.

865
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,160
That critical point
we didn't do yet.

866
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,150
But the main thing,
you've got it.
