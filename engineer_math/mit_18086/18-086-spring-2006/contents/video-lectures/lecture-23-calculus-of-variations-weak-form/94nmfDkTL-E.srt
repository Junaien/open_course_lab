6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,790
PROFESSOR: Let's get started.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:25,510
Could I start first with
an announcement of a talk

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,670
this afternoon.

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,350
I know your schedules
are full, but --

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,020
the abstract for the talk I
think will go up on the top

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,730
of our web page.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,200
It's a whole range
of other applications

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,550
that I would hope to
get to, by an expert.

14
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,140
Professor Rannacher,
his applications

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,750
include optimal control,
which is certainly

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,610
a big area of optimization.

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:04,160
Actually, MathWorks, we think
of them as doing linear algebra,

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,910
but their number one customer
is the control theory world,

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,070
and it totally connects
with everything we're doing.

20
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,220
He's also interested in adaptive
meshing for finite element

21
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,700
or other methods -- how to
refine the mesh where it pays

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:32,720
off in arrow problems,
all sorts of problems.

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,350
The math behind it is this
same saddle point structure,

24
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,270
same KK -- when he
says KKT equations,

25
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,390
that's our two equations.

26
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,670
I've been calling them,
sometimes, Kuhn-Tucker,

27
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,830
but after Kuhn
and Tucker, it was

28
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:55,370
noticed that a graduate
student named Karush, also a K,

29
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,740
had written a Masters thesis in
which these important equations

30
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,740
appeared.

31
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,590
So now, they're often
called KKT equations.

32
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,920
I think Rannacher will do that.

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,220
Anyway, I don't
know if you're free,

34
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:17,300
but it'll be a full talk in this
program of computational design

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,360
and optimization.

36
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,100
I don't know if you know
MIT's new masters degree

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,590
program in CDO.

38
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,800
So it's mostly engineering,
a little optimization

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,160
that's down in
Operations Research,

40
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,140
and a couple of guys in math.

41
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,490
So that's a talk
this afternoon, which

42
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,560
will be right on
target for this area

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,690
and bring up applications
that are highly important.

44
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,652
Well, so I thought
today, my job is going

45
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:55,860
to be pretty straightforward.

46
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,300
I want to do now the
continuous problem.

47
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,020
So I have functions as unknowns.

48
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,360
I have integrals
as inner products.

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,410
But I still have a
minimization problem.

50
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,100
So I have a minimization
problem and I'll call,

51
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,300
it's often a
potential energy, so

52
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,460
let me use P. Our
unknown function is u,

53
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,620
so that's a function u of
x; u of x, y; u of x, y, z.

54
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,320
And instead of inner
products we have integrals,

55
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,810
so there's a c of x.

56
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,960
This is going to be
a pure quadratic,

57
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,770
so it's going to lead
me to a linear equation.

58
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,250
In between comes
something important --

59
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:53,250
what people now call the
weak form of the equation.

60
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:59,580
So, this is would
be the simplest

61
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:07,042
example I could put forward
of the calculus of variations.

62
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:08,500
So that's what
we're talking about.

63
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,240
Calculus of variations.

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,360
What's the derivative
of P with respect to u?

65
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,120
Somehow, that's what
we have to find,

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,810
and we're going to set
it to zero to minimize.

67
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,800
Then why do we know
it's a minimum?

68
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,860
Well, that's always
the second --

69
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,060
the quadratic terms here
are going to be positive.

70
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,980
So we have a positive
definite problem.

71
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,200
Positive definite means
things go this way, convex,

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,560
and you locate the
bottom, the minimum

73
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,130
is where the derivative is zero.

74
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,410
But what's the derivative?

75
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,680
That's the question.

76
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,800
It's not even called
derivative in this subject,

77
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,110
it's called the first variation.

78
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,630
Instead of saying
first derivative,

79
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,740
I'll say first variation.

80
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,700
And instead of writing
dP/du, I'll write --

81
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,980
where can I write it?

82
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,455
So this is key word,
so this is going

83
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:18,660
to be the first
variation, and I'm

84
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,080
going to write it with a
different d, a Greek delta,

85
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,490
dP/du.

86
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,510
It's just sort of a
reminder that we're

87
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,422
dealing with functions
and integrals of functions

88
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:33,300
and so on.

89
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,210
So it's just change the
notation in the name

90
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:42,150
a little as a trigger
to the memory.

91
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,840
But this board
really has a lot --

92
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,230
not all the details
are here, of course.

93
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:56,030
This is a summary of what the
calculus of variations does.

94
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,660
So it takes a
minimization problem.

95
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,840
So I'm looking for
a function u of x.

96
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,720
And always since we're
in continuous problems,

97
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,490
we have boundary conditions.

98
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:17,390
So as always, those could be --
let me imagine that those are

99
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,800
the boundary conditions.

100
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,950
So I would call those
essential conditions.

101
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,600
Every function that's
allowed into the minimum

102
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,050
has to satisfy the
boundary condition.

103
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,039
So it's a minimum over all u
with the boundary conditions,

104
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,330
with those boundary conditions.

105
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:42,510
There are two kinds of
boundary conditions,

106
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,940
and maybe I'll postpone thinking
about boundary conditions

107
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,740
till I get the equations,
the differential

108
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,970
equation inside the interval.

109
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,360
So all these intervals
go from zero to one.

110
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,010
I won't put that.

111
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:56,710
We're in 1D.

112
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,890
So, how do you find
the function, u of x?

113
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,990
that stands for du/dx.

114
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,340
So the given data
for the problem

115
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,985
is some load, some
source term, f

116
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:16,820
of x, which is going to show
up on the right-hand side,

117
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,740
and some coefficient
c of x, which is going

118
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,180
to show up in the equation.

119
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,570
They depend on x, in general.

120
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,330
Many, many, many physical
problems look like this.

121
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,700
Sort of steady-state
problems, I would say.

122
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,330
I'm not talking about
Navier-Stokes fluid flow

123
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:45,340
convection, I'm talking about
static problems, first of all.

124
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:53,030
So here's the general idea of
the calculus of variations.

125
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,050
It's the same as the
general idea of calculus.

126
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:03,860
How do you identify a
minimum in calculus?

127
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,440
If the minimum is at u,
you perturb it a little,

128
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,720
by some delta u, that I'm going
to call v to have just one

129
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,970
letter instead of two here.

130
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,260
You say OK, if I look at that
neighboring point, u plus delta

131
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:29,490
u, my quantity is bigger.

132
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,460
The minimum is at u.

133
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,370
So we're remembering calculus --
I guess I'm saying I've written

134
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:39,980
that here.

135
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,470
Compare u with u plus
v, which you could

136
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,920
think of as u plus delta u.

137
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,790
It's like -- v you might think
of as a small movement away

138
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,390
from the best function.

139
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,740
In calculus it's
a small movement

140
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,650
away from the best point.

141
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,300
So let me draw the calculus.

142
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,950
If you think of this blackboard
as being function space instead

143
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,730
of just a blackboard, then I'm
doing calculus of variations.

144
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,540
But let me just
do calculus here.

145
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,330
So there's the minimum, at u.

146
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,930
And here is u plus v near it.

147
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,740
Could be on this side or
it could be on this side.

148
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,020
Those are both u plus
v. Well, you maybe

149
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,100
want me to call one
of them u minus v.

150
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,870
But the point is v
could have either sign.

151
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,230
I'm looking at minimum
sort of inside, where I can

152
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,410
go to the right or the left.

153
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,240
So what's the deal?

154
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,090
Well, that point is then that
at that point or at that point

155
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,430
or at any of these other
points, P of u plus v

156
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,400
is bigger then what
it is at the minimum.

157
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,110
That tells us that
u is the winner.

158
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:04,040
Now how do we get an
equation out of that?

159
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,860
Calculus comes in now.

160
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,800
We expand this thing -- this is
some small movement away from

161
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,890
u.

162
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,220
So we expand it, we look at
the leading term -- well,

163
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,420
of course, the leading
term is P of u.

164
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,730
Then what is the next term?

165
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,190
What's the first-order,
first variation

166
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,910
in P when I vary u to u plus v?

167
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,550
Well, it's the whole point
of calculus, actually.

168
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,290
The central point of calculus
is that this is some function

169
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:49,940
that we call P prime of u times
v, plus order of v squared.

170
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,420
When v is small, v
squared is very small.

171
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,640
So what's our equation?

172
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,490
Well, if this has to be
bigger than P of u --

173
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,050
I could just cancel P of u --
so this thing has to be bigger

174
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,600
equal zero now.

175
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,090
I've squeezed it in a corner,
but since it's calculus

176
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,580
we kind of remember it.

177
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,205
Also, it's easy to learn
calculus and forget

178
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:20,460
the main point.

179
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,250
So this has to be
greater equal zero.

180
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,530
Now this is going to
be -- if v is small,

181
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,630
this is going to be very
small, so it won't help.

182
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:35,910
So this thing had
better be zero, right?

183
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,750
That had better be zero.

184
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,700
Because if it isn't zero, I
could take v of the right sign

185
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,040
to make it positive,
and take v small, so

186
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,610
that this would dominate this.

187
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,730
Maybe I wanted to take
v of the right sign

188
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,190
to make that negative anyway.

189
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,930
I need P prime of u to be zero.

190
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,300
So that's what I end up with,
of course, as everybody knew.

191
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,810
That P prime of
u had to be zero.

192
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,130
So in that tiny picture,
I've remembered what we know.

193
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:19,920
Now let me come
back to what we have

194
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,310
to do when we have functions.

195
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,690
So what happened?

196
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,060
I compare P of u -- u is
now a function, u of x --

197
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:39,360
with P of u plus v.
So I plug in u plus v,

198
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,840
I compare with what
I get with only u,

199
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,020
and what's the difference?

200
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,670
I look at the difference
and the difference

201
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:56,724
will have a linear term from
u prime plus v prime squared

202
00:12:56,724 --> 00:12:59,265
and then I'm going to take away
the u prime squared because I

203
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:01,070
gotta compare the two.

204
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,070
So what's left?

205
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,600
There will be a 2
u prime, v prime.

206
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,500
I'm maybe just being lazy here.

207
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,740
I'm asking you to do
it mentally and then

208
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,720
I'll do it a little better.

209
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,170
So the difference in
this comparison is a 2 u

210
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,670
prime v prime times
c, and the 2's cancel.

211
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,170
There's the difference
right there.

212
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,540
What's the difference
over in this term?

213
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,150
Well, I have that
term and then I

214
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,370
have the same term with u plus
v, and then when I subtract,

215
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,020
I just have the term with v.

216
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:46,610
So this is the dP/du that
has to be zero for every v.

217
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,440
Now I'm really saying
the important thing.

218
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,470
This weak form is
like saying this

219
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:02,990
has to be zero for every
v. Then, of course,

220
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,800
in this scalar case, it
was like a very small step

221
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,580
to decide, well, if this
is zero for every v,

222
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,720
then that's zero, which
is the strong form.

223
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,540
Are you with me?

224
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,190
So we have a minimum
problem, minimize P,

225
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,600
we have a weak form,
the first variation,

226
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
the first derivative,
the first-order term

227
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,730
has to be zero for every v. Then
if it's zero for every v, that

228
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:39,630
forces the derivative to be
zero and that's the strong form.

229
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:47,570
Now over here it
took more space.

230
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,600
But the ultimate
idea is the same.

231
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,550
We looked at P of
u plus v compared

232
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,480
with P of u, subtracted,
looked at the linear term

233
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,550
and there it is,
the first variation.

234
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:05,990
That has to be zero
for every v. I'll just

235
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,590
mentioned boundary
conditions now,

236
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,440
as long as we're
at this weak form.

237
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,570
Don't think of this weak form as
just some mathematical nonsense

238
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,680
to get to the
differential equation,

239
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,860
because the weak form is the
foundation for the finite

240
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,730
element method -- all
sorts of discrete methods,

241
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,510
discretization methods will
begin with the weak form,

242
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:36,980
the weighted integral form,
rather than the strong form.

243
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,720
I was just going to say a word
about boundary conditions.

244
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,810
What are the boundary
conditions on v?

245
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:55,730
So you could say well, v stands
for a virtual displacement.

246
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,510
Virtual meaning kind of
we just imagining it,

247
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:05,700
it's a displacement that we can
imagine moving by that amount,

248
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,690
but the whole point is the
nature fix the minimum.

249
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,940
What's the boundary condition?

250
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,270
Well, all the candidates have
to satisfy these boundary

251
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:17,900
conditions.

252
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,870
So I have to have u plus v
at zero also has to equal a,

253
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,050
and u plus v at 1
also has to equal b,

254
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,370
if I took these simple
boundary conditions.

255
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,190
So, by subtraction, I learn
the boundary conditions

256
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:44,880
on v. When I say all v, I
mean v of zero has to be what?

257
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,740
Zero.

258
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,800
And v of 1 has to be zero --
when we had those boundary

259
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,809
conditions.

260
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,350
Different problems could bring
different boundary conditions,

261
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,560
of course, but this is
easier than -- simplest.

262
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,350
So when I say all v,
I mean every function

263
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,930
that starts at zero
and ends at zero

264
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,870
is a candidate in
this weak form.

265
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,900
I have to get the answer
zero for all those functions.

266
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:21,320
Now somehow, I want
to get to this point,

267
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,710
the differential equation, and
why don't we give it the name

268
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:34,100
that everybody -- the two guys'
names, Euler-Lagrange -- well,

269
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,320
pretty famous names.

270
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,350
This is the
Euler-Lagrange equation.

271
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,330
So maybe before where I said
Kuhn-Tucker or something,

272
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,060
if I'm talking about
differential equations,

273
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,160
I go back to these guys.

274
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,720
Now, how did I get from
weak form to strong form?

275
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,130
That's a key.

276
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,540
If you see these two steps
from the minimum principle

277
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:13,820
to the weak form, that's
just, again, plug in u plus v,

278
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,430
subtract and take
the linear part.

279
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,100
Then it's true for all v's.

280
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,780
Now, how do I get
from here to here?

281
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:32,780
Notice that this form
is an integrated form.

282
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,370
This form is at every point.

283
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,620
So it's much stronger
and much more demanding.

284
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,060
You could say OK, that
gives us the equation --

285
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,450
that's the equation as
we usually see them.

286
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,060
I'll do 2D and that'll be
Laplace's equation or somebody

287
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:59,100
else's equation, but
minimal surface equation,

288
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,610
all sorts of equations.

289
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,590
Everything.

290
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,460
All sorts of
applications including

291
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,080
this afternoon's lecture.

292
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,820
How to get from here to here?

293
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,440
Well, there's one trick in
advanced calculus, actually.

294
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,050
The most important trick
in advanced calculus

295
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,550
is integration by parts.

296
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,070
Well, we use those words,
integration by parts,

297
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,120
in 1D here.

298
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,330
So I'll do that.

299
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,870
We use maybe somebody
else's name --

300
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,000
Green's formula or
Green's theorem,

301
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,060
or Green-Gauss or the
divergence theorem or whatever,

302
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,930
in more dimensions.

303
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,740
But 1D, I just
integrate by parts.

304
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,760
Do you remember how
integration by parts goes?

305
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:58,120
I want to get v by
itself, but I got v prime,

306
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,260
because when I plugged in
u plus v here, out came --

307
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,920
it's the derivative so
I've got a derivative.

308
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,250
So how do I get rid
of a derivative?

309
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,770
Integrate by parts.

310
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:12,570
Take the derivative off of v --
can I just do that this quick

311
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,170
way?

312
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:19,090
Put the derivative onto
-- I almost said onto u.

313
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,670
I'm doing integration by parts
and saying how important it is

314
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,140
but not writing out every step.

315
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,260
So I take the derivative off
of this and I put it onto this,

316
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:42,530
and it's gotta be -- and a minus
sign appears when I do that.

317
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:46,130
Where the heck am I gonna
put that minus sign?

318
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,210
Right in there.

319
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,950
Minus.

320
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,060
Then everybody knows that
there's also a boundary term,

321
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,770
right?

322
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,660
So I have to squeeze somewhere
in this boundary term.

323
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,380
So now that I've done
an integration by parts,

324
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:09,930
the boundary term will be
the v times the c u prime

325
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:16,165
at the ends of the interval.

326
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:17,040
I think that's right.

327
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,670
What we hope is
that that goes away.

328
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,230
Well, of course, if it
doesn't, then we have to --

329
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,520
that there's a good reason that
we don't want it to, but here

330
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,490
it's nice if it goes away.

331
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,630
You see that it
does, because we just

332
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,110
decided that the
boundary conditions on v

333
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:48,070
were zero at both ends.

334
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:52,900
So, v being zero at both
ends kills that term.

335
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,410
So now, do you see
what I have here?

336
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,250
I could write it a
little more cleanly.

337
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,910
The whole point is that the v --
I now have v there and I have v

338
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,180
there so I can
factor v out of this.

339
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,900
Just put it there.

340
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,120
That was a good move.

341
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,500
This minus sign
is still in here.

342
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:28,170
So I now have the integral of
some function times v is zero.

343
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,240
That's what I'm looking for.

344
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,710
The integral of some
function, some stuff, times v,

345
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:40,230
and v can be
anything -- is zero.

346
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,200
What happens now?

347
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,360
This integral has to
be zero for every v.

348
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,930
So if this stuff had
a little bump up,

349
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,030
I could take a v to
have the same bump

350
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,640
and the integral
wouldn't be zero.

351
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,740
So this stuff can't bump
up, it can't bump down,

352
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,840
it can't do anything.

353
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,560
It has to be zero and
that's the strong form.

354
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,030
So the strong form is with
this minus sign in there,

355
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:16,120
minus the derivative -- see,
an extra derivative came onto

356
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,230
the c u prime because
it came off the v,

357
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:25,980
and the f was just sitting
there in the linear,

358
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,310
in the no derivative.

359
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,630
So, do you see that pattern?

360
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,060
You may have seen it before,
but calculus variations

361
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,560
have sort of
disappeared as a subject

362
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:50,590
to teach in advanced calculus.

363
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,110
It used to be here in courses
that Professor Hildebrand

364
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,420
taught.

365
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,560
But actually it comes back
because we so much need

366
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:05,600
the weak form in finite
elements and other methods.

367
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:14,250
What I wrote over here is
the discrete equivalent.

368
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:24,580
I can't resist looking at the
matrix form, for two reasons.

369
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,300
First, it's simpler
and it copies this.

370
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,960
Do you see how this
is a copy of that?

371
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,760
That matrix form
is supposed to be

372
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,560
exactly analogous to
this continuous form.

373
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,880
Why is that?

374
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,540
Because u transpose f, that's
an inner product of u with f --

375
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,040
that's what this is.

376
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,320
That integral.

377
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:52,610
A*u is u prime in this analogy.

378
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:57,950
So this is u prime times c
times u prime with the 1/2,

379
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,711
and that, again, that transpose
is telling us inner product

380
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:03,210
integral.

381
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:11,210
So if I forget u prime and
think of it as a matrix problem,

382
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,860
that's my minimum
problem for matrices.

383
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:25,560
I want to find an equation
for the winning u.

384
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,710
In the end, this is
going to be the equation.

385
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,850
That's the equation
that minimizes that.

386
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:39,390
Half of 18.085 was
about this problem.

387
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,979
Well, I concentrated
in 18.085 on this one,

388
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:44,520
because minimum principles are
just that little bit trickier,

389
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,160
so that's 18.086.

390
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,650
And then, in between,
something people seldom

391
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,470
write about but, of
course, it's going to work,

392
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:07,070
is that I change u to u plus v,
I multiply it out, I subtract,

393
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,960
I look at the term linear
in v, and that's it.

394
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,390
That would be if I make
that just a minus sign

395
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,650
and put it all together
the way I did here,

396
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,900
that's the same thing.

397
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,270
So this is the weak form.

398
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,824
This is the minimum form,
this is the weak form,

399
00:26:27,824 --> 00:26:28,990
and this is the strong form.

400
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,020
You see that weak form?

401
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:48,560
Somehow in the discrete case,
it's pretty clear that --

402
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,290
let's see.

403
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:55,440
I could write this as --
you see, it's u transpose,

404
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,770
A transpose C*A*v
equal f transpose v.

405
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,280
The conclusion is if
this holds for every v,

406
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,820
then this is the same as this.

407
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:11,560
If two things have the same
inner product with every vector

408
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,630
v, they're the same, and
that's the strong form.

409
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:20,730
You'd have to transpose the
whole thing, but no problem.

410
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:32,490
So now I guess I've tried to
give the main sequence of logic

411
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,260
in the continuous
case, and it's parallel

412
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:42,020
in the discrete case
for this example.

413
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,320
For this specific example
because it's the easiest.

414
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:54,460
Let me do what Euler and
Lagrange did by extending

415
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,170
to a larger class of examples.

416
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:01,680
So now our minimization
is still an integral --

417
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,880
I'll still stay in 1D, I'll
still keep these boundary

418
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,620
conditions, but I'm going
to allow some more general

419
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,390
expression here.

420
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:17,040
Instead of that pure quadratic,
this could be whatever.

421
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,650
Now I'm going to do
calculus of variations.

422
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,950
Still in 1D.

423
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:33,700
Calculus of variations,
minimize the integral

424
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:45,270
of some function of u and
u prime with the boundary

425
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,170
conditions, and I'll
keep those nice.

426
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,150
So that integral's
still 0 to 1 and I'll

427
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:54,050
keep these nice
boundary conditions just

428
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,570
to make my life easy.

429
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:01,080
So that will lead to v of
zero being zero, and v of 1

430
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,770
being zero.

431
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,690
What do I have to do?

432
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,460
Again, I have to
plug in u plus v

433
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,350
and compare this result with
the same thing having u plus v.

434
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:24,840
So essentially I've
got to compare F

435
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,900
at u plus v, u plus u prime
plus v prime with F of u and u

436
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,350
prime.

437
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:40,550
I have to find the leading
term in the difference.

438
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,450
So I'll just find
out leading term,

439
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,170
and then will come the integral.

440
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,040
But the first job is
really the leading term,

441
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,790
and it's calculus, of course.

442
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,730
Now can we do that one?

443
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,970
It's pure calculus.

444
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:11,130
I have a function
at two variables,

445
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,610
the function of u and u prime.

446
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,920
Actually, I did here.

447
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,050
I had a u prime
there and a u there.

448
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,000
Once I write it down you're
going to say sure, of course,

449
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,220
I knew that.

450
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,050
So I have a function
of two variables

451
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:39,070
and I'm looking for
a little change.

452
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:48,700
So a little change in the first
argument produces the dF --

453
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:55,040
the derivative of F with respect
to that first argument times

454
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:01,160
the delta u, which is
what I'm calling v.

455
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,431
That's the part that the
dependence on u is responsible

456
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:05,930
for.

457
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:09,400
Now there's also a
dependence on u prime.

458
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,340
So I have the derivative
of F with respect

459
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:19,400
to u prime times the little
movement in u prime, which

460
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,200
is v prime.

461
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,800
I can't leave it
with an equal there,

462
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,080
because that's only
the linearized part,

463
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,630
but that's all I
really care about.

464
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:43,700
This is order of v squared
and v prime squared.

465
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,920
Higher order, which
is not going to --

466
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,750
when I think of v as
small, v prime as small,

467
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:58,200
then the linear part dominates.

468
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,247
So can you see
what dP/du is now?

469
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:05,330
Now I've got to integrate.

470
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,510
I integrate this,
that very same thing.

471
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:18,460
This -- dx.

472
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:28,320
That has to be zero for all
v. You don't mind if I lazily

473
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:35,110
don't copy that into the
-- that's the weak form.

474
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:43,930
This was the minimum form,
now I've got to the weak form.

475
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,310
This is the first variation.

476
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:56,470
The integral of the change in F,
which has two components, when

477
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,510
there's a little change in u.

478
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,170
I should be doing an
example, but allow

479
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:14,280
me to just keep going here
until we get to the strong form.

480
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,690
So this is the weak
form for every v.

481
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,600
Let me just repeat that the
weak form is quite important

482
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,880
because, in the
finite element method,

483
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,280
we have the v's are
the test functions,

484
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,770
and we discretize
the v's -- you know,

485
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,730
we have a finite number
of test functions.

486
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:41,050
Well, I can't go entirely
-- I'll come back to finite

487
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,250
elements.

488
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,815
Let me stay with this
continuous problem, calculus

489
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,550
of variations problem.

490
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:55,490
v is v of x here, and it
satisfies these boundary

491
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:55,990
conditions.

492
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:01,880
That's the only requirement that
we need to think about here.

493
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,950
What's the strong form?

494
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:11,510
Also called the
Euler-Lagrange equation.

495
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,530
How do I get to
that strong form?

496
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,350
How did I get to it before?

497
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:23,230
I would like to get this
into something times v. Here

498
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,570
I've got something
times v but I've also

499
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,380
got something times v prime.

500
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,910
I wanted to get it
like up here where

501
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,560
it was times v. What do I do?

502
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,630
You know what I do.

503
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,420
There's only the one idea here.

504
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,020
Integrate by parts.

505
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:54,450
So I have the integral --
well, dF/du*v was no problem --

506
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,190
that had the v that I like.

507
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:06,000
But it's this other guy that
has a v prime and I want v. So,

508
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,410
it doesn't take
too much thinking.

509
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:15,740
Integrate by parts, take
the derivative off of v,

510
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,240
get a minus sign, and
put a derivative --

511
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,650
can I do it with a prime,
but I'll do better below --

512
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,260
onto this, and then
there's a boundary term,

513
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,110
but the boundary term goes
away because of the boundary

514
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:32,620
condition.

515
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:45,450
So now I have the v. Can
I make it on this board?

516
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,910
There's the dF*du multiplying
v, and then there's the minus --

517
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:56,810
this is the derivative d
by dx of dF / d u prime.

518
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:02,680
Now all that is
multiplying v and giving me

519
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,500
the integral of zero.

520
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:10,450
I promise to write
that bigger now.

521
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,180
But, again, the
central point was

522
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:18,740
to get the linear term times v.
That's always the main point.

523
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,940
Then what's the conclusion?

524
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,780
What's the
Euler-Lagrange equation?

525
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:32,150
This integral is this quantity
times v and v can be anything,

526
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,680
and I've got to get zero.

527
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,120
So, what's the equation?

528
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,430
That stuff in brackets is zero.

529
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,440
That's the
Euler-Lagrange equation.

530
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,050
Finally, let me just
write it down here.

531
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:52,020
Euler-Lagrange strong form.

532
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:07,440
In this general problem it would
be dF/du minus d by dx of dF /

533
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,840
d u prime equals zero.

534
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,250
Would you like me
to put on what a --

535
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,940
if F happened to depend
on u double prime,

536
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,390
it would be a plus -- this
would be what would happen --

537
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:29,640
just so you get the
pattern -- equaling zero.

538
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,430
So I've gone one step
further by allowing

539
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:38,730
f to depend on curvature,
and writing down

540
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:45,320
what the resulting term would be
in the Euler-Lagrange equation.

541
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,650
Could you figure out
why it would be that?

542
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,420
Where would this
thing have come from?

543
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,705
It would have come from --
there would have been a dF / d u

544
00:37:55,705 --> 00:38:01,690
double prime times v double
prime in the weak form.

545
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:06,020
Then I would have done two
integrations by parts --

546
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:12,530
two minus signs making a plus,
two derivatives moving off of v

547
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:19,310
and onto the other thing
and it would give me that.

548
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:23,910
All times v, but now I've
got everything times v,

549
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:29,640
it's true for every v, so
the quantity has to be zero.

550
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,440
That's the
Euler-Lagrange equation,

551
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,690
strong form for 1D problem.

552
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,620
Yes?

553
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]?

554
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,040
PROFESSOR: Oh, you're right.

555
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,750
You're right.

556
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:53,900
If we had this situation
then we would be up to --

557
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,880
this would typically be a
fourth-order equation and we

558
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,390
would have two boundary
conditions at each end.

559
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,450
Absolutely.

560
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:06,310
When I slipped in this just
to sort of show the pattern,

561
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,180
I didn't account for
the boundary conditions.

562
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,490
That would be one
level up as well.

563
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,620
Exactly.

564
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,560
And nature -- well, fortunately
we don't get many equations

565
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,220
of higher degree than four.

566
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:28,050
This would be like the beam
equation, the parallel to that

567
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:32,790
would be a beam
equation or a plate

568
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,810
equation or a shell
equation, God forbid.

569
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,630
In shell theory
they're incredibly

570
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,500
complicated because
they're on surfaces.

571
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,870
But the pattern is always this.

572
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,250
Well, and, of
course, they're also

573
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,060
complicated because
they're in 2D.

574
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,340
So maybe I should
say a little bit.

575
00:39:54,340 --> 00:40:00,830
Could I maybe write -- I'm
trying to do a lot today.

576
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:05,260
Trying to do kind of
the formal stuff today.

577
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,420
So another step in
the formal stuff

578
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:12,520
would be to get into 2D,
which I haven't done.

579
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,260
What would be the
famous 2D problem that

580
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,430
leads to Laplace's equation?

581
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:25,470
So 2D, what would I
minimize, just to --

582
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:35,270
so P of u would be a double
integral of du/dx squared --

583
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:41,830
maybe times a c
-- du/dy squared.

584
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:47,120
I would really like 1/2 on
that just to make life good.

585
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,580
Then minus a double
integral of f times u.

586
00:40:51,580 --> 00:41:02,860
dx*dy, to emphasize these
are double integrals.

587
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,870
That's a very, very
important problem.

588
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:10,410
Many people have
tried to study that.

589
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:14,980
Euler and Lagrange would
produce an equation for it.

590
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,100
You might say OK, solve
the equation, that

591
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,350
finishes the problem.

592
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:23,890
But mathematicians are always
worried, is there a solution?

593
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,840
Is there a minimum?

594
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,230
So I'm dodging the
bullet on that one.

595
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,490
When I say minimize
over all functions u,

596
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:40,530
I could create problems where
worse and worse and worse

597
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,710
functions got closer
and closer to a minimum

598
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:47,150
and there was no
limiting minimizer.

599
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,610
I won't do that.

600
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,860
This is a problem
that works fine.

601
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,280
What happens to it?

602
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,340
Well, should we try to
do the same weak form?

603
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:07,610
We'd have a dP/du, and what do
you think it would look like?

604
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:12,260
It would have the
integral, double integral.

605
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,650
What would it have?

606
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:21,100
It will have a c*du/dx
and there will be a dv/dx.

607
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,040
But then integration
by parts will

608
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,190
take that x derivative off of
v and onto this, with a minus.

609
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,430
I did it fast, did it way fast.

610
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:43,980
Then out of this thing will
come, if I look at the v term

611
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,760
they'll be a dv/dy and I
take that y derivative off

612
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,290
of that and onto this.

613
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,200
Oh, I can't use d anymore,
I have to use partials.

614
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,910
d by du of c*du/dy.

615
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:05,060
Then the f is just
sitting there.

616
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:17,030
Oh, it's all multiplied by
v. dx/dy I didn't put yet.

617
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:32,770
Equals zero for all v.
Again, this is the same thing

618
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:38,330
that we had in ordinary calculus
where it was just P prime of u,

619
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:39,740
v equals zero.

620
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:49,980
This is a level of
sophistication up.

621
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,820
It's producing
differential equations, not

622
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,480
scalar equations.

623
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,180
So what's the deal?

624
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,060
I've done the
integration by parts,

625
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,000
so I've got everything
multiplying a v.

626
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:15,020
So what's the strong
form of this problem?

627
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:25,550
Well, if this integral has
to be zero for every v,

628
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:30,910
then the conclusion is that this
stuff in the brackets is zero.

629
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,100
That's always the same.

630
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,040
That's the strong form.

631
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,590
So that's Laplace's
equation or actually

632
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:41,970
Poisson's equation because I
have a right-hand side, f of x.

633
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,360
Well, those are the mechanics.

634
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:55,210
Now, what else comes into
the calculus of variations?

635
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,630
You've seen the pattern here.

636
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:01,560
There's one important
further possibility

637
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:07,940
that we met last time,
which was constraints.

638
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,320
We're dealing here with
a pure minimization.

639
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:17,060
I didn't impose
any side conditions

640
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:21,740
on u except maybe the
boundary condition.

641
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:27,910
So let me give you
an example which --

642
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:35,460
I'll just close with an example
that I'm going to follow up,

643
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,340
and it's going to
have a constraint.

644
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:44,960
So it'll look like the
original problem, but, well,

645
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,930
there will be two u's.

646
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,510
So can I try to
get it right here?

647
00:45:53,740 --> 00:46:04,580
My minimization, my unknown
will have two components, u_1

648
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,080
and u_2.

649
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:13,980
And it'll be in 2D actually.

650
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:21,860
What I'm going to produce here
is called the Stokes problem.

651
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,270
I'll study it next time, so if
I run out of time, as I probably

652
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:28,020
will, that's part of the plan.

653
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,710
So it's Stokes and
not Navier-Stokes.

654
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,050
All I want to do is to write
down a problem in which there

655
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,120
is a constraint.

656
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:48,730
So I write it as a minimization,
say, dv_1/ d -- oh,

657
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,830
probably all these
guys are in here.

658
00:46:50,830 --> 00:47:00,990
dv_1/dx and dv_1/dy and
dv_2/dx and dv_2/dy --

659
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,470
sorry about all this stuff.

660
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:13,290
Probably an f_1*v --
oh, I've written v,

661
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:16,150
because my mind is saying
that the usual notation,

662
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:20,050
I should be writing u
because that would fit with

663
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,120
today's lecture.

664
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,400
It's a velocity and that's
why many people call it v,

665
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,450
and then they have to call
the perturbation some w.

666
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:35,240
f_1*u_1, f_2*u_2,
all that stuff.

667
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,960
No problem.

668
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,820
That would lead to Laplace's
equation, just the same,

669
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,440
Poisson's equation.

670
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,140
But I'm going to
add a constraint.

671
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:54,980
This [u 1, u 2] is a
velocity, despite the letter.

672
00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:00,530
I want to make the
material incompressible.

673
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:06,740
I have flow here and
it's like flow of water,

674
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:09,580
probably incompressible.

675
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:24,042
So incompressible means that
dv_1/dx plus dv_2/dx is zero.

676
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:25,000
So that's a constraint.

677
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,550
How the heck do we deal with it?

678
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,870
So I could do this minimization
but with the constraint.

679
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:50,260
So all this stuff I'm
totally cool with now.

680
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,310
That would just be
calculus of variations,

681
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:56,130
that would get me
the dP/du, but I have

682
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,490
to account for the constraint.

683
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:01,230
So how do you account
for a constraint?

684
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:06,790
You build it into the problem
with a Lagrange multiplier.

685
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:11,140
So I multiply this thing by
some Lagrange multiplier,

686
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,360
and as I emphasized last time,
Lagrange multipliers always

687
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,940
turn out to mean
something physically,

688
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,980
and here it's the pressure.

689
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:26,650
So it's natural to call the
Lagrange multiplier p of x, y.

690
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:34,320
I build that in, so I subtract
the Lagrange multiplier

691
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,820
times this thing
that has to be zero.

692
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:42,050
That gets in the problem.

693
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:50,380
Now my function now depends
on u and the pressure.

694
00:49:54,690 --> 00:50:00,420
I'm not going to push
this to the very limit

695
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,520
to find the strong form.

696
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,940
But the strong form is
the Stokes equations

697
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,960
that we'll study.

698
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,960
So we have a lot to
do here to make this

699
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,060
into practical calculations
where we can compute something.

700
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:22,560
And finite elements is
a powerful way to do it.

701
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,570
So we have to turn these
continuous problems

702
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:27,460
into discrete problems.

703
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:32,490
And then, later, we have to
turn this type of problem, which

704
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:35,910
will be a saddle point problem
because it's got this Lagrange

705
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:40,010
multiplier in there,
into a discrete problem.

706
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:45,910
Let me just stop by putting
the words saddle point there,

707
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:52,690
and just as in the lecture
this afternoon, saddle points

708
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:57,190
appear as soon as you have
constraints and Lagrange

709
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:59,320
multipliers.

710
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,750
Well, thanks for your patience.

711
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:05,100
That's a lot of material
that will quickly -- Now,

712
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:11,260
those basic steps will be
section 7.2 and will go up

713
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:18,160
on the web quickly, just as
soon as we get them revised.

714
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,060
And I'm writing notes
on your projects

715
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:25,430
and I hope I'll have
them ready for Friday.

716
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:29,220
I'll aim for Friday because
Monday is Patriot's Day

717
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,160
and you have to
run the marathon.

718
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,440
So I'll see you Friday.

719
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:33,940
Good.

720
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,190
Thanks.
