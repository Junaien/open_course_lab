5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,020
PROFESSOR: OK.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:27,170
Last time, I started to talk
about the heat equation, also

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,830
known as the diffusion equation.

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:36,790
And what we did then
was to solve it.

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,540
Give an analytical solution.

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,180
Both for any initial
value u of x and 0,

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,540
and then, specifically
for the point source.

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,290
So then, we're talking
about the impulse response,

13
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,160
or the fundamental
solution, when

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,960
we start from a delta function.

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,090
And, it was that Gaussian,
bell-shaped curve.

16
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,710
Fantastic fundamental solution.

17
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,270
But the formulas
you get involving

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,700
infinite integrals are not the
greatest for actually getting

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,560
numbers for the
whole temperature

20
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,930
history, u of t and x.

21
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,120
So we have to go to
finite differences.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,600
And, of course, we need
finite differences also

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:38,500
in more general cases, where
non-linear terms could appear.

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:45,260
Or even just variation in x and
t in the linear coefficient,

25
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,360
which I had just set to be 1.

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,520
So, this is the first job.

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,020
Difference methods
for the heat equation.

28
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:02,590
And you'll see that we get
pushed toward implicit methods.

29
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,400
Because explicit method
will require delta t

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,130
to be that very small
size delta x squared,

31
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,130
and that's pretty slow-going.

32
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:22,040
And of course, what I'm
saying applies equally to --

33
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,950
we might be in 2D or in
3D diffusion of pollution,

34
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,850
for example, in
environmental engineering.

35
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,620
Our fundamental solution
from the delta function

36
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,420
would easily extend to
two dimensions or three.

37
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,820
And, our difference
methods will extend,

38
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,650
but we'll see what comes up.

39
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:53,540
And then, let me point to
this second problem which

40
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,360
combines the two.

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,670
We already know
about one-way waves,

42
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,300
coming from a convection term.

43
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,880
Now we're getting the basic
ideas for the diffusion term

44
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,330
and lot of very important,
real problems combine the two.

45
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:20,480
And then you have a
situation that I'm just

46
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,490
sort of pointing to.

47
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,020
Here, that
coefficient, as before,

48
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,400
has the units of velocity.

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,660
Distance over time.

50
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,600
You see, if I
bring time up here,

51
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,880
I have time over distance there.

52
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,600
So I need distance
over time from c.

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,520
It's what we've seen always.

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,950
And, then the c delta t over
delta x, the quantity r,

55
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,050
was dimensionless.

56
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,670
So, I'm taking three minutes
to speak about dimensions.

57
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,890
Dimensional analysis is a
very simple but useful thing

58
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,990
to do at the beginning
of a problem.

59
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:05,290
So here we had r equals c
delta t over delta x, which

60
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,000
is dimensionless.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,490
And, typically for
explicit methods,

62
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,950
it had to be bounded
by 1, for example.

63
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:23,570
Now, for the diffusion term d.

64
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,870
What are the units of d?

65
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,550
Well, here, now I have distance
squared in the denominator,

66
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,070
so d needs to be a
distance squared over time.

67
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:43,870
So it has different dimensions,
and the quantity capital

68
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,050
R that we'll meet,
parallel to this,

69
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:53,890
will be d delta t
over delta x squared.

70
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,790
And, again, it's dimensionless.

71
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,820
Because if d has dimensions
of distance squared over time,

72
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,200
that reverses it to give
dimensionless quantity,

73
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,680
and we'll see that
explicit methods require

74
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,660
a bound on capital R, and
that's what so forces us

75
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,711
into that small time step.

76
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:19,210
OK.

77
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,900
So you'll see capital R playing
a similar role to little r.

78
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,120
And actually,
while we're talking

79
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,510
about dimensional analysis, back
to the differential equation,

80
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,900
suppose we want,
as we certainly do,

81
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,670
to compare the importance
of the convection

82
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,250
term and the diffusion term.

83
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:55,130
Well, that comparison is
somehow the ratio of c to d, So,

84
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,540
somehow, it's natural to
think of the ratio of c

85
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:06,440
to d as telling us a
very important fact.

86
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,570
Is our problem more
like a wave problem?

87
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:20,220
Do we expect to be on the
unit circle, or close,

88
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,620
with a term that in Fourier
space is pure imaginary,

89
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,680
from the i*k?

90
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:35,730
Or, if d is big, we
have then a small ratio,

91
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,870
and that tells us that the
diffusion term is important,

92
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,650
that we've got lots
of dissipation,

93
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,740
that the stability, at least
in the differential equation,

94
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,640
is much greater, because this
is producing a minus k squared

95
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,720
in Fourier space, and a
strongly negative term.

96
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,260
So it's that ratio c to
d but of course, my point

97
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,500
here in the dimensional
stuff is that c to d

98
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,220
isn't quite OK as it is, because
they have different units.

99
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,410
And we need one more distance.

100
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,400
So we need the ratio of c
-- where do I need an L?

101
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,390
I need another L up there.

102
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:30,210
I need another distance
there to get something that

103
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,620
is altogether dimensionless.

104
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,980
And so that's the
critical number.

105
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,930
And, it's a known as
the Peclet Number.

106
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,910
Pe, I'll call it.

107
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,160
What is L?

108
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,740
We're talking here only about
the differential equation. l is

109
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,580
characteristic length.

110
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,110
If our problem is set
on a finite interval,

111
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,430
then it's probably the
length of the interval.

112
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,540
It's a characteristic
length of the problem.

113
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:16,340
And, then this, quantity c*L
over d gives us a good measure

114
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,800
of the importance of these two.

115
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,580
And, we'll see in the
finite difference case,

116
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,870
there will be cell
Peclet number,

117
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,360
which is entirely different.

118
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,740
A Peclet number for the
little finite different cell,

119
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,440
where this L is changed
to like a delta x.

120
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,600
OK.

121
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,640
I think we've got it there.

122
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,470
Have I got the numerator and
denominator correct there,

123
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,760
or should they be reversed?

124
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,500
Is it time over distance?

125
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,410
It is, isn't it?

126
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,510
Time over distance.

127
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,500
That shows that I'm not
a dimensional analyst.

128
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,740
Let me fix it.

129
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,110
And, then that will
mean fixing this.

130
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:22,310
So, let me just fix that.

131
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,220
It doesn't sound right as I
said it, but I read it wrong.

132
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,870
OK.

133
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,770
So c is a time over distance.

134
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,700
Thanks.

135
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,400
Is that right?

136
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
It was right the first time?

137
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,800
In that case, we'll move on.

138
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,270
OK.

139
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,240
All right.

140
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,080
OK.

141
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,070
Good.

142
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,190
Thanks.

143
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,900
Yeah.

144
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,220
You're right.

145
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,800
OK.

146
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,210
Sorry that's on the tapes.

147
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:51,710
OK.

148
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,890
So now let's begin with
a natural explicit method

149
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,620
for the heat equation.

150
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,660
What everybody would think of.

151
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,270
So, this will be explicit
for the heat equations,

152
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,080
and I'm in 1D.

153
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,670
And, what do you think of?

154
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,090
Naturally, forward
difference in time.

155
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,120
So, can I write it this way?

156
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,580
Time difference -- I'll
use capital U, as always,

157
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,650
for the finite difference
solution -- divided by delta x,

158
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:35,510
and I'm doing the heat
equation with c equal to 1.

159
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,270
Just to keep things
simple, let's just

160
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,470
do the heat equation normalized.

161
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,090
So, here I'm going to
take a second difference

162
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:51,950
in the x direction of u
divided by delta x squared.

163
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,130
OK.

164
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,780
What's the accuracy?

165
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,750
Well, we know the
accuracy of each term,

166
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,290
the centered difference, the
error is the discretization

167
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:20,040
error, the local error,
the truncation error,

168
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,620
it's also called, will
be proportional to -- oh,

169
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,420
I'm sorry, that's
delta t of course.

170
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,360
OK.

171
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,010
So, the discretization error
in a forward difference,

172
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:50,400
when I divide by delta t --
so it's first order in t,

173
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,040
and centered difference because
of the symmetry is second order

174
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,540
in x.

175
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,970
OK.

176
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,640
And this would be
another problem

177
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,830
where I could have begun
with a semi-discretization.

178
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,950
I could have begun
with keeping this

179
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:19,450
as a derivative, du/dt, equal
this centered difference,

180
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:25,210
and the discussion would have
been entirely parallel to what

181
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,700
we'll have here.

182
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,560
So, I've jumped right to the
finite difference in x and t.

183
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,110
So, in other words,
what's happening here?

184
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,730
U_(n+1), U at that center
point, n plus 1, of course,

185
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:46,730
our little molecule is computing
this backward difference,

186
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:51,490
and this -- or rather
forward in time,

187
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,310
so this is the time
direction, n plus 1 --

188
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,550
and this centered
difference in space.

189
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:03,580
So if I just write out
what that does, it's u_(j,

190
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,950
n) coming from the
time difference.

191
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,330
Then, I'll multiply by delta t,
and I have a delta x squared,

192
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,390
so that ratio is what I'm
calling capital R. Capital R,

193
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:28,100
to distinguish the diffusion
ratio from the wave ratio.

194
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,170
Times what?

195
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:36,570
So it's just going to be U_(j+1)
at time n minus 2*U_j at time

196
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,480
n, plus U_(j-1) at time n.

197
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,430
We're good at writing
that expression down.

198
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,440
We can follow e to
the i*k*x, of course.

199
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,920
That's always the idea.

200
00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:01,550
Start with U_(j, 0) as
e to the i*k*j delta x,

201
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,990
and follow it up.

202
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:14,200
We're looking for
a growth factor G,

203
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,340
the growth factor
in a single step,

204
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,750
and, of course, the point
is, it depends on k.

205
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,460
At at every step, the
exponential is always with us.

206
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,260
It's the factor that multiplies
that exponential that we want,

207
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,980
and you see what
it is, don't you?

208
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,620
Can you see what G is here?

209
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:47,650
So, if I put in that, and
then ultimately factor out

210
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,290
the exponential, it'll
be multiplied by a 1,

211
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:56,980
from that part, and an R from
this, and now in parentheses,

212
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,995
we have the now very familiar
quantity that comes from e

213
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:09,270
to the i*k delta x, e to
the minus i*k delta x.

214
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:14,650
Those combine to give
2 cosine k delta x,

215
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,590
and the center one is minus 2.

216
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,060
OK.

217
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,690
That's our growth factor.

218
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,180
And the question
is, does it stay

219
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:32,910
below 1, which is the stability
requirement, for all k delta x.

220
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:37,860
And, so you can see the
dangerous frequency as,

221
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:44,030
often, the dangerous frequency
is when k delta x is pi,

222
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,820
and that cosine becomes minus 1.

223
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:59,980
And, then we have -- So,
stability at k delta x equal pi

224
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:06,820
needs -- so this becomes
1 and this is negative 2,

225
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,890
and that's negative 2.

226
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:13,840
We have 1 minus 4R,
and that quantity

227
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,960
has to be, in absolute
value, not exceeding 1.

228
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,800
Well, there's no danger that
it's going to go above 1.

229
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,370
The danger is, will
it go below minus 1,

230
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,070
and it's not allowed to.

231
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,670
So we need it to be greater
than or equal to minus 1.

232
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,910
And, now, if I put the minus
1 on this side and the 4R

233
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,890
on that side, that means 2
is greater or equal to 4R.

234
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:49,690
And, I get the famous condition
R less or equal to half.

235
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,300
That's the stability
requirement.

236
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,880
And if there was a coefficient
d in the heat equation,

237
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,620
the coefficient would
be there in R. OK.

238
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,440
So, that's the
stability condition,

239
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:12,710
and that's the thing we would
like to find a way around,

240
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:17,120
because, it says
that this delta t --

241
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,390
I'll just put that in,
less or equal a half,

242
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:25,120
and that means a
very small delta t.

243
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,910
OK.

244
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,220
What's the way around it?

245
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,220
To go to an explicit method.

246
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,660
So, let me go first to a
completely explicit method.

247
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,680
Fully explicit.

248
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,390
I'm sorry.

249
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,140
To go to an implicit method.

250
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:54,780
Now, implicit method --
now I'm going to do --

251
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,090
switch to an implicit method
by computing this difference

252
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,120
at time n plus 1.

253
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,100
So this is now n plus 1.

254
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,410
And, what's the change in G?

255
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,861
A big change.

256
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:11,360
OK.

257
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:19,960
So now I want to recompute
G, for the growth

258
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,290
factor over a single step
for the exponential, when

259
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,805
the right-hand side,
the second difference

260
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:31,930
is taken at the new time.

261
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:38,130
So this has to move over to
the other side of the equation.

262
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,700
That makes the stability
better, but, of course,

263
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,100
it's going to make the
computation more difficult.

264
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,500
Let me just think about
the stability for now.

265
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,950
So, instead of this board,
this is the explicit case.

266
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:57,781
Yeah.

267
00:18:57,781 --> 00:18:58,656
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

268
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,820
PROFESSOR: So it has to be,
let's draw a little picture

269
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,440
here.

270
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,890
So, there's 0.

271
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,840
There's 1.

272
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,760
And here's minus 1.

273
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,640
And this quantity is starting
at 1, and subtracting 4R.

274
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,280
So, the question is,
does it stop here?

275
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:30,810
If it stops there,
then in this picture,

276
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,060
these would both be negative.

277
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,240
This would be
about minus a half,

278
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,800
but that is greater
than minus 1.

279
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,000
So this would be the OK
case, when this is true.

280
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,820
And that's what required
R less or equal to half.

281
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,470
So in this case, yeah.

282
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:56,780
In that case, R is less than
-- but if R equal to half --

283
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,340
everybody sees this --
if R equaled a half,

284
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,060
this would be 1 minus 2.

285
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,320
This would bring us
all the way here.

286
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,260
And if R is bigger
than a half, then that

287
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:12,450
would reverse that inequality,
and we would be unstable.

288
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:12,950
Yeah.

289
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,130
I think it's OK.

290
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:15,630
Thanks.

291
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,760
It's the difference between
looking at the magnitude --

292
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,830
if I put magnitude, then I
would need less or equal or just

293
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,840
realizing that it's just
taking it as a number.

294
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,501
1 minus 4.

295
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:33,000
OK.

296
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,600
I think that's all right.

297
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,440
Now the implicit case.

298
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,870
What happened to G?

299
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,490
What happened to G?

300
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,820
Let me put it here.

301
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,400
Implicit.

302
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,240
So, what's changed?

303
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,630
This term, which came from
the second difference,

304
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:02,350
is moved over to the n plus
1 side of the equation.

305
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:12,830
So, we have -- in Fourier space,
we would have 1 from the u_(j,

306
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:21,240
n+1), and then minus 2R, and
times our expression 2 cosine k

307
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:31,730
delta x minus 2 -- that's
what multiplies e to the i --

308
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:39,900
do you see that that's
showing up on the new side

309
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,900
of the equation, multiplying
e to the i*k delta x,

310
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:57,280
and on the old side, the old
time step, we only have the 1.

311
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,960
In other words,
the growth factor

312
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,150
is, this goes down
into the denominator,

313
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,810
and we can see what's going on.

314
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,520
So the growth factor is
1 over this expression.

315
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:18,910
1 minus 2R times 2
cosine k delta x minus 2.

316
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,780
We keep running
into that quantity

317
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,670
from the second difference.

318
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,310
OK.

319
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:27,180
So if I look at that,
what's going on?

320
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,005
The key point of
this quantity is

321
00:22:29,005 --> 00:22:35,390
that it's always negative,
or zero, but never positive.

322
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:42,150
Because this term is never
as large as this one.

323
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,240
So it's negative.

324
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,160
And now, I have another
minus sign here,

325
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,380
so I have 1 divided
by 1 plus something.

326
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:56,830
And always, for all k and
all ratios R, it's OK.

327
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,060
Right?

328
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,460
1 over 1 plus
something positive.

329
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,390
And you see that
everything's real.

330
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,610
That's because we're doing
the diffusion equation, where

331
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,970
the wave equation took us,
we had some imaginary part.

332
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,050
Absolutely stable.

333
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,490
Stable for all delta t.

334
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,740
I'll say even for large delta t.

335
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,090
That's good.

336
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:40,970
Of course, we're not going to
take delta t equal to 1000.

337
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,640
Even if stability allowed us,
the accuracy would be hopeless.

338
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,120
It'd be terrible.

339
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:54,430
I can't take a giant time step
and expect to follow the true

340
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:58,330
exponentials for e to the i*k*x.

341
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:05,870
But, I can take a larger step
than this very small delta,

342
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,120
one half delta x squared step.

343
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,060
So this good.

344
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,430
What's the price that we pay?

345
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,660
The price is that at every
time step, we have to solve.

346
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:25,030
This is now on the other side,
so this brings a whole matrix

347
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,720
over.

348
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:33,670
So, this implicit case -- when
I bring this second difference

349
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:41,930
matrix over -- I've
used capital K,

350
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,200
because the second difference
matrix there is probably

351
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,500
the most interesting
difference matrix, I'll say.

352
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,350
One of the most interesting
matrices, period.

353
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,320
It has the minus 2's
on the diagonal and 1's

354
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,430
above the diagonal.

355
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,950
So, actually, with
signs exchanged,

356
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,570
I called it K. So
can I just remember

357
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,210
the meaning of
this matrix K. I'm

358
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,750
going to stay with that
letter because it's

359
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,220
standard in finite elements
for the stiffness matrix.

360
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,480
So, K, by definition, is
the matrix with the 2's

361
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,940
on the diagonal, minus 1's above
the diagonal, and minus 1's

362
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,170
below the diagonal.

363
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,340
And, what size is it?

364
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:46,130
On the whole line, where
we're working for simplicity,

365
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:51,850
I guess K is infinite
in both directions.

366
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,000
2's and minus 1's.

367
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,910
On an interval where we
would really compute,

368
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,240
K would be a finite matrix.

369
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,395
But, the main point is
that this matrix K is minus

370
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:06,480
the second difference matrix.

371
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,900
So that when I bring it
over to this side, which

372
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:20,750
changes that plus to a minus,
I get this equation to solve.

373
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:31,100
The identity, coming from
the 1, plus R, the ratio,

374
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,800
times this matrix K,
multiplies this vector

375
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,900
of all the values at
the new time step,

376
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:45,590
and equals, in this case, all
the values at the old time

377
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,850
step.

378
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:51,370
Because, at the old time step,
I just have the identity.

379
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,860
Are you OK with this?

380
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:58,010
This is the problem that
we actually have to solve.

381
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,430
I mean, the main
point about it is

382
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,910
that we have a linear system.

383
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,440
The u's at the new
time step are coupled.

384
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,430
Coupled by the
second difference.

385
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,830
Coupled by the matrix K,
so we have to deal with it.

386
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:17,200
Well actually, in one
dimension, no problem.

387
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,980
Because in one dimension, K
is just a tri-diagonal matrix,

388
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:29,360
and we can solve
tri-diagonal systems

389
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,930
almost as fast as we could
work with the identity matrix.

390
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:40,820
And actually, what we're
seeing in this ratio

391
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,850
are exactly the eigenvalues
of the inverse matrix.

392
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,910
So, if I use a formula, I would
say U_(n+1) is the inverse

393
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:58,910
matrix times U_n, and the growth
factor is just the eigenvalues.

394
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:02,490
The growth factor G is
simply the eigenvalues

395
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,070
of this inverse matrix.

396
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:12,800
And, notice again, that
all the eigenvalues of K

397
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,350
are greater or equal zero.

398
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,840
It was a positive
definite matrix,

399
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,210
because I switched sign.

400
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,940
And, the effect
of the identity is

401
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,760
to push it a little
more positive.

402
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,730
Here.

403
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:31,550
It's making -- this is
a positive number there.

404
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,460
That's the eigenvalues
of R*K, and then,

405
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,100
I making it a little more
positive with this 1,

406
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:49,910
so we have a problem that is
safely invertible, stable,

407
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,330
and in one dimension,
quite simple.

408
00:28:52,330 --> 00:29:00,900
So in one dimension we're
entirely ready to go implicit.

409
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,570
Let me just, while
I'm thinking about it,

410
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:09,630
recall that we had some other
matrix in the finite matrix

411
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:19,270
case, we had some other matrices
in the very first section

412
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:25,350
of the original notes, which had
different boundary conditions.

413
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:32,110
In other words, if we're
on a finite interval,

414
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:37,560
then this matrix K corresponds
to zero boundary conditions.

415
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,790
Zero temperature at the end.

416
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:43,970
But we might have other
boundary conditions,

417
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,310
like the derivative
of the temperature

418
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,220
is zero at one end,
or the other end.

419
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,450
That would change this matrix in
the first row and the last row

420
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,880
to another nice matrix.

421
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,520
So, we might have not K but
one of the other tri-diagonal

422
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,630
matrices.

423
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,660
But, here's the real point.

424
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,780
What happens in two dimensions?

425
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:18,250
Suppose I include now a u_yy
term in the heat equation,

426
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,470
or three dimensions
with a u_zz term.

427
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,280
What's different?

428
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,260
Well, we can follow
through the stability

429
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,840
test for the explicit
method, and it'll all

430
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,640
have a term from
delta x squared,

431
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,290
and a term from delta y
squared, and a delta z squared.

432
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,940
It'll be even slightly
tighter on delta t.

433
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,740
Or I can follow through
the implicit method, where

434
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,900
now this second difference
in the x direction

435
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,940
appears also with a second
difference in the y direction

436
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,370
and a second different
in the z direction.

437
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,050
So what's happening?

438
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,990
From the matrix
theory point of view,

439
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:08,920
I still have nice matrices with
2's and minus 1's or maybe with

440
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,830
-- I guess what we would have
-- can we just remember what we

441
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,950
would have in the
two-dimensional case.

442
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,150
In the two-dimensional
case, instead of

443
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:24,700
this second difference with
a minus 1, a 2, and a minus 1

444
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,150
in the x direction, we also
have a second difference

445
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:34,260
coming from the u_yy in the y
direction, so another minus 1,

446
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,480
and that 2 moves up to a 4.

447
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,840
So our matrix in the 2D,
two space dimension case,

448
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,520
will have a 4's on the diagonal.

449
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,000
So it grows from this one.

450
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,230
It's called the tensor
product coming out of this.

451
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:59,910
Anyway, it produces this
famous five-point molecule

452
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:04,220
with 4's on the diagonal,
and four minus 1's

453
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,960
going down other diagonals.

454
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,930
And the problem is that
those diagonal are not --

455
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,430
two of the diagonals might
be right next to the main

456
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:19,570
diagonal, but the other
two will be farther away.

457
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,240
Because we can't number
the nodes to keep all

458
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,000
these four numbered adjacently
at all the mesh points.

459
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,510
In other words, we have
a serious matrix problem.

460
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,490
That's my comment.

461
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:38,670
We have a matrix K in 2D.

462
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:41,820
So what I'm speaking
about is this problem.

463
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:49,980
Identity plus R*K(2D) u at the
new time equal u at the old

464
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,810
time.

465
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,370
And K(2D) is by no means so
easy to deal with as K(1D).

466
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,770
It doesn't have a nice
narrow band like this.

467
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,010
The band stretches
further, and we'll

468
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:11,120
see in spades, in then next
part of the course which

469
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,410
is about solving
large linear systems.

470
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,150
So we have a large
system because we've

471
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,560
got lots of mesh points.

472
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,840
We have matrix that
has a wider band,

473
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,850
and so you need new
ideas in solving it.

474
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:36,160
So this problem is what will be
a model -- is the connection,

475
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,000
really, between this
section of the course,

476
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,380
difference methods for
initial-value problems,

477
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,050
and the next section, which is
solving large linear systems.

478
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:53,570
Because this will be a typical
model large linear system.

479
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:59,500
So that's a comment that
for implicit equations,

480
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,130
the price was low in 1D, but
the price is not so low in 2D.

481
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,040
OK.

482
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,210
Now, have we got
any other candidates

483
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,440
between explicit and implicit?

484
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,810
Well, we did, way back,
for ordinary differential

485
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,510
equations, we had
a trapezoidal rule.

486
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,170
And what did that do?

487
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:29,530
That increased the
accuracy by centering it

488
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,190
at time n plus a half.

489
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,810
Do you remember that?

490
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,160
It was half on the
right-hand side;

491
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,830
we used half the
explicit difference

492
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,590
and half of the
implicit difference,

493
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:44,020
so natural to do it again.

494
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,140
It worked then,
and it'll work now.

495
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,570
So this will be the
trapezoidal method.

496
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:57,310
But most people in the
diffusion application

497
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:03,320
name it after these
authors, Crank and Nicolson.

498
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,560
So it's the
Crank-Nicolson method.

499
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,990
It's half the explicit part
plus half the implicit part.

500
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,390
And the order of
accuracy is increased

501
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,420
by centering it this way.

502
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,520
That's the point, of course.

503
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,320
So I guess the point
will be we don't

504
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:33,560
have any extra work compared
to a fully implicit one,

505
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,120
and we get an extra
order of accuracy,

506
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,350
by centering it at a half.

507
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:55,020
So u_(j, n+1) minus u_(j,
n) over delta t is R,

508
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,320
that ratio -- oh sorry.

509
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:07,220
We've got delta t there -- so
will be the second difference

510
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:24,210
at the old time times a half --
it would just take half of that

511
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:29,040
explicit part plus half
of the implicit part --

512
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,830
this is at time n plus
one, over delta x squared.

513
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,050
You would think of that.

514
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,730
Everybody would.

515
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,830
It's just a natural idea.

516
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,820
It increases the accuracy.

517
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,100
It's still implicit.

518
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:50,050
We still have to bring this term
over onto this side when u_(j,

519
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,850
n) moves over onto that side.

520
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,470
And we can look at
the growth factor.

521
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,870
So that's what we have to do.

522
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:04,140
So bring that term over,
and bring delta t up,

523
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,750
so it's delta t divided by
delta x squared and R. OK.

524
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,790
So I've got this term.

525
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,060
The 1.

526
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,840
And when I bring
that term over, it's

527
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,340
a half of what we
brought over before,

528
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:22,790
which was the R, 2 cosine
k delta x minus the 2.

529
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,750
That multiplies G.
And on the right side,

530
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:35,450
we have the 1 from the
u_(j, n) plus the half,

531
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:41,080
times the R times 2
cosine k delta x minus 2.

532
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,720
I'm certainly getting to the
point where I write these

533
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:57,260
expressions down faster without
explicitly writing e to the i*k

534
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,650
delta x and then canceling it.

535
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:05,650
So, G is a ratio again.

536
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:14,480
In the explicit case G
was all in the numerator.

537
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,490
There was no denominator.

538
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:24,480
In the fully implicit case,
g was all denominator,

539
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,460
with just a one
in the numerator.

540
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,250
Now we have G as the ratio.

541
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,660
So I'm going to bring
this down below.

542
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,850
And, G is a ratio.

543
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,360
So it's a fraction
because it's got

544
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,810
an explicit part in the
numerator and an implicit part

545
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:49,690
in the denominator.

546
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,400
And, of course,
the main question

547
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,090
is, when is G less
or equal to one?

548
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,640
Well.

549
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:07,260
Actually it's cool, because
G is simply -- look,

550
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,250
the numerator is one, and
all this stuff is negative.

551
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:15,070
So this is one minus something.

552
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,630
And, what's going down here?

553
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,020
The signs just reverse.

554
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,270
It's one plus something.

555
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,710
And this is a positive
quantity, and this

556
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,450
is the same positive quantity.

557
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,590
So, this is one minus
-- do you see this --

558
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,955
because this is negative, I'll
write it as 1 minus something

559
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,660
-- something positive.

560
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,700
And here, this is minus
and this is negative,

561
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,250
so this is 1 plus
the same thing.

562
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,180
So what's the answer?

563
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,710
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

564
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:57,390
One minus a positive number
over 1 plus that positive number

565
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,390
can't go wrong.

566
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:09,230
So, for all R. OK.

567
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:17,440
In a way, that has to be more
attractive than fully implicit,

568
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,340
because it didn't
take more work,

569
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,400
it wasn't any less stable,
and it was more accurate.

570
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,740
So Crank-Nicolson is
sort of a natural idea

571
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,420
at this level of analysis.

572
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,770
OK.

573
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:39,970
So those are the three
methods to think about.

574
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:49,720
Of course, actual computations
will bring in new questions.

575
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,906
Boundary conditions,
non-linearities,

576
00:40:51,906 --> 00:40:52,530
and everything.

577
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,280
I'm just staying at
this simple level,

578
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,850
where I'm comparing the first
ideas that would occur to us.

579
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,680
OK.

580
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,250
We may want higher accuracy,
all sorts of things.

581
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:12,780
But, we're seeing the contrast
with the wave equation case.

582
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:19,060
But, here we move more
toward the implicit side,

583
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:25,930
and the reward is unconditional
stability, no condition on r,

584
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,100
but the price is
more computation.

585
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,080
OK.

586
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,770
Well, at that same level
of thinking about the most

587
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:41,040
natural methods
that occur to you,

588
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,860
I want to speak now
about the big, big issue

589
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,430
of convection-diffusion.

590
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:52,370
Suppose both types of
problem are with us.

591
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:55,320
So convention-diffusion.

592
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,340
What would you do then?

593
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:11,110
Now, I have both convection and
diffusion in the equation u_t

594
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,650
equals c*u_x plus d*u_xx.

595
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,920
And I guess I want to say
that this is something

596
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,700
that the world has not
come to a decision on.

597
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,720
The computational
world is still debating

598
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,290
what to do with
convection-diffusion.

599
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:43,740
So it's a very appropriate
equation model to experiment

600
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,240
with.

601
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:53,500
Maybe I'll ask you, as the
next, kind of informal homework,

602
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,660
to begin to
experiment with that.

603
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,050
And when I say experiment,
you can think immediately

604
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:07,700
of the methods you
might think of.

605
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,850
The first methods to try.

606
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:12,290
So the first method of
course, will be explicit.

607
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,850
Fully explicit.

608
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,110
What do you expect
to have happen there?

609
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:25,690
Let's just see how the
two different terms

610
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:33,100
each give their little
push towards the stability

611
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,460
requirement.

612
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:44,250
So explicit is going to be
the time difference, forward

613
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:49,970
time difference equals c times--
what shall I choose first

614
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:52,690
for the space difference?

615
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,030
Upwind, maybe?

616
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,330
Upwind in space?

617
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:04,540
So, this is going to
be explicit and upwind.

618
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:09,330
Of course, everybody knows
that refers to the windy term

619
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:13,441
in the equation, the wave term.

620
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:13,940
OK.

621
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:17,510
So, of course, I'll get a
forward difference, then,

622
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:23,150
in the x direction of u
at time n divided delta x,

623
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:27,080
and then I'm going to
do the natural one.

624
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:35,120
A centered second difference at
time n for the diffusion term.

625
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:35,620
OK.

626
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,040
We'll see what
comes out of that.

627
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,510
It's going to involve
not only the ratio,

628
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,900
it will involve both
ratios, naturally.

629
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,890
Little r, as soon as I
multiply up by delta x,

630
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:57,830
I have a little r there,
my wave equation ratio.

631
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,520
And I have a d delta t
over delta x squared,

632
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:06,710
which I'm calling capital R.
That's the diffusion ratio.

633
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,510
And multiplied by
all sorts of stuff.

634
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:15,330
So actually, why don't I write
down what the equation really

635
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,000
is then?

636
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,830
Explicitly, it's u_(j,
n+1) is u_(j, n) --

637
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:27,220
so maybe I should collect
all the terms here.

638
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:33,360
Can I collect the terms
that multiply u_(j+1, n)?

639
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,780
So what's going to
multiply u_(j+1, n)?

640
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,870
Here I have a c
delta t over delta x,

641
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:46,690
I have an r, from this term.

642
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:49,860
And here I have a d.

643
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:50,360
Right?

644
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,760
No.

645
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,260
Sorry.

646
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,100
I have a capital R.
Isn't that right?

647
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,620
When I multiply through by delta
t, I have d delta t over delta

648
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,840
x squared.

649
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,660
I have a capital R that's
going to multiply the --

650
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,690
does that look right?

651
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,900
And then what multiplies the
center guy, the u_(j, n)?

652
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:29,090
Well that's where the time
difference comes over.

653
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:31,480
There's the usual 1.

654
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,760
Then from this difference,
this upwind difference,

655
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,810
there's a minus at
the center term,

656
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:41,110
because it's a
forward difference.

657
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:48,160
So that will be a minus r, and
from this centered difference,

658
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,270
well remember, that that's
a second difference,

659
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:57,660
so there's a coefficient 2 in
the middle term, or minus 2,

660
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:05,170
and when I bring the delta t
up, it's minus 2 capital R.

661
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:10,150
And then, the third one,
whatever this last coefficient

662
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:16,220
is, is multiplying u_(j, n-1),
and now, where does that come?

663
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,010
It doesn't come from
here, it doesn't

664
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,530
come from the
upwind difference, I

665
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:22,490
guess it only comes from there.

666
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:30,220
And it's probably
just R. And I guess

667
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,730
I would check any
formula like that,

668
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:40,000
to be sure that the
coefficients add to 1.

669
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,700
And they do.

670
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,990
And why should they?

671
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,910
Why should those
coefficients add to 1?

672
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:57,940
So that's my little test
that I've got it right.

673
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:04,945
They should add to 1, because
a constant initial -- if u_(j,

674
00:48:04,945 --> 00:48:09,490
0) is a constant, if I'm
starting from a constant

675
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:15,330
function, its x derivatives
would all be zero.

676
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:18,757
If I had u equal constant,
then the x derivatives

677
00:48:18,757 --> 00:48:20,340
would be zero, so
the time derivatives

678
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:24,380
would be zero, so that
constant would stay forever.

679
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,790
And so I would want to
get the same constant out

680
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:31,040
from constants going in.

681
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,480
And so the coefficient
should add to one.

682
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,190
Well.

683
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:45,130
I can see a situation when
I know stability will be OK.

684
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:53,520
Stability can't fail if those
three coefficients are all

685
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,380
positive.

686
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,610
If those three coefficients
are all positive,

687
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:04,760
then my growth factor
can't be larger than 1.

688
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,030
Those coefficients,
they add to 1.

689
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:11,600
So the growth factor
is this times --

690
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,990
should I write it down?

691
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,950
The growth factor
will be this --

692
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,450
so this will be the
growth factor --

693
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:22,760
G will be that number
times e to the i*k delta x,

694
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,530
from shifting over one.

695
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:31,780
It'll be this number times 1,
and it'll be this number times

696
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:37,970
e to the minus i*k delta x,
and my point is just that

697
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,210
the easiest estimate would
say, well this has magnitude 1,

698
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:45,840
that has magnitude 1,
that has magnitude 1.

699
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,560
If I just add up
magnitudes, I'll

700
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,570
get this one, and
this one and this one.

701
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:57,520
And if they're all positive,
they add to 1, I'm safe.

702
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,130
So what's the
stability condition

703
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:04,420
that this simple
argument requires?

704
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,770
Well.

705
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:06,900
That's positive.

706
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,930
That's positive.

707
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:09,440
The danger is this one.

708
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,340
So I guess I would like
that to be positive.

709
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:23,250
So I would want -- I'm certainly
stable if this is positive,

710
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:30,971
which I might as well write as
r plus 2 big R being not larger

711
00:50:30,971 --> 00:50:31,470
than 1.

712
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:41,050
Because if that's true,
I'm taking a combination

713
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:45,030
with positive coefficients
adding to 1, I can't go wrong.

714
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:45,530
OK.

715
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:51,290
And in fact, that's
pretty familiar.

716
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:58,950
It combines the two
conditions we know.

717
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,200
The condition that r
should be less or equal

718
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,840
1, small r, the wave
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy

719
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,300
condition.

720
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,260
And the condition
that capital R should

721
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,010
be less or equal to half
the diffusion condition.

722
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:19,440
Now they're both -- now
I'm forcing them even more

723
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,251
by saying that the sum
has to be less or equal 1.

724
00:51:23,251 --> 00:51:23,750
OK.

725
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:35,600
So let me leave the explicit
upwind at this point,

726
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,270
and ask you what other
method might you want to try?

727
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:43,100
Well, it would be
natural to think

728
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:51,330
of explicit centered,
where you would center this

729
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:54,120
and we could follow
that one through.

730
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,750
I guess I'll do that
next time very quickly,

731
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,340
and the notes will do it.

732
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:05,650
And I'm not sure which of
those two ways is better.

733
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:11,080
Or, you're going
to say go implicit.

734
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,520
And now I'm going to ask, all
right, but what part of it

735
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,890
do you want me to make implicit?

736
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,000
Maybe all I need
to make implicit

737
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,380
is the heat equation part.

738
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:35,310
And I can keep this
explicit perhaps.

739
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:39,810
And I could even think
of splitting the step.

740
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:41,370
This is something
we haven't done.

741
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:46,900
I could think of taking a wave
step and then a diffusion step.

742
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:50,320
Whatever.

743
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,500
Putting them together into
one step, where the diffusion

744
00:52:53,500 --> 00:53:02,210
step is changed to implicit,
because of the great stability

745
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:05,540
that that provides.

746
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,620
OK.

747
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:10,370
I think you're
seeing the reality

748
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:22,190
of scientific computation
even at this fundamental model

749
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:30,130
level of a model with two quite
different physical effects

750
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:37,530
of motion with finite speed,
energy preserving, magnitude

751
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:43,140
of G tending to be right
at 1; and diffusion

752
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:52,510
at infinite speed, giving
us a growth factor that

753
00:53:52,510 --> 00:54:00,605
tends to be real and
below 1, but the price

754
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:05,020
is it pushes us toward
implicit methods.

755
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:10,490
I think that's really -- this
one choice that I've worked

756
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:14,370
through, and the others
that I've mention,

757
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,850
present a real problem.

758
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:22,980
I'll say another word
about this topic next time

759
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:27,390
and then we'll pretty
soon move to non-linear

760
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:35,980
equations and more realistic,
more difficult applications.

761
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:36,670
OK.

762
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:37,920
Thanks.
