7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:21,760
PROFESSOR: So, you see that --
I thought maybe we've got enough

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,740
good examples in theory
where we need some practice.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:34,680
We need some experiments with
some of the finite difference

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,320
methods that we've spoken about.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,160
So I created this homework in
which you would like choose

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,610
one of these that we've done.

13
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,690
Well, actually, number two,
the Schrodinger equation,

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,860
which has that
imaginary i in there,

15
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,800
we haven't spoken
about yet, but you

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,160
could do the kind
of Fourier analysis

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,240
that we've done for
the heat equation.

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,790
But, of course, it's going to
be different because of that i.

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,390
You'll get an e to the minus
i k squared t, I guess.

20
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,610
And that means that's a
number of absolute value

21
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,550
1 instead of a rapidly
decaying coefficient.

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,990
OK, so my idea is to
choose one of those groups,

23
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,300
or a number five, if you want.

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:36,320
And say, by next
Friday, just give me

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,300
some experiment with a code.

26
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,150
In this case, you
could use -- well,

27
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,150
we have four methods and three
of them are already in code,

28
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,590
and you're welcome to
use those or your own.

29
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,050
And I raised
questions last time --

30
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,740
and I'll put this on the website
with a little more detail.

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,880
So just to give you an
idea of what's coming.

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,550
So this is the
problem that we're

33
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,890
in the middle of speaking
about, near the end,

34
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,560
the mixture of
convection and diffusion.

35
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,140
And this is Schrodinger,
which is new.

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,430
This is the advection equation,
or the one-way wave equation,

37
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,750
which we've started with,
and this is what's --

38
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,320
this'll be the subject of
today's lecture and next time.

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:39,100
And the best reference I can
give, as well as the textbook,

40
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:45,440
the applied math book has
significant discussion

41
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,660
of this conservation law.

42
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,320
But also it's very well
presented in the 16.920 lecture

43
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,630
notes that are on
OpenCourseWare,

44
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,070
lectures 11 and 12.

45
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,770
So I'm going to use those
as a guide in this lecture.

46
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:14,730
Anyway, I thought I'd
just put that up as, you

47
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:21,290
know, time to see what various
difference methods will do,

48
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,410
And again, it'll
be on the website.

49
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,760
OK.

50
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,640
Now to say another
word about this one,

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,120
this convection-diffusion
equation.

52
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,970
So, last time I wrote down a
difference equation very much

53
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,260
like that except what
I wrote down last time

54
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,170
was upwinded so that was just j.

55
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,970
Now it's j minus 1.

56
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,920
And the choice
there is not clear.

57
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,140
This gives us higher
accuracy, of course,

58
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,270
for that x difference,
because it's centered at j.

59
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,090
And we still have this
centered, of course.

60
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,740
The second difference
is centered.

61
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,890
So I wrote down here
what the coefficients

62
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:28,170
are of the three old values at j
plus 1, at j, and at j minus 1.

63
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,230
But there is one
important point here.

64
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,530
The price for that
extra accuracy

65
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,650
may possibly be a
negative coefficient.

66
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,310
This could be negative,
or it could be positive.

67
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,840
It depends which
is more important:

68
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,280
the small r, the convection
part, or the big R.

69
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,100
And let me follow up.

70
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,730
So you remember the price.

71
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,410
If we see a negative
coefficient,

72
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:10,610
then we expect some
oscillations to appear.

73
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,870
And actually, they were supposed
to appear in Figure 5.12,

74
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,710
but it hasn't been done yet.

75
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,470
And if you would choose
this one and do Figure 5.12,

76
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,320
I'll be incredibly grateful.

77
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,060
So Figure 5.12 was to show
the evolution from a u naught

78
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,220
for the convection-diffusion.

79
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:38,670
OK, so can I just -- do you see
that in comparing R with r over

80
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,970
2, those are dimensionless
quantities, right?

81
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,760
Can I take another
minute to try?

82
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:53,140
I'm a total amateur at
dimensional analysis.

83
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:59,043
I did always think, however,
that Einstein could have proved

84
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:04,320
-- well, not maybe proved, but
could have conjectured that E

85
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,210
was m c squared, the
most important equation

86
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:13,030
in relativity, just by
checking the dimensions.

87
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,360
I don't know if that
would -- I mean, right?

88
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,410
That would like -- might have
occurred to him to realize that

89
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,940
m c squared has the dimensions,
if we wrote those out,

90
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,810
of energy.

91
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:34,410
I don't know if that put an idea
into the system which produced,

92
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,910
of course, the fact
that -- and, of course,

93
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,690
there would be a
dimensionless constant,

94
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,000
which amazingly happens to be 1.

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,080
OK, so dimensional analysis
could, like, change the world.

96
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,820
This won't quite
change the world,

97
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,040
but a little touch of something.

98
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,750
OK, so can I just -- you
remember that this Peclet

99
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,370
number, and I'll write
his name down again.

100
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,240
P-E-C-L-E-T. The Peclet number.

101
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,890
In the differential
equation, the Peclet number

102
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:20,000
was a ratio, essentially
a ratio, of c to d.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,650
But to get the -- I
think we needed --

104
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,440
was that what we needed?

105
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,810
We needed a length to
make it dimensionless.

106
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,670
c is the coefficient for -- c
over d sort of tells us roughly

107
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,070
the importance of
convection and diffusion,

108
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,470
but there's a length
scale to be included.

109
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:52,080
Now the cell Peclet number,
which I'll just call P,

110
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,427
I'm just going to
take to be r over R

111
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:56,760
because those are dimensionless.

112
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,410
And you see that it's
going to play a part here.

113
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,460
Let me see, I forgot.

114
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:13,420
I think I want r over R. Maybe
I want a 2 just because I would

115
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:19,270
like that to -- I'd like it
to come out simply there.

116
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,380
OK, so I may put in a 2.

117
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,100
So that r would be 2R*p.

118
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,760
Where did that 2 come
from, by the way?

119
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,350
Oh, I guess it came
from there, right?

120
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,940
It came from that minus 1/2.

121
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,440
So probably I want
a 2 there just so

122
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,760
that I have a very
simple decision

123
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:49,170
of whether this coefficient
is positive or negative, yeah.

124
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,580
So let me put in a 2.

125
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,920
OK, so r over 2 is R*P then.

126
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,100
This quantity is R times P,
so this is R minus R times P,

127
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:09,220
or it's R, which we know
is OK, times 1 minus P.

128
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:15,330
In other words, P smaller
than 1, that coefficient --

129
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,370
all the three
coefficients are positive.

130
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,770
It's certainly stable.

131
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,010
Not only stable,
it can't oscillate.

132
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,950
We can't have -- we're taking
a combination of the three old

133
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,550
values and oscillations
can't show up.

134
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,420
OK, so just to
see, what is this?

135
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:40,720
And you remember that r
is c delta t over delta x,

136
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:50,730
and capital R is d delta
t over delta x squared.

137
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,650
So just to complete this,
the delta t's cancel.

138
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,310
One of the delta x cancels.

139
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,360
The other one comes up.

140
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,850
So it's c over d, and then
we have a delta x and a 2.

141
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,300
So that's why it's called
the cell Peclet number,

142
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,680
because it's the cell
size, or in my convention,

143
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:24,040
half the cell size that gives
the length scale and decides

144
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,860
whether P is -- so I'm
just going to write down

145
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,680
the conclusion that
the figure should show.

146
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,400
P smaller than 1.

147
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,780
That means that this
coefficient is also positive.

148
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,380
So that's positive
coefficients, no oscillation.

149
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:58,740
And I think you'll see from
the output that P bigger than 1

150
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,520
produces oscillation
we don't like.

151
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,990
In other words, we really
don't want P larger than 1.

152
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,520
And of course you
could say, well,

153
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,660
look at P. It's got
a delta x in it.

154
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,740
That's not going
to be a big number.

155
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:31,600
And the method will work fine as
delta x and delta t go to zero,

156
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,460
but we're going to do
a finite calculation.

157
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,290
And so we're seeing
for the first time,

158
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,730
like, because we have two terms
that are not dimensionally

159
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:52,780
identical, c and d, that in that
competition between convection

160
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,890
and diffusion, the
length scale is crucial,

161
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,590
and the mesh size is crucial.

162
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,510
So I guess the answer
is we can resolve it

163
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,060
by taking delta x small
enough, and hopefully,

164
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,090
that's not a problem.

165
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:18,380
But, of course, you know that
there are many physical cases

166
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:24,050
in which the diffusion
coefficient or the viscosity

167
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,230
coefficient is small,
is quite small.

168
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,700
And so getting that
below 1 might be hard,

169
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,200
because this d could
be a very small number.

170
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:43,740
OK, so maybe -- can I
also mention on the --

171
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,580
as something that we
haven't done here,

172
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:57,210
was to move the second
derivative, this guy,

173
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:03,390
to time n plus 1,
make it implicit.

174
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,540
In the diffusion part,
one often does that.

175
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,320
The diffusion is
the term, is the one

176
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:19,210
that's forcing us to
take this coefficient R

177
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,160
below a half, delta
t of order delta

178
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,630
x squared, and the
way to avoid that is

179
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,670
to move the viscosity
term, at least half of it,

180
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,320
up to the new time.

181
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,690
OK, so that's a third method.

182
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:44,820
So we've done upwind last
time, centered, explicit

183
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,360
this time, but then
that's a third one that

184
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,690
has to be looked at.

185
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:58,920
OK, so that's where we
stand on linear problems.

186
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:10,310
I'm sort of ready to
jump into nonlinear ones,

187
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,830
recognizing that -- well,
there's always more to say

188
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,920
about linear ones.

189
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,900
What are some of the things that
we have not properly discussed?

190
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,170
Boundary conditions, above all.

191
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:31,920
Boundary conditions, and we
could do something with those,

192
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,330
and the notes will say more
about boundary conditions.

193
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,580
So there are several types
of boundary conditions.

194
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,400
I guess I'm going to say
something about them now,

195
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,650
but this'll be a board that
kind of gets covered up.

196
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:51,050
So boundary conditions: So
what are the different types?

197
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,220
Well, at a real
physical boundary,

198
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,600
we might have u equals 0.

199
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:05,520
Say, in heat flow, we
might hold the boundary --

200
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,340
it might be the edge of
a freezer or something --

201
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:14,030
we might hold the temperature
at zero, or at some given value.

202
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,300
We might prescribe
u at a boundary.

203
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,450
Or we might prescribe
the derivative.

204
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,460
And just in case we're
in several dimensions,

205
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,380
I'd better write it as
the outgoing derivative.

206
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,090
It could be prescribed, say, 0.

207
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,440
So what are those two types
of boundary conditions called?

208
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,920
One's called absorbing,
an absorbing boundary,

209
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,810
and the other is an
insulated boundary

210
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,450
where no heat goes through.

211
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,390
To maintain this, heat
probably does go through.

212
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,450
If our body is warm
and we're holding it

213
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:59,590
at zero on its boundary, then
heat is going to travel out.

214
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,660
And in fact, as time
goes to infinity,

215
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:07,910
we're going to approach
cold -- a uniformly cold.

216
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,420
Here, heat's not
allowed to travel out,

217
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,880
so what will happen
as time goes on

218
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,590
is it will approach a constant.

219
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,800
The temperature will approach a
constant because it can't leave

220
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,570
and it diffuses.

221
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:33,160
And now I wanted to
mention a third type

222
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,420
of boundary, which is a
purely computational boundary.

223
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,730
We talked last time
about Maxwell's equations

224
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,570
in free space, and
the big application

225
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,120
of Maxwell's equations, or one
of the big ones historically,

226
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,860
has been to, like, the
exterior of an airplane,

227
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,290
to radar, or other
electromagnetic signals.

228
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,690
So what do we do if we
have an exterior problem?

229
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,940
See, here, I was always thinking
about an interior problem.

230
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,300
You know, we're inside
0 to L or something.

231
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:15,320
But now, what do we do if
a region is the outside,

232
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,330
it's free space all the way?

233
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:22,980
Well, we have to create a
computational box of some sort.

234
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,510
So we create a box
in which we compute,

235
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,960
but the boundaries of this
box, the x-boundaries of it,

236
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,910
are purely artificial.

237
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,960
They're just because we
can't compute to infinity.

238
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:46,630
So waves travel in this box,
and they travel to the --

239
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,250
so you see what I mean?

240
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,450
We're solving it in all this
space, except that's too much,

241
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,800
so that's meant to be a very
large box, not a small one,

242
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,690
as large as we can afford.

243
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:06,780
But waves are still going to
hit the boundary of that box.

244
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,480
OK, what do we choose as
boundary condition there?

245
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,650
We don't want it to reflect
back because it's not

246
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,160
a real boundary.

247
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,650
So we have to create -- I'll
put ABC for absorbing boundary

248
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,710
condition.

249
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,090
Absorbing.

250
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,240
That A is for an absorbing
boundary condition.

251
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,670
And the creation of
these boundary conditions

252
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:44,310
is an important topic
within finite differences.

253
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:50,350
For Maxwell's
equations, a good idea

254
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,370
was produced and
keeps being developed,

255
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,050
called perfectly matched layer.

256
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,720
The idea in that
perfectly matched layer --

257
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:06,100
let me just write PML -- and
I haven't seen this so much

258
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,150
in other application areas.

259
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,630
The idea of this
perfectly matched layer

260
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:19,020
is to create an artificial
dielectric, I guess,

261
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,520
a dielectric medium it would
be, in the electromagnetic case.

262
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:31,840
An artificial thin layer, which
has just the right properties

263
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,240
to stop the wave and swallow it.

264
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:44,140
OK, I'll put on the
website references to that.

265
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:52,530
It's a bright idea,
but not totally simple,

266
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:56,710
and when we change difference
methods, then that perfectly

267
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,250
matched layer has to go with it.

268
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,640
OK, that's the
end of my thoughts

269
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,060
about linear problems for now.

270
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:14,020
We're coming back, of course,
in a few weeks to solving

271
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:19,270
large systems, large linear
systems, the kind that we would

272
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,820
meet if we use an
implicit method,

273
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,310
or the kind that
we meet if we're

274
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,050
solving a steady-state problem.

275
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:33,660
But for now, let me go
to that model equation.

276
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,780
And you see, right
away, the difference

277
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:45,060
between that equation and
the advection equation that

278
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,700
had a constant velocity.

279
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:56,360
Here we have of a velocity that
-- so c is minus u, I guess.

280
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,330
c is minus -- think of c -- this
u as being comparable to minus

281
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,340
c.

282
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,340
So, in other words,
if u is positive,

283
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,060
I'm now going to have
waves going to the right.

284
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,600
So let me just put this
down. u greater than 0

285
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:24,830
will mean waves going to
increasing x, to the right.

286
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:32,280
And the idea will be -- so we
have to discuss that problem.

287
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,320
And as always, we would like
to solve it analytically.

288
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,500
Find whatever formulas we can,
understand what's happening

289
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,080
in terms of these
characteristic lines, because --

290
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,520
when we have one equation
and one space variable,

291
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:59,000
we really can catch the
essence of the solution

292
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,400
by understanding the
characteristic lines.

293
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,760
And then how do we
do it numerically?

294
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:14,850
OK, before class, I wrote just
a few equivalent forms of it.

295
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,470
This is an equivalent form,
and this is, so to speak,

296
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,280
the right form.

297
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,780
This is the form where we
see a time derivative of u,

298
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:33,590
as always, and we see a space
derivative of u squared over 2,

299
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,800
which, of course, produces that.

300
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:41,780
But somehow this is the quantity
-- it's called the flux --

301
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:47,180
that's physically
meaningful, f of u.

302
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,400
So I've chosen a simple flux
function, u squared over 2.

303
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:00,270
So that's the
differential equation.

304
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:08,580
But you'll see that the
differential equation can

305
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,170
produce two solutions
at the same point,

306
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,670
and we have to choose.

307
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,810
In other words,
the differential --

308
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,220
the solution can
become discontinuous.

309
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:29,350
A perfectly smooth starting
function, after a while --

310
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,760
this is the essence
of the problem now.

311
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,670
I might have a smooth starting
function, at least continuous.

312
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:46,050
The solution is constant
along characteristic lines.

313
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,310
But what happens if two
characteristic lines

314
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,830
run into each other?

315
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,750
I've drawn that
possibility here.

316
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:02,020
And it'll take a little time to
see exactly what's happening,

317
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,570
but the characteristics
we can see here.

318
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,660
So the starting values
were 1 up to that point.

319
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:16,810
So when the starting
value is 1 and u

320
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:22,380
is constant along characteristic
lines, then u is 1,

321
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:27,540
and those lines, it's just
like having c equal to minus 1,

322
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,720
I guess, in the
one-way wave equation.

323
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,920
We have a one-way wave
going to the right

324
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,160
now along characteristic lines.

325
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:47,990
So u is 1 in this part
of the xt-plane, right?

326
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,960
We have to come
back to the formulas

327
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,990
to confirm what I just said.

328
00:24:53,990 --> 00:25:02,670
And then, over here on the far
right, the starting value is 0,

329
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:09,680
and the characteristics
in that case,

330
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:15,240
the c associated with that
is 0, so it's a standing --

331
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,300
it's not moving.

332
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,084
The characteristics
are just straight lines

333
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:21,000
in the time direction.

334
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,180
Nothing's happening, right?

335
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,650
When you think of a
characteristic that's

336
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:30,410
going straight up, it's
just carrying the value of u

337
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,490
without moving left or
right, so u stays 0.

338
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,280
So u will be 1 here,
u will be 0 here,

339
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,240
and now something's
happening in here,

340
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,740
and we have to figure
out what it is.

341
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,740
But maybe I can anticipate the
main point before any algebra.

342
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,350
The characteristic
lines in this region

343
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:01,450
have a slope somewhere between
the slope 1 and the slope 0.

344
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,740
You see, we're starting
-- let me graph u_0 of x.

345
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:19,500
So let me graph. u_0 of x is
-- the key points are 0 and 1,

346
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,930
0 and 1.

347
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:33,500
So u_0 of x, I start with a
constant initial function,

348
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,750
a constant profile to the left
of 0, and a constant profile

349
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:43,100
to the right of 1,
and linear between.

350
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,990
OK, so it's that starting
values that I wrote here:

351
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:52,040
1, 1 minus x, and 0
are these three pieces.

352
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,790
And then here I'm
in the xt-plane

353
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:59,390
where here I'm in the xu-plane.

354
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:04,910
So I drew characteristics,
and we still have to track --

355
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,560
we have to say more
what characteristics are

356
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,210
and understand that these
have slopes in between,

357
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,270
but you're not surprised because
the values of u are in between

358
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,630
1 and 0.

359
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:22,160
So they go that way
and they meet here.

360
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,670
So up to time t equal
1, characteristics

361
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,250
tell everything.

362
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,370
Up to t equal 1,
I know that u will

363
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,946
be 1 along these
characteristics,

364
00:27:30,946 --> 00:27:33,730
and when I find these
characteristics,

365
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,030
u is whatever it starts at.

366
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,870
And u is 0 up all of
these characteristics,

367
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,850
so up to that time,
the algebra --

368
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,880
the differential equation
is going to be totally OK.

369
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,830
But after that time, the
differential equation

370
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,380
is in difficulty.

371
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:05,130
Because at that moment t -- so
what's happening as t increases

372
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,280
from 0 to 1?

373
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,430
This is the picture
at t equals 0.

374
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:14,900
The picture at t equal to 1
-- t equal to half, let's say.

375
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,030
What would be the picture
at t equal to half?

376
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:21,380
Well, at t equal to
half, this state 1,

377
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:28,940
has penetrated
this far, halfway.

378
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:34,190
Then, in here is this
converging characteristic that

379
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,150
come from a linear profile.

380
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,870
And over here, it's all zeros.

381
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,180
So that zero is still there,
but -- you see what's happening?

382
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:50,210
This guy is -- the
profile is steepening.

383
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,620
This is at t equal to half.

384
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:55,840
Steeper.

385
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,950
We still have the
algebra to do, but I

386
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:08,360
think the first thing is to
see roughly what's happening.

387
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:14,030
Then at t equal to 1,
this is totally steep.

388
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:19,470
So this is the situation
at t equal to 1.

389
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:24,650
And I could've given you that
as the initial condition,

390
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:30,360
but I and the 16.920
notes, thought, OK,

391
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,090
let's have a little
peace for awhile,

392
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,360
see what those
characteristics are doing when

393
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,010
they're converging, but
they're not crossing.

394
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:48,460
The trouble is, after t equal
to 1, they are crossing.

395
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:57,950
And now, what's the solution
in this crosshatched region?

396
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,820
Do I take the value
of 0 that's coming up

397
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,700
along these characteristics?

398
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,730
Do I take the value
1 that's coming

399
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,520
along these characteristics?

400
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,270
What's happening in here?

401
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,360
So there's a crosshatched
region there,

402
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:21,850
which is a big question
mark because my rule

403
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,640
of following characteristics
has led me to two answers.

404
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:39,030
And we want a physically
relevant answer.

405
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,660
We're sort of
expecting, and we'll

406
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:51,840
see, that this step
function is a step function.

407
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,190
I mean, the answer will
be a step function.

408
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:03,220
It will be 1 and then
drop to 0 along some path

409
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,150
in the xt-plane, which
is not a characteristic.

410
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:13,600
The characteristics are going
at 45 degrees and at 90 degrees.

411
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,520
And actually, so this is the
region I'm interested in.

412
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,750
So can I blow up that region?

413
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:26,010
So if I blow up that region,
that's where the shocks --

414
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:30,620
the shocks are meeting
everywhere in this region.

415
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,010
This was the point --
what was that point?

416
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:38,650
I guess that was the point
x equals 0 and t equal to 1,

417
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,690
there.

418
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:44,450
OK, and the question is -- and
I know that I have u equals 0

419
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:48,210
over here, and I know --
oops, u equal 1 over here,

420
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,070
and I know that I
have u equal 0 here,

421
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,600
but the question is
where, and -- well,

422
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,650
what happens in between?

423
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:07,920
You can think of at least
two possible scenarios,

424
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:15,450
and one of those is that
there's a shock line that goes,

425
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,610
let's say, somewhere
in the middle.

426
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:23,390
And so u stays 1 all
the way to that line

427
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,290
and drops to 0 after it.

428
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:35,240
In other words, this wall of
water travels to the right.

429
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:41,120
The shock, the
discontinuity, moves along,

430
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,920
not necessarily at the
speed that this one --

431
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:50,180
this would be moving along the
speed of 1, with this pushing.

432
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,410
Not stationary either, which
is what this right side would

433
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,440
like, but somewhere between.

434
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,650
So that's a shock line.

435
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,880
I'll just, for short,
call it a shock.

436
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,870
Then there's
another possibility.

437
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,680
And that will happen
in this case, actually.

438
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,540
That will happen in this case.

439
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,980
But there is another
possibility that

440
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,860
will happen in other
cases, and that would

441
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:26,170
be a fan of characteristics.

442
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,310
Let me see that when it comes,
but I'm just mentioning it

443
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,540
to say that this business
of the shock line,

444
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,990
which is what we'll
pursue now, which --

445
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,540
because it's what happens
with this problem --

446
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:47,240
is not the only -- is not
always the way to match,

447
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:55,350
the way to deal with a problem
of lack of information coming

448
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,610
from the characteristics.

449
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:05,870
OK, so I guess our question
is, what is that shock line?

450
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,730
What's the path?

451
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:13,500
What's the slope,
and what controls it?

452
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,720
And the answer will be
that what controls --

453
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,140
we run into problems with
the differential equations.

454
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:28,430
And the way to see what
continues to happen

455
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:31,900
is to go to the integrated
form, the integral form

456
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:37,470
of the equation, where, of
course, by taking an integral,

457
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:41,220
I make everything
smoother, and also I

458
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,770
preserve the physical
law, the conservation law.

459
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,360
So this is really
the conservation law.

460
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,330
What is this?

461
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,620
Well, let's first of all
see where it comes from.

462
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:02,970
It just comes from integrating
this equation with respect

463
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,210
to x.

464
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,980
So I have a time derivative
that I keep out here,

465
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,780
but my space derivative is
going to disappear because I'm

466
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,240
integrating with respect to x.

467
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:18,075
So I can call d by dt or partial
d by dt the integral of u with

468
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:21,310
respect to x, and I'm
integrating from somewhere --

469
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,040
from some point to
some other point.

470
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,440
Instead of a and b, I'll call
them -- I really should --

471
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,740
I'm sorry, I should say x on
the left and x on the right.

472
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:40,800
Some point x at the left and
some point x at the right.

473
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,370
And now I've
integrated this one.

474
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:50,870
I've called -- this is f of u
so I'm now thinking of any flux

475
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,520
function.

476
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,870
And the integral,
of course, gives me

477
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:59,130
f of u at the upper end minus
f of u at the lower end.

478
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,880
OK, so that's the
conservation law.

479
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,900
Let me write that word down.

480
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,310
This is the conservation law.

481
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,300
What is it saying?

482
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:20,630
It's saying that the change in
the quantity in the integral is

483
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,820
given by -- if there's any
change, any time derivative,

484
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,710
the rate of change
in the interval --

485
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:33,950
it's the conservation
of this integral,

486
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:42,480
meaning that any change in that
integral happens because there

487
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,990
is flow going out the
right-hand side of the interval

488
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,220
or there's flow coming in the
left side of the interval.

489
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,990
So that's why we have a
minus sign between them.

490
00:36:53,990 --> 00:37:02,550
So that's a statement of
conservation, and -- oh,

491
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,350
there's one more example
that I'll mention now.

492
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,840
Let me give this
particular equation a name,

493
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,040
just because you see it.

494
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,130
You often see it written --
called Burger's equation.

495
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:32,650
But actually, the full name
is the inviscid, no viscosity,

496
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,550
Burgers' equation
because it's a 0.

497
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:41,280
So just one word about
Burger's equation.

498
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,090
So Burger allowed
a u_xx term here.

499
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:52,150
So he had one of our
-- nonlinear convection

500
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:59,710
and a diffusion term, and his
convection was this simple

501
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,590
expression u*u_x.

502
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:05,450
It's the kind of thing you see
in the Navier-Stokes equations,

503
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,000
right?

504
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,430
The nonlinearity
in Navier-Stokes

505
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,760
is sort of in this term,
of this general sort,

506
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,330
but this is a major
simplification.

507
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:19,545
Such a simplification
that Burger could solve,

508
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:21,170
even though the
equation was nonlinear.

509
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,140
Well, two people,
at the same time,

510
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,240
discovered the
change of variable,

511
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,730
a simple little trick.

512
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,420
Hopf and Cole.

513
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,430
I'll put their names
down because they

514
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:41,520
had nice, short last names.

515
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,370
They both discovered -- in
the case of a diffusion term,

516
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:49,660
they both discovered a little --
a change of variables that made

517
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,130
the equation linear.

518
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,870
Then they could
solve the equation.

519
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:58,440
That's in the textbook in the
section on conservation laws.

520
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,660
And then the important
thing that Burger could do

521
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:07,380
was let the diffusion
coefficient go to zero.

522
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,050
So then in the limit, he got
the inviscid Burger's equation,

523
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,950
the one we're looking at.

524
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,950
And he could look
at the solution

525
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,480
and let the limit go to zero.

526
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:24,580
And that's another way to figure
out what's the right solution.

527
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,900
That's the viscosity method,
a fundamental method,

528
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:34,340
for finding out when we
run into a problem, shocks

529
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,350
run into each other.

530
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:39,940
We don't know what to choose.

531
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,830
One way to find out,
in this 1D problem

532
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:50,300
and also in much tougher
nonlinear multidimensional

533
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,990
problems, is put a
little viscosity in,

534
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,230
and let it be small.

535
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,650
Let it even get smaller.

536
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:07,030
Then -- with a little viscosity,
officially this term --

537
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:13,150
in some sense, this term,
because it's a second

538
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,440
derivative, is officially,
mathematically speaking,

539
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:25,150
sort of dominates this
one as far as -- I mean,

540
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,320
this will produce
a smooth solution.

541
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,610
This term, as we know
doesn't smooth the solution.

542
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:37,270
It just advects it,
just carries it along.

543
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,780
But this term will smooth it.

544
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,880
So this is the dominant
term, the second derivative.

545
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,790
No surprise.

546
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,880
So when we introduce that,
that smooths everything.

547
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:59,380
We have no problem to say
there is a solution, at least

548
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:05,890
for simpler models,
and then we can

549
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:09,740
see what happens when
that term approaches zero.

550
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,340
OK, so that's another method.

551
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,540
And, of course, that's
kind of what we're

552
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,710
doing with finite differences.

553
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:20,120
Finite differences, if we
put in a little viscosity,

554
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,500
a little second-space
difference,

555
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,730
and take delta t small
enough for stability,

556
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,140
then we can solve it.

557
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:35,970
And if we take it very small,
we should get something close

558
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,660
to the inviscid limit.

559
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:42,070
OK, I was just
giving Burger's name

560
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:44,970
to that particular example.

561
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:49,210
So this isn't the only example,
but it's the simplest example.

562
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:55,010
OK, another example
of conservation laws

563
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:00,640
that everybody likes, I
think, is the traffic flow,

564
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,000
traffic flow in one
direction, say, on the Mass.

565
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,250
Pike.

566
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,470
So what's the equation
of traffic flow?

567
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:11,250
Let me put that on a
board here, and then I

568
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,300
have to come back to this.

569
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,370
Well, I'll put it here.

570
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:21,060
So Example 2 -- well, I don't
know if you can call that

571
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,810
Example 1.

572
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,150
We didn't give it
a physical meaning.

573
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:35,080
Example 2 will be traffic flow
in 1D, and what's the unknown?

574
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,790
Well, it's the thing
I've been calling u,

575
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:48,200
but for traffic flow,
the natural unknown

576
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,430
is the density of the traffic,
the density of the cars.

577
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,100
And everybody uses
rho for density.

578
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,510
So can I use rho rather than u?

579
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:16,580
And then, in the
equation will be a car --

580
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:23,470
a velocity that I'll call
v. That's not a new unknown.

581
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,860
In fact, the velocity
experimentally depends -- oh,

582
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,230
there's a relation.

583
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:39,610
The density and velocity
are, by experiments,

584
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,430
if you run an
experiment on the Mass.

585
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:45,500
Pike in heavy traffic -- that
could be a homework problem,

586
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:52,390
too -- to find the
relation between v and rho.

587
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,660
So I'm going to keep
this rho as the unknown

588
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:02,970
and imagine that we have some
experimental velocity v of rho.

589
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,390
And what would we expect?

590
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:12,890
I guess we expect that
as rho increases --

591
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,600
as the density increases,
what will happen?

592
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,680
As the density increases, the
traffic is going to slow down,

593
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:26,830
ultimately come to a stop, where
if the density is very small,

594
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:33,370
so the density 0 -- I mean,
we just have a single driver,

595
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:40,020
the police are not out, so
he's going v_max or 2*v_max.

596
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:51,950
But as the road gets
crowded, the velocity

597
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,830
drops and maybe drops linearly.

598
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:06,990
That would be a possible
and not that terrible

599
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,440
relation between v and rho.

600
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,421
So what would be the flux
function in this traffic flow

601
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:12,920
problem?

602
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:20,200
The conservation law is like
conservation of cars, right?

603
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:30,730
If we look at a unit, a
piece of the turnpike, then

604
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,590
the conservation law says
that the total number

605
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:43,060
of cars inside, which is
this, changes by cars leaving

606
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:47,280
and by cars entering.

607
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,480
And so the flux function
I think will be --

608
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,450
so we have to know like sort
of how many cars are leaving,

609
00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:01,970
and I think the flux function
would be probably v times rho.

610
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:09,200
I think the flux function of
-- rho, now, is my unknown --

611
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,620
I think would be v
of rho times rho,

612
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,370
the velocity times the density.

613
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:18,400
That tells me how many
cars are going out.

614
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:25,080
OK, so I guess what I want to
say is that we will meet --

615
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,200
that we meet, in this
traffic flow example,

616
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:35,040
exactly these
possibilities that --

617
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,020
we meet them mathematically just
the way we meet them in actual

618
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:45,190
driving -- of a shock.

619
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:50,020
So this shock corresponds
to -- so what that's?

620
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:56,940
Like stop-go -- this
corresponds to, I suppose,

621
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,200
like meeting a red light?

622
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:06,470
Coming up to a red light, the
traffic you're behind normally

623
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:07,420
stops.

624
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:12,290
It has to slow
way down and stop.

625
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:16,000
Then the light turns green.

626
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,690
The first car takes off.

627
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:21,600
The cars begin to spread out.

628
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:30,410
That's the solution
that I don't see

629
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:35,330
with this starting function,
a sort of fan of cars.

630
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:40,240
So maybe I could write those
words down: shock or a fan.

631
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:49,090
The shock is what happens when
characteristics come together,

632
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:51,110
cars come together.

633
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:56,840
The fan is when the
characteristics fan out.

634
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:02,140
Actually, I could illustrate
a fan here right away.

635
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:11,650
Suppose I reverse 0 and
1 just to see what -- OK,

636
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:17,460
so here's my --
this is my x again.

637
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:26,730
So here I'm going to have u_0
to be 0 now, u_0 to be -- well,

638
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:30,520
I can even -- it's called a
Riemann problem when there are

639
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,620
just two values here.

640
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,230
u_0 is 1.

641
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:41,660
So the so-called Riemann
problem is the cleanest example

642
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:45,760
of the whole
conservation law theory

643
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,340
when there are just two starting
values, 0 and 1, or 1 and 0.

644
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,170
And it makes a big difference.

645
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:57,740
1 and 0, we saw when we reached
time 1, we had a 1 and a 0,

646
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,100
and after that, a shock formed.

647
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,870
Here 0 and 1, the
characteristics

648
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:05,840
here are going as always.

649
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,230
So u is 1 here.

650
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:12,670
The characteristics here,
this is staying at 0.

651
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,920
There's no reason to change.

652
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:22,920
But here we have now a region,
just like the other one,

653
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,870
but with a major difference.

654
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:27,580
That now, it's 0
on the left and 1

655
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,500
on the right, where before,
it was 1 on the left

656
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,220
and 0 on the right.

657
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,300
And the question is,
what happens in here?

658
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:41,180
Well, you might think
a shock, a step up

659
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,780
from 0 to 1 at some point.

660
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:51,540
And I would have to agree that
you could do that in such a way

661
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:55,160
that you maintained
the conservation law.

662
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,860
But that's not what happens.

663
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,470
This is going to
be a fan in here.

664
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,940
We're going to have -- what
we'll have is characteristics

665
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,790
in here.

666
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:14,300
This will -- let me
draw the profile.

667
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:21,000
So the profile is 0
there to 0 at some time.

668
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,580
Then over here, where this
characteristic is met, it's 1,

669
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:34,310
and this is what
happens: Instead

670
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:37,680
of getting worse, less
smooth, the solution

671
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,930
gets better, more smooth, when
the direction is reversed.

672
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:45,220
So we see that our problem
had to be nonlinear.

673
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:50,010
A linear problem couldn't
do these two opposite things

674
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:53,110
in the same thing.

675
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:57,630
So here we would have a fan and
the characteristics go there,

676
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,730
and it's reflected there.

677
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:04,660
OK, so there's a picture of the
phenomena that we're looking at

678
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:09,590
and we would like to
see numerically, too.

679
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:16,720
So next time I want to find --
so I can say now what I have

680
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,250
to do next time.

681
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:27,800
One is to locate the shock, the
shock line, when there is one,

682
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:36,240
and two, to decide -- how do
we decide between shock or fan

683
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:44,150
when from the point of
view of pure conservation,

684
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:46,400
we could choose.

685
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,290
But nature makes a choice.

686
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:52,000
And one way to decide,
make that decision,

687
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,170
is Burger's way of putting
in a little diffusion

688
00:51:55,170 --> 00:52:01,280
and letting it disappear,
but we need a direct rule.

689
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,190
So we need a direct
entropy condition.

690
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:09,700
So this is going to
be a shock speed --

691
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:14,280
a formula for shock speed s
-- s equals shock speed --

692
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,260
we'll find, if there is a shock.

693
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,360
And number two is going to be
-- this decision is going to be

694
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:26,610
based on a quantity
called entropy,

695
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:30,020
which appears only in
nonlinear problems, really.

696
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:36,620
OK, so that's a
beginning picture,

697
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:46,180
which these 16.920 notes
are an excellent reference

698
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,800
for, the book also.

699
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,090
And Monday's lecture
will pick up there.

700
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:56,570
So we can see the
two situations here,

701
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:01,420
and the question is what
do we do at this point.

702
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,820
OK, see you Monday.

703
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,710
Have a good weekend.

704
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:08,800
And any email questions
about the homework,

705
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,460
just you could send to me or --
and/or to -- maybe and to Mr.

706
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:17,590
Cho, who will be looking at
the homeworks that come in.

707
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:19,310
Good, thanks.
