6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,850
PROFESSOR: So this
is the equation

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,560
that we-- this inviscid
Burgers' equation, no viscosity,

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,110
is the one we've learned
about for-- shocks appear,

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:35,750
fans can appear and
I want to do more

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,830
today with exact solutions.

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,400
So today is a little
bit more analysis

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,160
than numerical solutions.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,600
So while doing
something, sort of PDE

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,170
rather than numerical
PDE, well, it's

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,190
natural to include Burgers'
equation with viscosity.

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,580
So that's got the
extra term there.

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,490
And if I can, I would
like to say something

18
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:06,270
about two other important
equations, nonlinear.

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,040
One has a third derivative
on the right-hand side,

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,430
so it's a dispersion
rather than a diffusion.

21
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,840
And that equation is named
after Korteweg-de Vries,

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,040
KdV it's often called.

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,100
I'll just put that down;
KdV is the shorthand

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,430
for that equation.

25
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,400
And it comes up in water
waves, one-way water waves

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,890
actually, along a
shallow channel.

27
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,220
It was actually seen by somebody
riding along next to the wave

28
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,100
and the wave kept its shape.

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,550
And so this equation
has had a period

30
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,320
of great fame in some way.

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,020
It's nonlinear of
course, but it was

32
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,760
discovered that there was a
really clever way to solve it.

33
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,980
Actually, we will
solve these equations

34
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,500
even though they're nonlinear,
that won't be too hard.

35
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,200
The clever ideas that went
into solving that one,

36
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,870
I can describe a little
bit, but not in full detail.

37
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,930
And then we'll connect also to
Hamilton-Jacobi type equations,

38
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,830
which are very closely related
to this in one dimension

39
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,940
and in fact, they'll
come into it.

40
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,970
OK, so those are the
equations and then, next time,

41
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,320
will come a little more
about finite differences

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,570
for those equations and a
lot more about the level set

43
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,560
method, which is more
connected to Hamilton-Jacobi

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,020
and is quite a remarkable idea.

45
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,300
OK, so that's for next time.

46
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,510
This is for this time.

47
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,820
So what I have in mind for
this time is: to begin,

48
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,690
can we solve our equation
starting from a source,

49
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,240
starting from a delta
function, a point source?

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,550
What's the solution look like?

51
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:27,950
And I guess when I
thought about it,

52
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,440
I can see several ways
to get at the answer

53
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:38,970
and it's a very worth it example
to do this from a point source.

54
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,610
It has a natural
interest and then

55
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,790
it comes up in many other ways.

56
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,950
So how we going
to get the answer?

57
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,990
Well, I can do it in
terms of fans and shocks.

58
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,900
Let me just proceed
informally at first.

59
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,660
The delta function is
like a step up followed

60
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,690
by a step down.

61
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,490
Well, a very big step up and
an immediate step down, right?

62
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,060
So it's the extreme
case of-- and remember

63
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,100
that the step up--
for the step up,

64
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,630
you remember the
Riemann problem?

65
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,830
Going from a lower
to a higher one.

66
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,245
That's the case where the
characteristics separate, leave

67
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:36,550
an open space that has to
be filled in with a fan.

68
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,860
So I would expect the
solution to start with a fan

69
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,300
and then I'm imagining
that as the limit

70
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,330
of an initial
function like this.

71
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:58,740
So that's step up,
will start a fan going

72
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,180
and then this step down
will start a shock going.

73
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:11,530
Because here, I have u is zero
and here u is something big

74
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:17,590
and that drop down means that
the characteristics from here

75
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,590
will immediately overtake-- the
characteristics from the zero,

76
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:28,810
starting from zero, have
zero speed, in the xt-plane,

77
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,290
they're just going up.

78
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,350
The characteristics that
start because of this thing

79
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,700
are going to the right,
so I'll have a shock.

80
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,290
So I'm expecting a
fan and then a shock

81
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,930
based on the previous lectures.

82
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,320
OK, and I'm going to
figure out what fan it is

83
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,490
and what shock it is
and where the shock is.

84
00:05:51,490 --> 00:06:00,860
Now what I have on here is an
exact formula for the solution.

85
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,030
You might say, why didn't
you tell me that before?

86
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,170
And I will plug
in the initial, it

87
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,170
comes from the initial function
and from a minimization process

88
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,560
and it's not obvious.

89
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,640
That's a funny way to describe
a function of x and t,

90
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,070
but of course it does.

91
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,810
x and t appear here,
y is the parameter

92
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,290
and I'm minimizing
with respect to y

93
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,430
and that will give us-- well, it
better give us the same answer.

94
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,250
So I'm taking this as an
important case, which gives us

95
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,520
a chance to review all the
pieces that came into the-- all

96
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,160
the rules that came into it.

97
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,420
We had the rules for a fan,
which was of the form x over t

98
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,950
if it started at zero.

99
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,190
We have the rules for a shock,
which was that the shock speed

100
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:08,300
should be the jump in f of
u-- which is u squared over 2

101
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,210
for Burgers'-- divided
by the jump in u.

102
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,630
And so that's a
difference of squares,

103
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,280
this is a difference
of first powers.

104
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,700
When I do that simple
division, it factors out

105
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,670
and I get a u_left
plus a u_right over 2,

106
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,460
the 2 coming from there,
and the difference

107
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,420
going into the difference
of squares gives me that.

108
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,470
OK, and then the other condition
was the entropy condition

109
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,180
that f prime-- remember,
this is f prime of u--

110
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,850
so f prime of u,
which is here, u.

111
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,520
So u_left should be
greater-- the shocks,

112
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,150
what's the rule on
the entropy condition?

113
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,500
That the characteristic
should run into the shock.

114
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,370
So coming from the left,
they should be faster.

115
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,590
We have some shock line--
it's increasing with a speed

116
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,500
s, which is d position
of the shock-- dx/dt,

117
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,340
and coming from the left, the
shocks should be going faster

118
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,660
and run into it.

119
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,200
Coming from the
right, the shocks--

120
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,350
the characteristics
should be slower

121
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,330
so that the shock
line catches them

122
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,410
and therefore, these
also run into the shock.

123
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:37,800
So this is f prime at u_right.

124
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,580
And remember here,
it's just u_left bigger

125
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,860
than the shock speed,
bigger than u_right.

126
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,150
Now I'm going to go
to the delta function

127
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,290
itself, which will
be cleaner and neater

128
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:59,710
than this steep square wave.

129
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,880
So we could pick any
of those as the key

130
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,660
to telling us-- this is what
I'm expecting for a solution.

131
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,730
Here is zero.

132
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,300
Here is x.

133
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,670
So I'm expecting that--
I guess I'll graph u.

134
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,200
u of x at some time t.

135
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,060
OK, so I'm graphing u
at some later time t.

136
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,500
OK, I'm expecting the solution
to be u equal zero here,

137
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,410
because it starts
at zero-- well,

138
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,110
I'm really-- now, when I point
to that figure, what I really

139
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,030
mean now is a delta function.

140
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,400
So this is infinitely
thin and infinitely tall.

141
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,810
So characteristics are going
to take off and well, who

142
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,990
can say-- you might think the
whole thing would break down

143
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,510
because the delta
function is in some sense,

144
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,150
infinite at that point.

145
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,160
But it doesn't.

146
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,890
You'll see that a very
sensible solution emerges here.

147
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:12,300
And it's a fan, so u
is x over t, I guess.

148
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:21,290
So u starts at zero-- yeah, let
me draw u at some later time t.

149
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:25,880
It's linear and
then it's a shock.

150
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,160
So this is what I
expect for the answer.

151
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,980
I expect u to be zero, x
over t up to some point,

152
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:43,620
up to the shock, up to--
x is the shock position,

153
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:50,880
and then after that
it has the value zero

154
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,410
because the initial
function hasn't changed,

155
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,710
hasn't got the message.

156
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:08,270
So this was after
x equal X of t.

157
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,120
That's what it should look like.

158
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,070
I'm proceeding here sort
of on the basis of what

159
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,610
we know about the solution.

160
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:26,310
And maybe I can just mention
that the text, the problems

161
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,210
at the end of the
section on conservation

162
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:35,680
laws in the Introduction
to Applied Math text

163
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,380
ask about a few other
initial functions.

164
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,960
For example, minus
the delta function.

165
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,310
Maybe we should think
through those questions.

166
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,740
Is the solution with minus the
delta function the negative

167
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,170
of this solution?

168
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,290
What do you think?

169
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,340
No.

170
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,110
This is a nonlinear
equation and that fact

171
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:11,600
shows up right away
in the possibility

172
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,090
that when you change the
sign of the initial function,

173
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,160
you don't just change
the sign of the solution.

174
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,460
And other things,
I could ask well,

175
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,120
suppose I have an
initial function

176
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,900
u_0 of x and I add 1 to it.

177
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,880
Does that add 1 to the
solution everywhere?

178
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,760
That's a question
to think about.

179
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,430
So these are sort
of questions that

180
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:42,380
are not finite differences,
but differential equations.

181
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,340
All that remains here is to
find the position of that shock.

182
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,480
I guess one way to do it-- OK,
I can think of several ways

183
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,620
to do it.

184
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,905
One way would be to use the
fact that the total mass is

185
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:00,610
conserved.

186
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,100
So the integral
of u at any time,

187
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,650
the integral of that
function from minus infinity

188
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,660
to infinity-- that's
the total mass--

189
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,670
has to agree with the initial
total mass, which is 1,

190
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,570
because the initial
density distribution was

191
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,670
that delta function
at the origin

192
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,960
and that we know
integrates to 1.

193
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,210
So one way to find this
position would be the fact

194
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:36,390
that the integral from zero to
the place that the fan ends--

195
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:45,080
that's a capital X-- of
x over t dx should be 1.

196
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,920
1 because it was initially 1.

197
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:56,140
So that's gives us capital X
squared over 2-- over 2t as 1.

198
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,190
In fact, I guess
I'm thinking now,

199
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,200
this approach
occurred to me sort of

200
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,590
as I was walking to class, I'm
thinking now that's unbeatable.

201
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:09,500
That tells us where
the shock position is,

202
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,030
capital X squared over
2t is 1, so capital X

203
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,730
is square root of 2t.

204
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:30,630
OK, we could take that
as a guess, if you like,

205
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:38,000
and verify that it obeys all
the nonlinear rules here.

206
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,710
Right now it just obeys the
fact that the total mass

207
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,170
is conserved, which is
like the minimal fact.

208
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,480
But of course, we've
built into this solution

209
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,990
an expectation of fan followed
by shock, which is now

210
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,090
what we really want to verify.

211
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,730
So I guess, what
should I check next?

212
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,360
I maybe should check
the shock speed.

213
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,170
Does this solution
with that shock

214
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,760
give me the correct shock speed?

215
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,030
OK, let me check that.

216
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,580
What's the shock
speed? s is the speed

217
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:25,020
of the shock, so it's the
derivative of square root of 2t

218
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,130
and what's that?

219
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:30,360
That's square root
of 2 t to the 1/2.

220
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,540
So that's square root
of 2 times t to the 1/2.

221
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,310
The derivative of t to the
1/2 is 1/2 t to the minus 1/2.

222
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,460
So it's 1 over
square root of 2t.

223
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,870
That's the shock speed for
this proposed solution.

224
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,980
If we decide that the shock
should be at that point.

225
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,550
Now what's supposed to happen?

226
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,710
What is it that I want to check?

227
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,490
I want to check that
the jump condition is

228
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,050
correct for this shock.

229
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,190
That if a shock speed is
that, so the question mark is,

230
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:18,100
is this-- so that's
the speed of the shock

231
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:23,880
as we're sort of conjecturing
it to be located.

232
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,430
And now the question is
whether that shock speed

233
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:34,130
agrees with u on the left
plus u on the right over 2.

234
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,570
So what do I have to check?

235
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:41,230
I have to check what is u
on the left of the shock

236
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,050
if this is my answer.

237
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:49,380
Well, the left of the
shock is the point when

238
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,660
x equals capital X. That's
where the shock happened,

239
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,280
so it's capital X over t.

240
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,440
Square root of 2t over t.

241
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:06,840
So the value of u square
root of 2t over t.

242
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,770
That's where the fan is.

243
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,640
That's this height and
that height is zero.

244
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,560
So it's the average
of this and zero.

245
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,770
So that's the jump condition.

246
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,040
So this is the jump
condition that we're

247
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:32,510
checking and is it right?

248
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,580
I hope so.

249
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,620
Otherwise we're in
mighty big trouble.

250
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,400
OK yes, I have the
same cancellation

251
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,620
of square root of 2
into 2 and t to the 1/2

252
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,480
leaves me with-- yes,
I'm left with that.

253
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,070
So yes.

254
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:59,530
Jump condition satisfied by
this conjectured solution.

255
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,570
What else?

256
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:07,100
Well, just having a shock
with the right speed

257
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,630
doesn't mean I've
got the right answer.

258
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,270
Doesn't mean I've
got the right answer,

259
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:17,790
can I just make that point
because it's easy to slip by.

260
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:25,740
Let me take an extreme
case where I compare.

261
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,460
So these comments
are going to be

262
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:35,270
to say that I really need to
check the entropy condition.

263
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,190
Because I could
have two problems.

264
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:47,800
One which started from initial
value minus 1 jumping to 1.

265
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,430
So that's a Riemann problem.

266
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:54,080
And the other which starts
from 1 and jumps to minus 1.

267
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,090
And I guess in both
cases, remember

268
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,010
that f of u, which
is u squared over 2,

269
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:11,160
is 1/2 on both sides of
that line x equals zero.

270
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,250
In other words,
could this solution

271
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:26,030
stay at minus 1 and this
solution stay at plus 1

272
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,740
and have a jump between them?

273
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,600
And same for this.

274
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,870
This solution could stay at
1, this could stay at minus 1

275
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,380
and have a jump.

276
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,940
And now of course,
in this case the jump

277
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,060
will be upwards
from minus 1 to 1.

278
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,180
In this case it'll be a
drop from 1 down to minus 1.

279
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:53,740
And I guess I think this one is
OK with the entropy condition

280
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,190
and this one is not OK.

281
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,310
Let me say again
what I'm meaning.

282
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:06,280
The fact that I've chosen
this simple example

283
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,420
with f of u equal u
squared so that 1 squared

284
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,010
and minus 1 squared
give me the same answer.

285
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,570
So the jump across this line
is zero, the speed of the shock

286
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,880
is zero, the jump
condition is OK.

287
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:30,440
So I'm saying that the jump
condition is OK for both.

288
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,540
And it's the right thing to
have the jump in this one,

289
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,790
but this is wrong.

290
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,740
There should be a
fan and I guess I've

291
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,480
forgotten how the fan will go.

292
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:54,230
We do have 1 here and we
do have minus 1 there,

293
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,180
but the value of u is connected
not by a jump at a point,

294
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,340
but by a fan that gets
us from there to there.

295
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,360
A fan is also known
as an expansion wave.

296
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,660
That's the right thing
to have for that problem.

297
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,470
All that is just
to say that I do

298
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,990
have to check the
entropy condition.

299
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:22,350
But I hope it's not going
to be too difficult.

300
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:27,960
So my entropy condition--
remember, for this special case

301
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,550
f prime is just u.

302
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,560
So I'm really just
checking, now,

303
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,300
u_L greater than the shock
speed, greater than u_R.

304
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,020
u_R is zero of course.

305
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,830
On this side of the
shock it's zero.

306
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,230
So the shock-- can you get that?

307
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,490
We're going to be OK on
the entropy condition.

308
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,740
The shock speed is greater than
zero and it's smaller than u_L.

309
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,010
Well, how is that?

310
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,110
Is this quantity,
the shock speed--

311
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,860
no, greater than--
is this shock speed--

312
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,550
so checking that entropy
condition means-- shall

313
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,760
I put it up here?

314
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:26,710
u_L bigger than-- so this was
the characteristic speeds,

315
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,530
the wave speeds on
the left of the shock.

316
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,610
They must run into the
shock, so they must

317
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,630
be going faster than the shock.

318
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:37,130
OK, so let me just do
this comparison. u_L

319
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,720
at the left of the shock, on the
left of the shock x is capital

320
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,990
X, which we decided was root 2t.

321
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:54,300
So this is root 2t over t.

322
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:59,830
That's u_left because
the shock starts

323
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:05,690
when x is equal to root 2t
and that's what u equals.

324
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:11,510
And the shock speed we
figured out here is 1 over.

325
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,100
Now, so the question
is, is this true?

326
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,440
1 over root 2t.

327
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,860
I guess I sure hope that it is.

328
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,350
And it is, of course.

329
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:29,910
If I multiply up by this, I
have 2t over t, which is just 2

330
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,050
is bigger than 1.

331
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,470
So the answer again, is yes.

332
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:46,870
So that completes checking that
our proposed solution of fan

333
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,780
then shock is OK.

334
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:58,460
But, now let me
come to this formula

335
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,810
because it's quite a
handy, useful formula.

336
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:09,010
And what I have here
is f of u divided by--

337
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,850
or f of x minus y divided by 2.

338
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,520
That something squared
over 2 divided by t.

339
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,350
Sorry, divided by t.

340
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,710
Well, what do I want to
say about that going on?

341
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:35,600
Well, first of all, if I do plug
in the delta function for u_0,

342
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,990
it gives the right answer.

343
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,890
I can easily do
this minimization.

344
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,290
What what do I get when I plug
in the delta function for u_0,

345
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:47,830
just to start on
trying this formula

346
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,780
to be sure it gives the same
answer that we just found?

347
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:57,290
So the integral of u of x
and zero, the integral of u

348
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,580
is a step function.

349
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,940
So this will be a step
function of 1 for y

350
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,140
greater than zero and
zero for y less than zero.

351
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,370
Minimization requires
a little patience

352
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:18,780
because a step function of y
is coming in here, y is there.

353
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,930
And the only way I would
know to do that minimum

354
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,940
would be the separate
the different cases

355
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,220
and do each one.

356
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,890
Each one would be simple.

357
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,560
I don't think we need to
take our time to do that.

358
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,000
It's going to give
the same answer

359
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,800
and the minimization
is actually carried out

360
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,880
in the applied math book.

361
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,210
But I would like to
say where it came from.

362
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,400
Where did this formula-- so
I'll go back to this formula.

363
00:25:53,400 --> 00:26:06,830
As a general formula
for any starting value,

364
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,630
starting function.

365
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,690
And in some way
derive the formula.

366
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:19,500
Figure out where
did that come from?

367
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,660
It came from the
Burgers' equation

368
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,430
with-- so now I want to
speak about this guy--

369
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:34,410
the Burgers' equation
with viscosity.

370
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,220
It turns out that that
equation-- and this

371
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,580
is very important.

372
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,880
That equation has
an exact solution,

373
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,260
because I can change
variables and make it linear.

374
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,870
I can turn it into
the heat equation.

375
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:53,230
So that was a neat idea,
which two people noticed

376
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,960
at almost the same time.

377
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,960
That very satisfying
change of variables

378
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,770
will turn this, will get
rid of this nonlinearity

379
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,740
and turn it into
the heat equation.

380
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,130
So it's a nonlinear change
of variables of course,

381
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,500
but not that hard to
discover once you begin

382
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,360
to hope that there is one.

383
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,210
And then, once it's a heat
equation we know the solution.

384
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,050
The linear heat equation
we know how to solve.

385
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,790
So we solve it and then what?

386
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:31,300
Let the viscosity nu go to zero.

387
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:37,250
Watch what this solution
is doing as nu goes to zero

388
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,660
and it will-- of
course, it'll be

389
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:47,520
smooth for any
positive value of new.

390
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,950
The viscosity keeps
things smooth.

391
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,870
The shock appears in the limit.

392
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,000
Maybe I should say something
just physically about waves,

393
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,040
breaking waves.

394
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,820
If you look at waves
in water, they're

395
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,660
obeying a nonlinear wave
equation, more complicated

396
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:17,630
than ours, but nevertheless
the same features.

397
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:26,080
And a wave forms and as
all water skiers know,

398
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,770
surfers know-- surfers,
I guess, know it best.

399
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:35,090
The wave in time
begins to break.

400
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:40,150
Now, up to that
time the viscosity

401
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,110
is actually not so important.

402
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,960
But as it begins
to break there's

403
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:52,540
a terrific u_xx now at the
moments before breaking.

404
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:01,020
And that u_xx then, that
term produces viscosity.

405
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,790
I mean, there is
a viscosity there

406
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,120
and suddenly it's important.

407
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,470
And so the viscosity will
prevent-- even though it's

408
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,850
small, the viscosity
will prevent

409
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:18,140
the actual, complete break.

410
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,050
I mean, what actually happens
in that wave is, of course,

411
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,360
a very difficult thing.

412
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,100
The nonlinearity,
turbulence-- everything's

413
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,990
happening suddenly.

414
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:36,550
Not easy, but the main point
is that as in many problems,

415
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:43,600
a term that's small in the case
of smooth solutions, where u_xx

416
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,480
has a normal size and nu is very
small, so that term is small.

417
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,180
Suddenly, u_xx has a
giant size and that term

418
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,890
is important,
physically important.

419
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,510
So Burgers' inviscid
equation, this

420
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:04,100
is the case with-- inviscid
means nu equals zero.

421
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,030
So Burgers' equation
is dropping that term

422
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,570
and it does have a shock,
as we very well know.

423
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,300
What are the steps
that these two people

424
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,670
noticed that take
Burgers' equation

425
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,680
and turn it into
the heat equation?

426
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:33,470
Let me see if I can
remember the two steps.

427
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,260
So I'm starting with
Burgers' equation

428
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,570
and I want to make
it the heat equation.

429
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:45,010
OK, so a first step is to
introduce the integral of u.

430
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,250
Let me call that capital U of x.

431
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,540
So capital U of x
will be the integral.

432
00:30:50,540 --> 00:31:02,130
So if I write it this way, I'm
going to change u to capital U.

433
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,870
So I'm introducing a
new variable capital

434
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,680
U. The linearity
won't disappear yet,

435
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,670
but it'll look a
little different.

436
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:19,100
So if I took this equation
and I look at its-- well,

437
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,730
let me just say,
what's the equation

438
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,050
going to look like
for capital U?

439
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,590
If I write it down, then
you'll see that it's right.

440
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:36,930
dU/dt plus-- instead of d by
dx it'll be 1/2 dU/dx squared

441
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,450
equals nu*U__xx.

442
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:52,800
I claim that that's Burgers'
equation written for capital

443
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,850
U. Do you see that?

444
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,160
Let me just see, well,
how do I get from there

445
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,870
to the equation with a
star, Burgers' equation?

446
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,290
I think I just take
the x derivative.

447
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,030
If I take the x
derivative of every term,

448
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:12,790
I'm taking the x derivative
of U, so that's a little u.

449
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,380
So I have d little
u dt, as I want.

450
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,620
If I'm taking the x
derivative of this term

451
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,870
I have little u_xx, as I want.

452
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,960
And if I take the x
derivative of this term

453
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,390
it'll produce that.

454
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,760
The x derivative,
the 2 will come here,

455
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,180
dU/dx will be the little u.

456
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,130
The x derivative of
that will be the u_x.

457
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,370
It's straightforward.

458
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:46,800
And so now I've got it in a
slightly different, but still

459
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,810
nonlinear form.

460
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,630
Still quadratic.

461
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,520
Now comes the nonlinear
change of variables.

462
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,720
I think it's u is
minus 2*nu log--

463
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,930
so that's the nonlinear part--
of the new unknown that I

464
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:08,800
finally want, which is w.

465
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,480
So that's an exponential
change of variable.

466
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:19,180
Capital U is matching log w,
so w is matching e to the minus

467
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,150
an exponential of u.

468
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:25,750
And I won't go
through the steps,

469
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,810
but when you introduce
that in this equation,

470
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:31,330
it turns into the heat equation.

471
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,670
Of course, the initial
function is different.

472
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:46,290
The initial w is different
from the initial u.

473
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:51,270
Well, in fact we could
see, at time zero--

474
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,500
so this was at all times.

475
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,900
I didn't write the t explicitly.

476
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,040
But at time zero,
what is w of zero?

477
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,970
I guess I just take
the exponential.

478
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:06,140
I put this over here and
take its exponential.

479
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:15,240
So w of x and zero will
be u of x and zero,

480
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:24,620
the starting value of u, divided
by minus 2*nu, all exponential.

481
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,810
This is the sort of expression,
e to the something divided

482
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,650
by-- with a minus
sign-- divided by 2*nu,

483
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,230
that we're going to meet.

484
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,000
We meet it in the
initial condition

485
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,460
and we meet it in the solution.

486
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,270
Well, actually we now
know the solution.

487
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:47,280
If we remember, what's the
solution to the heat equation?

488
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,570
So we have the heat equation.

489
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,590
There's a constant
in the heat equation,

490
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,970
so we just have to remember,
where does that constant go,

491
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,060
and that's actually worth doing.

492
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,060
And then we have to start it
from this initial condition.

493
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,590
Let me just write, over here,
the solution to the heat

494
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,090
equation.

495
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:16,390
So this board will
follow that board

496
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,370
and remember-- so do you
remember the solution

497
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,410
to the heat equation?

498
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,480
You remember, we know
the solution that

499
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,000
starts from a delta function,
that fundamental solution

500
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:39,050
is that e to the minus
whatever over 2t, is it?

501
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:39,970
Yeah.

502
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:45,040
So what is w of x and t?

503
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,400
Let's see.

504
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,130
So we have the heat equation.

505
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:54,120
There is a square root of
4*pi and now it's 4*pi*nu*t.

506
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,930
When nu was 1 we
didn't know that,

507
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:05,620
but now, essentially this nu,
I can change the time variable

508
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,500
to nu times t.

509
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,050
So everywhere I saw a t,
I now will see nu times t.

510
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,090
And then, do you remember
what went in here?

511
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:20,950
The initial value,
w of x and zero,

512
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:27,200
times the fundamental
solution, that bell curve

513
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:35,280
that is centered
at x, and grows--

514
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,570
so it's e to the minus-- do you
remember what it looked like?

515
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,280
I think there's an e
to the minus-- centered

516
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,760
at x, so it's x minus t
squared over-- was it 2?

517
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,840
Over 2t, it was, and
now there's a nu*t.

518
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,050
x minus-- oh, wait a minute.

519
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,240
I can't have x's.

520
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,900
Let me take w of s and zero,
e to the x minus s squared.

521
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,490
This is from minus
infinity to infinity.

522
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:19,850
And that, finally, is going
to give me w of x and t.

523
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,750
So I integrate ds.

524
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,850
It's actually good to go
back to and see something

525
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,000
that we derived
before but we haven't

526
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,760
thought about it for a while.

527
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,360
This is the fundamental solution
starting at the point s.

528
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,960
This is the amount
of initial function

529
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,930
there is at the point s.

530
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:06,190
And I integrate over all those
little starts of point sources.

531
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:10,000
I integrate over all the
sources, all the way from s

532
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,740
equal minus infinity
to infinity,

533
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,990
and I get that answer.

534
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,910
And now I know what
w of s and zero is.

535
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,570
That's what I just found.

536
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:24,660
This is e to the minus,
as we've just said,

537
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:32,460
capital U of x and zero--
U_0 I'll call it-- over 2*nu.

538
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,550
So for this, substitute this.

539
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:48,690
It's requiring patience, but
not genius I'd say, to do this.

540
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:53,350
Now the question is, what
happens as nu goes to zero

541
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:57,910
and that the thing that
makes this worth presenting.

542
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,680
What happens to
integrals like this?

543
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,700
I have an integral of
something and the exponentials

544
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,890
are both negative.

545
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,060
I've somehow an
integral like this.

546
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,130
I have the integral of some
e to the minus something--

547
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:21,070
I'll say B-- over nu ds.

548
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:27,480
Do you see that the B
involves the U_0 over 2?

549
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,160
Well, let me put a 2*nu.

550
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,650
This is really what I
have in this formula.

551
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,570
Well, divided by this thing, so
let me put that 1 over square

552
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,630
root outside.

553
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,780
And remember, my
question is, what

554
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,850
happens as nu goes to zero?

555
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:53,180
Do you have any idea--
I mean, it's a mess.

556
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,340
We do not want to
do this integration.

557
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:03,750
It's an exact formula, but
not one I want to deal with.

558
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:09,450
What I do want is to know what
happens as nu goes to zero.

559
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,730
And the main point is that nu is
showing up in the denominator.

560
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,820
We have some quantity
in the numerator,

561
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,380
what is that quantity?

562
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:28,400
That quantity is U_0 plus this
x minus x squared over 2*nu*t--

563
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:35,220
over t, because-- in
fact, if we're lucky,

564
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,270
this B is exactly this quantity.

565
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,940
This is exactly this bracket.

566
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:50,490
That's, I think, my B, if I
change letter from s to y.

567
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,780
If I'd been like
prepared in advance,

568
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,090
I wouldn't have
introduced y and s

569
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:01,140
because they're both
just dummy variables

570
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,130
and they should
have been the same.

571
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,960
You see that this
guy-- because, you

572
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,450
remember the change between
little u and capital U?

573
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:15,200
Capital U is just the integral.

574
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,390
So that's U_0.

575
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:24,200
And this is this x
minus y squared over 2t.

576
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,010
I'm not sure if I've
got a 2 somewhere lost,

577
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:36,000
but we won't worry about that.

578
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,060
The main point
that I want to make

579
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,580
is, how do you deal with
an integral like this?

580
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:46,280
Because this is like a major
topic in a more advanced course

581
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:52,800
on applied math, a more advanced
course on the analysis of

582
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,080
applied math, not the
numerical analysis.

583
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:07,130
What's happening as nu goes to
zero= Well, as nu goes to zero,

584
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,300
this thing is
getting very large.

585
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:15,270
e to the minus a
very large amount.

586
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:20,320
So it's as near nothing
as you can imagine.

587
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,470
e to the minus a
very negative amount.

588
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:25,550
But still, the total
is considered somehow,

589
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:29,920
and the question is, what's
the main leading term

590
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,500
in this quantity, and the
answer is, you look at the point

591
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:40,400
where B is a minimum.

592
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,311
If B at one point is 1, than we
have an e to the minus 1 over

593
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:44,810
2*nu.

594
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,720
And compared to e to
the minus 100 over 2*nu,

595
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,980
the e to the minus 1
over 2*nu is way bigger.

596
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,170
So that in the end,
the contribution all

597
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:03,740
comes from the point
where B is a minimum.

598
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,460
And that's what this formula
says we should look for.

599
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,910
And if you figure out
what that contribution is,

600
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:15,440
and taking into account the
fact that we do have a 4*pi*nu*t

601
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,140
here-- without this, the whole
thing would just be going

602
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:25,000
to zero as nu goes to zero; this
e to the minus very negative

603
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,610
stuff is zero.

604
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:33,000
But we have a nu here, so in the
end something nonzero emerges,

605
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,810
but it emerges totally at this
point where B is a minimum

606
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:42,090
and that's what this
formula has found.

607
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:45,300
This is the minimum value of b.

608
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,530
OK, I won't track down further.

609
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,850
Do I remember the right word?

610
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:55,260
Is it stationary phase?

611
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,870
Did anybody meet these words?

612
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:05,280
I'm speaking now about something
in the history of applied math.

613
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,500
Still, those tools
that were created

614
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,460
over the pre-computer
years are still

615
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,890
extremely valuable to
understand what's going on

616
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:19,840
and this is just
an illustration.

617
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:31,800
OK, that's my comments on the
limiting case of Burgers',

618
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,590
which is inviscid
Burgers', and we actually

619
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:43,440
used this form of the
equation as the first step

620
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,640
in linearization.

621
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,760
As I say, it's quite
a nice exercise, now,

622
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,050
to use this formula.

623
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:02,870
An explicit formula, which we,
last time, did not suspect.

624
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:06,640
We were tracking down-- we
knew the problem was nonlinear

625
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,240
and were tracking
down shocks and fans.

626
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,310
Here's a formula that just
plain gives us the answer.

627
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:19,710
So this gives us a shock
or a fan, whichever.

628
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:26,010
This has the right shock
speeds if there's a shock

629
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:29,390
and it has the right-- the
entropy condition is satisfied

630
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:34,330
because it was satisfied all
along as nu was going to zero.

631
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:38,060
OK, so now do I want to
make some final comments

632
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:42,390
on this Korteweg-de
Vries-- KdV-- equation.

633
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,020
I mean, that would be an
ideal numerical example.

634
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:03,260
In fact, its importance
was discovered numerically.

635
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,510
One could say that this
is one of the biggest

636
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:13,810
contributions of numerical
simulation to the theory

637
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,020
of nonlinear PDEs.

638
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:23,280
The discovery-- and it just came
out of the blue-- the discovery

639
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,360
that that particular
nonlinear equation was

640
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,320
what we might call integrable.

641
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:38,220
That there is some
twist that produce

642
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:42,860
linear equations whose
solution give the answer

643
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,770
to this nonlinear equation.

644
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,160
Maybe what I ought
to say is, first

645
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,770
to tell you what those
numerical experiments were like.

646
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:56,310
And people just like looked
at the answers and said,

647
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,430
can this be?

648
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:00,990
OK, what were they like?

649
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:04,960
So we could find--
without much work,

650
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:15,070
we could find solutions of the
form, of a traveling wave form.

651
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:20,720
So we could find solutions that
have the form some function

652
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,690
of x minus c*t.

653
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:34,320
If you plug that in, you
have then derivatives of f.

654
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,370
You have an ordinary
differential equation for f,

655
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:41,220
and you can actually
find shapes, waves that

656
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,760
travel following that equation.

657
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,430
So of course, what you
can't do is add two of them

658
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:53,100
together and still have a
solution because the equation

659
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,430
is not linear.

660
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:58,520
So everybody assumed, OK, people
had found these traveling waves

661
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,250
before and the
computer will-- if you

662
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,010
start with the right
initial condition,

663
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:06,290
the computer will
produce a traveling wave.

664
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:09,190
If you start with the
right initial condition,

665
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:12,550
the computer will show
two traveling waves

666
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:14,570
at different speeds.

667
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:19,480
This c will be different
from one wave to the other.

668
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,590
So what will happen
as time goes forward?

669
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:27,540
One wave will catch the other
one because it's going faster.

670
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:31,100
So the shapes of
each wave are known.

671
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,330
I think it's 1 over
hyperbolic cosine squared.

672
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:41,660
So we have one wave
going with a different c,

673
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:44,640
going faster than another wave.

674
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,800
We're computing along.

675
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:53,070
The fast wave catches the
slow wave and they interact.

676
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:56,420
Of course they interact because
the problem's nonlinear,

677
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,150
and you can't see what's
happening at the time

678
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,090
when the big one
catches the small one.

679
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:06,480
But you can keep computing.

680
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,380
And what happened was
that after this jumble

681
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,350
the fast wave emerged
with the same shape.

682
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:18,940
And the slow wave emerge
behind it with the same shape.

683
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:24,160
And there was some lag of
course, some delay moment,

684
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,830
which had been used
up in the jumble

685
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,510
as the one passed the other.

686
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,750
But they emerged
looking the same.

687
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,980
I mean, that's sort of
like a linear property.

688
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,550
Not exactly, because you
couldn't just add them,

689
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,710
it wasn't perfect, but
the shapes were perfect.

690
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:51,480
And that suggested that this
equation might have hidden

691
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,180
linearity that nobody noticed.

692
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,830
And then finally
that was discovered.

693
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,170
It was a search.

694
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:03,230
People found
conservation laws, it's

695
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,120
easy to show that
the integral of u

696
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,110
is conserved by this equation.

697
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:10,680
We've done that
a thousand times.

698
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,160
Then other integrals
are conserved

699
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,910
and if you just
like to do algebra,

700
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:20,120
a short list of conserved
quantities: integral of u,

701
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,910
integral of u squared and
a few others, not just

702
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:27,900
u cubed and u fourth, of course.

703
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,960
People were creating a list.

704
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,090
And then somebody saw how
to get an infinite number

705
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:34,420
of integrals.

706
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:40,470
So that was a suspicion that
the problem was integrable.

707
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,700
That if you could
find an infinite list

708
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:47,130
of conserved quantities,
conserved even

709
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:50,570
under this nonlinear
interaction term,

710
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,710
that somewhere
something was linear.

711
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:56,670
And then eventually, a
change of variables-- well,

712
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:59,270
more than a change of
variables, a total twist

713
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:06,670
was found to integrate it
and get an explicit answer.

714
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:09,520
That's more than I can
do, but I want to say,

715
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,070
of course, that
immediately set out

716
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:18,630
a mad search for other
nonlinear problems

717
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:22,980
that were in this sense
completely integrable.

718
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,480
And now, am I going to be able
to list some of the ones that

719
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,920
were discovered?

720
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,440
I think I can-- whoops--
not on that board.

721
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:38,280
So I'll just end with the
completely integrable nonlinear

722
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,240
equations.

723
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,860
And I don't know if
the list is complete;

724
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:50,860
the discovery of new ones
is like a major thing.

725
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,490
So we have Korteweg-de Vries.

726
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,370
That was this the first.

727
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,430
Then there was a nonlinear
Schrodinger equation.

728
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:02,450
And the solutions, I have to say
what the solutions are called.

729
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:06,480
Those waves that I
mentioned, which--

730
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,480
they're not quite
that bad-- are called

731
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,970
solitons, solitary waves.

732
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:16,870
And it was the interaction
of solitons and the fact

733
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,310
that they emerged
looking unchanged

734
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:24,600
that set off this horrific
effort to figure out

735
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,730
what was going on.

736
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:29,530
So I was going to write
nonlinear Schrodinger in here,

737
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:37,100
and without saying exactly
where the nonlinearity appears,

738
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,830
but you take
Schrodinger equation

739
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:45,360
and-- then oh, I'm
blanking out on other--

740
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,070
there are just a couple
more famous ones.

741
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,890
I'll put those
names into an e-mail

742
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,210
rather than stumble here.

743
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:02,880
OK, so that's a little
history, with no details,

744
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,770
of an incredibly special
class of nonlinear PDEs.

745
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:12,320
Well of course, the
Navier-Stokes equations

746
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,190
aren't on that list.

747
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:19,560
And we still don't
know, especially in 3D,

748
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,010
I guess that's one of the
million dollar Clay prizes,

749
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:28,690
is to know whether the
Navier-Stokes equations have

750
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,580
a solution for all time.

751
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,490
So that's one of these
seven famous prizes

752
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:38,260
of which one of the
seven, geometry analysis

753
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:42,230
prize, apparently that
problem has been solved.

754
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:44,490
So there are six to
go and one of them

755
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:49,230
is whether the Navier-Stokes
equations have solutions.

756
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:52,300
Actually, I'll just take one
more minute of your time.

757
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,430
Thank you.

758
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:58,070
People had, or somebody
had conjectured

759
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:01,160
some possible vortex
blow-up in which

760
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:07,570
maybe that was a case, that
was an example of nonexistence.

761
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:12,110
We could find a particular
initial function

762
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:16,170
that created such a
blow up in a small space

763
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:22,210
that the Navier-Stokes
equations couldn't be continued.

764
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:25,820
But big numerical experiments,
just reported in the last

765
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:30,400
weeks, show that that
particular example,

766
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:37,310
that somebody thought might
prove nonexistence after

767
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:41,210
a finite time, doesn't.

768
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:45,500
So it's back to the
drawing board, really.

769
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
I don't see how
numerically we're ever

770
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:53,550
going to see that it does exist,
but this numerical experiment

771
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:59,130
was sufficiently clear to say
that that particular phenomenon

772
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:02,930
that looked dangerous
didn't go wrong.

773
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:06,870
OK, so next time,
it's a little more

774
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:11,440
about numerical solutions
of these equations

775
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,660
and then about the
level set method.

776
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:20,150
And then, looking ahead,
we have a guest lecture

777
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,830
on financial mathematics,
the PDEs of financial math,

778
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:28,570
for everybody who wants to go
to New York and make a billion.

779
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:33,940
And then we're going
to very quickly

780
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,410
be in the second
part of the course,

781
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:41,750
on solving large linear systems.

782
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,920
OK, I'll see you Friday
then for level sets.

783
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,420
Good.

784
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,680
Thanks for your patience.

785
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:55,770
Hi.

786
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:56,690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

787
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,500
PROFESSOR: Of course I have.
